These are all excellent quality scans about 1500 pixels wide.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nScanner&amp;#039;s Comments:\n\nI think the comparisons to Clowes, while perhaps not completely invalid, are\ngenerally quite overstated.  Like Clowes, Tomine stands alone.  In my opinion\nhe and Clowes don&amp;#039;t play in the same ball park, but they do play in the same\nleague.  Wait... what do you care what I think?  You&amp;#039;re here for the scans, not\nmy editorial drivel.\n\nThis book is all material from before Tomine signed with Drawn and Quarterly.\nUnless you&amp;#039;ve seen his ancient and rare self-produced comics from the days\nbefore that, this will all be new material to you even though it&amp;#039;s actually\nolder.  These stories are not in the Drawn and Quarterly comics, at least not\nthe first 11 issues which is all I have.  The style here is Tomine all the way\neven though these stories are rough around the edges.  Literally.  He didn&amp;#039;t\nget around to obsessively drawing &quot;every straight line using a ruler&quot; until\nStammer, starting on page 77 of this book.\n\nThis is a small format trade paperback, only 5 1/2 inches wide by 8 1/2 inches\nhigh, so I went with 300 dpi for the first time in order to keep the scans nice\nand large.  I also cropped the daylights out of some massive whitespace, but\nthat&amp;#039;s all that got cut.  This is a cover to cover scan of the entire book,\ninside and out.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/32stories.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/32stories.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79c4a306067a468451e5337c981fe5ddbc3fcc1e","amp;dn":"32+Stories+-+Adrian+Tomine+-+Early+Optic+Nerve+before+D+and+Q","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79c4a306067a468451e5337c981fe5ddbc3fcc1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,196,163,6,6,122,70,132,81,229,51,124,152,31,229,221,188,63,204,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
