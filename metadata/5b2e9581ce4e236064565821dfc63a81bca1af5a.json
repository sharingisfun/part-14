But John Lee Hooker recorded in a great many more styles than that over a career that stretched across more than half a century. Those who'd learned from John Lee Hooker and appreciated his music's basic truths joined him with love and sensitivity on his last, best-selling records. The career that had begun at Detroit house rent parties ended fifty years later with platinum records and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Unlike so many bluesmen of old, John Lee Hooker died with wealth and acclaim in equal measure. It's something I can't figure out, he said in Europe in 1964, but I'm just trying toreach out to all kinds of publics. No one ever did a better job of making subtle changes to their basic mix to reach generation after generation, and the beauty of this collection is that we see those changes unfurling before us.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Boogie chillen                                       [03:08]\n02.Hobo blues                                           [03:02]\n03.Crawlin' king snake                                  [03:01]\n04.John l's house rent boogie                           [03:00]\n05.Leave my wife alone                                  [02:48]\n06.I'm in the mood                                      [03:07]\n07.Walkin' the boogie (alternate)                       [02:35]\n08.Sugar mama                                           [03:14]\n09.Dimples                                              [02:15]\n10.Boom boom                                            [02:34]\n11.It serves you right to suffer                        [05:11]\n12.One bourbon, one scotch, one beer                    [03:02]\n13.The waterfront                                       [05:19]\n14.I'm bad like jesse james                             [05:32]\n15.The motor city is burning                            [02:53]\n16.Think twice before you go                            [02:05]\n17.Back biters and syndicators                          [02:52]\n18.Burning hell (with canned heat)                      [05:29]\n19.The healer (with carlos santana)                     [05:39]\n20.I'm in the mood (with bonnie raitt)                  [04:30]\n________\n71:16 min\n 93,9 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
