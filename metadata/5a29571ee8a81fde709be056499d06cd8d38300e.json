Without excessive recourse to mathematics, this volume emphasizes on the UWB antenna design and equips readers with practical prediction techniques based on simple formulas and models. The big picture of UWB antenna technology would not be complete without addressing its applications, and this will serve to provide consultants with key clues for market gap analysis.\n\nContaining over 150 supporting illustrations and figures, this comprehensive overview of UWB technology, antenna design and applications is a vital source of information and reference for R&amp;D organizations, researchers, practitioners, consultants, RF professionals and communication engineers.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 212 pages\n# Publisher: Imperial College Press (October 15, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1848164912\n# ISBN-13: 978-1848164918","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a29571ee8a81fde709be056499d06cd8d38300e","amp;dn":"Ultrawideband+Antennas%3A+Design+and+Applications+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a29571ee8a81fde709be056499d06cd8d38300e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,41,87,30,232,168,31,222,112,155,224,86,73,157,6,205,141,56,48,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
