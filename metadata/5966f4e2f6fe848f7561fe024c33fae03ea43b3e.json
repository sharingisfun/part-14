The guy has a resume a mile long, having lent his stringed instrument skills to recordings by Leonard Cohen, Linda Ronstadt, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, James Taylor and John Fahey, among many others. He was also a founding member of the obscure-but-excellent psych group Kaleidoscope, a collective that made two adventurous, West Coast-Meets-Middle-East LPs in the late 1960s. But by the time he recorded his solo debut, Artist Proof, in 1972, Chris had his feet firmly planted in the USAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fertile musical soil, with songs that drew from classic country, cajun fiddle grooves, traditional string band music and much more, all given a freewheeling, cosmic Americana spin. Through 11 sparkling tracks, Darrow proves himself to be a master songwriter, switching easily from the breezy late-period Byrds vibe of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beware of TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the gorgeous melancholy of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Sky Is Not Blue Today.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Freshly reissued and expanded by Drag City, Artist Proof is yet another where-have-you-been-all-my-life records. A California country-rock classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5966f4e2f6fe848f7561fe024c33fae03ea43b3e","amp;dn":"Chris+Darrow+-+Artist+Proof+-+%281972%29+v0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5966f4e2f6fe848f7561fe024c33fae03ea43b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,102,244,226,246,254,132,143,117,97,254,2,76,51,250,224,62,164,59,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
