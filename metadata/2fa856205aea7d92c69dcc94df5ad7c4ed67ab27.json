Three young friends, eager to take their shot at the top, accept funding from a grieving mother whose son fell to his death on Mt. Everest two years earlier. But she refuses to believe he's dead, and wants them to bring him back alive.\n\nAs they set off toward Everest, the men encounter other hikers who are seeking the boy's body for their own mysterious reasons. What valuable item could he have been carrying? What is the truth behind the many disappearances on the mountain? As they journey to the top of the world, the three friends face abominable choices, actions--and possibly creatures. A bone-chilling, pulse-pounding story of supernatural suspense, THE ABOMINABLE is Dan Simmons at his best.\nGenre: Horror, Suspense\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fa856205aea7d92c69dcc94df5ad7c4ed67ab27","amp;dn":"The+Abominable+-+Dan+Simmons.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fa856205aea7d92c69dcc94df5ad7c4ed67ab27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,168,86,32,90,234,125,146,198,157,204,148,223,90,215,196,237,103,171,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
