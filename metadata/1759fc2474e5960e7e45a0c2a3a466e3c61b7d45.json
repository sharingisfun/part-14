Waking Ned Devine is about the waking up of a small village that has been fast asleep since the start. The side stories of love, friendship and greed do not fall short. They in fact add to the greatness of this comedy. A delight for the entire family, even the quick scenes of a 70 year old naked man on a motor cycle comes out to be nothing more than good clean fun. An original idea made into a terrific movie. An enjoyable story with wonderful and like-able characters.\n\n  Starring: Ian Bannen, David Kelly, Fionnula Flanagan, Susan Lynch, James Nesbitt.\n\n  Directed by: Kirk Jones.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr.  31min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x  336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1759fc2474e5960e7e45a0c2a3a466e3c61b7d45","amp;dn":"Waking+Ned+Devine+%281998%29+%28Ian+Bannen%2C+David+Kelly%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1759fc2474e5960e7e45a0c2a3a466e3c61b7d45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,89,252,36,116,229,150,14,126,69,160,194,163,164,102,227,198,27,125,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
