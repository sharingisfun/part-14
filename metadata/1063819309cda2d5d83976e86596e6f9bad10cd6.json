Working together as three songwriters, the trio quickly developed a sound that threw back to early-'90's Manchurian indie rock, with particular likenesses to some of the scene's greats like Oasis, Primal Scream, and Happy Mondays. The band quickly signed to tiny label I Oh You on the strength of their home-recorded demos, and before long their debut single &quot;Delete&quot; climbed the charts and gained them praise from the press, musical peers, and a growing fan base. Their self-titled debut EP surfaced in the summer of 2014 and touring ensued. \n\nDma's\n1. Laced\n2. Your Low\n3. Delete\n4. Feels Like 37\n5. The Plan\n6. So We Know \n\nDma's - US EP\n1. Laced\n2.
