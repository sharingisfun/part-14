This is despite the fact that the patients PAID for the machines and they OWN it.  Instead, software available only to doctors is the only way to access the information on the SD card, making it necessary for patients to pay for a doctor visit to see their sleep breathing patterns and adjust the settings.  Well NO MORE, at least not if you own a Resmed CPAP machine with an SD card, like the S9, S8, or S10.  If you go to the sleepanpea board or cpaptalk forums, you can see how to interpret and use this program.  However, getting it can be a pain in the ass, thanks to Resmed.  So here you go.\n\nPLEASE, Community, keep this torrent alive along with all other CPAP torrents.  It will unshackle all those patients who own their CPAP machines so that they can own their own data!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21e5722541c28477dcad0cb98fcc5965461cf1a","amp;dn":"ResScan+5.1+CPAP+Data+Software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21e5722541c28477dcad0cb98fcc5965461cf1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,30,87,34,84,28,40,71,125,202,208,203,152,252,197,150,84,97,207,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
