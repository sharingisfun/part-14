LeclÃƒÂ¨re, a supporter of the exiled NapolÃƒÂ©on I, found himself dying at sea and charged DantÃƒÂ¨s to deliver two objects: a package to Marshall Bertrand (exiled with Napoleon Bonaparte on Elba), and a letter from Elba to an unknown man in Paris. On the eve of his wedding to MercÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ¨s, Fernand (MercÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ¨s' cousin and a rival for her affections) is given subtle advice by DantÃƒÂ¨s's colleague Danglars (who is jealous of his rapid rise to captain), to send an anonymous note accusing DantÃƒÂ¨s of being a Bonapartist traitor. Caderousse (DantÃƒÂ¨s's cowardly and selfish neighbor) is drunk while the two conspirators set the trap for DantÃƒÂ¨s, and while he objects to the idea of hurting DantÃƒÂ¨s, he stays quiet the next day as DantÃƒÂ¨s is arrested then sentenced even though his testimony could have stopped the entire scandal from happening. Villefort, the deputy crown prosecutor in Marseille, while initially sympathetic to DantÃƒÂ¨s, destroys the letter from Elba when he discovers that it is addressed to his own father, a Bonapartist. In order to silence DantÃƒÂ¨s, he condemns him without trial to life imprisonment.\n\nAfter six years of imprisonment in the ChÃƒÂ¢teau d'If, DantÃƒÂ¨s is on the verge of suicide when he befriends the AbbÃƒÂ© Faria (&quot;The Mad Priest&quot;), a fellow prisoner who he hears trying to tunnel his way to freedom. Faria's calculations on his tunnel were off, and it ends up connecting the two prisoners' cells rather than leading to freedom. Over the course of the next eight years, Faria comes to give DantÃƒÂ¨s an extensive education in language, culture, and science. He also explains to DantÃƒÂ¨s how Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort would each have had their own reasons for wanting DantÃƒÂ¨s in prison. Knowing himself to be close to death, Faria tells DantÃƒÂ¨s the location of a treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. When Faria dies, DantÃƒÂ¨s takes his place in the burial sack, moving the corpse to his own bed through their tunnel. When the guards throw the sack into the sea, DantÃƒÂ¨s escapes and swims to a nearby island where he is rescued by a smuggling ship the next morning. After several months of working with the smugglers, the ship makes a stop at Monte Cristo. DantÃƒÂ¨s fakes an injury and persuades the smugglers to leave him temporarily on the island while they finish their trip without him. He then makes his way to the hiding place of the treasure. After recovering the treasure, he leaves the smuggling business, buys a yacht, and returns to Marseille, where he begins to find out what became of everyone from his previous life. He later purchases both the island of Monte Cristo and the title of Count from the Tuscan government.\n\nReturning to Marseille, DantÃƒÂ¨s learns that his father died of starvation during his imprisonment, but before embarking on his efforts for revenge, he first helps several people who were kind to him before his imprisonment. Traveling as the AbbÃƒÂ© Busoni, he meets Caderousse, now living in poverty, whose intervention might have saved DantÃƒÂ¨s from prison. DantÃƒÂ¨s learns that his other enemies have all become wealthy. He gives Caderousse a diamond that can be either a chance to redeem himself, or a trap that will lead to his ruin. Learning that his old employer Morrel is on the verge of bankruptcy, DantÃƒÂ¨s, in the guise of a senior clerk from a banking firm, buys all of Morrel's outstanding debts and gives Morrel an extension of three months to fulfill his obligations. At the end of the three months and with no way to repay his debts, Morrel is about to commit suicide when he learns that all of his debts have been mysteriously paid and that one of his lost ships has returned with a full cargo, secretly rebuilt and laden by DantÃƒÂ¨s. DantÃƒÂ¨s rejoices at the Morrel family's joy, then pledges to banish all warm sentiments from his heart and dedicate himself to vengeance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:474d23f7f55e4b8a09c3c447d55570c5a6d466e0","amp;dn":"The+Count+of+Monte+Cristo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"474d23f7f55e4b8a09c3c447d55570c5a6d466e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,77,35,247,245,94,75,138,9,195,196,71,213,85,112,197,166,212,102,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
