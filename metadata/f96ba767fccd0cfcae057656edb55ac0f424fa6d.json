Now, fresh out of law school, and with an upcoming bar exam to prepare for, the highly motivated and strictly disciplined Jason returns to the small Southern town he grew up in to spend the summer studying.\n\nHe reconnects with Paul - a &quot;shoulda been&quot; actor who has just returned from Los Angeles, and Layla - an old friend whose childhood crush on Jason returns with his sudden reemergence, sending her engagement into a tailspin. But it is a chance-encounter with David - a pastor at a local church - that changes his life forever.\n\nDavid offers Jason a part time summer job as a youth director, and he reluctantly accepts it caving into the pressure from Layla and the need for some extra summer cash. But as he gets to know the kids and their individual struggles, he gradually discovers a passion that he didn't know existed within him and he soon realizes that his dad's life-long question has now become his own.\n \nRuntime: 97 mins\nLanguage: English\nYear: 2009\nQuality: 10/10\nFormat: avi format \n\nSee reviews here,  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-River-Within-Josh-Odor/dp/B002LFPBLA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-River-Within-Josh-Odor/dp/B002LFPBLA&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI would ask every Christian to do 2 things.\n\n1. If possible please buy this movie. Do you know that there are 2.2 billion Christians on earth today. But only a privileged few, around 12% have the means and the accessibility to buy Christian films. Many Christians are too poor to buy movies or live in places where Christian films are not available. \nThat's not all. Out of the 12% who have the means and accessibility to buy Christian media, only around 0.5% ever buys a Christian movie. In other words only 1 out of 200 Christians ever buys a Christian movie. Pathetic isn't it?\nPlease buy the movies to keep Christian films in business. And please do pray for the Christian movie makers and their families.\n\n2. Please seed the movies for as long as possible. If possible make copies and distribute to your poor neighbors. And please do pray for the movie makers and their families. Remember the Kingdom of Heaven is in you and so is the choice of Heaven/Hell. \n\nPS: If you need any specific Christian movie or have something to say then kindly send a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d8b1b6bcb1b9b6bbb0aab1abacb1b9b6eae8e8e198a1b9b0b7b7f6bbb7f6b1b6&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nKindly mention the subject as Christian Movies or something similar. \n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! He has done all he could. Tell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96ba767fccd0cfcae057656edb55ac0f424fa6d","amp;dn":"The+River+Within+%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96ba767fccd0cfcae057656edb55ac0f424fa6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,107,167,103,252,205,12,252,174,5,118,86,237,181,90,192,244,36,250,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
