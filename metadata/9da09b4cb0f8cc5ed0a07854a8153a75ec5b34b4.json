Later, he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, inadvertently interrupting an assassination by a feared Ninja-cult. As he is now the only man to have seen the face of the cult's warrior-leader and lived, he soon realizes that he is facing a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy. Teaming up with a friendly samurai couple, on a two-centuries-old blood-feud with the Ninja, he struggles to survive. Finally, recuperating on an island-fortress, he learns swordsmanship, and perhaps, a little about courage, honor, love, and loyalty. The requisite final confrontation is rife with bloody swordplay and spectacular martial-arts action sequences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9da09b4cb0f8cc5ed0a07854a8153a75ec5b34b4","amp;dn":"The+Hunted+%281995%29+DVDRip+%28Christopher+Lambert%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9da09b4cb0f8cc5ed0a07854a8153a75ec5b34b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,160,155,76,176,248,204,94,208,160,120,84,168,21,58,117,236,91,52,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
