We have an amazing Wicked Cool Christmas gift for you this year. How about Keith Richards classic Run Rudolph Run available for the first time on CD! Bob Segers extremely rare Sock It To Me never available on a single compilation, Darlene Love and the E Street bands All Alone On Christmas only available on a hard to find soundtrack. Plus favorite Christmas classics by The Kinks, The Ramones, Clarence Carter, Rufus Thomas, Roy Wood, and the impossible to find Santa Claus is Surfin To Town by the totally amazing Soupy Sales! Were proud of all our records but this one is not only the coolest Christmas party record ever itÃ‚Â¹s full of collectible classics as well. Happy Holidays baby! Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Little Steven Van Zandt\n\n---------\n\nLeave it to Little Steven to come up with an exquistely hip and fun Christmas set that perfectly balances rockin' chestnuts with deep-vault obscurites. While tracks such as the Kinks' &quot;Father Christmas,&quot; Clarence Carter's &quot;Backdoor Santa,&quot; and the Ramones' &quot;Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)&quot; are perennial favorites for those who require something a bit more jumpin' than Bing Crosby, the presence of Bob Seger's killer &quot;Sock It to Me Santa&quot; and Keith Richards's &quot;Run Rudolph Run&quot; alone make CHRISTMAS A GO-GO a seasonal must-have. Other stand-out Yuletide jams include Roy Wood's &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday,&quot; Soupy Sales's &quot;Santa Clause is Surfin to Town,&quot; and the ridiculously funky &quot;I'll be Your Santa&quot; by Rufus Thomas.\n\n01 - Keith Richards - Run Rudolph Run\n02 - Bob Seger and the Last Heard - Sock it to Me Santa\n03 - Ramones - Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight)\n04 - Darlene Love &amp; the E Street Band - All Alone on Christmas\n05 - Clarence Carter - Back Door Santa\n06 - The Len Price 3 - It's Christmas Time Ebenezer\n07 - Wizzard - I Wish It Could be Christmas Every Day\n08 - The Fab Four - Silent Night\n09 - Tina Sugandh - White Christmas\n10 - The Chevelles - Come All Ye Faithful Surfer Girls\n11 - The Brian Setzer Orchestra - Santa Drives a Hot Rod\n12 - Soupy Sales - Santa Claus is Surfin' to Town\n13 - Cocktail Slippers - Santa's Coming Home\n14 - Joe Pesci - If It Doesn't Snow on Christmas\n15 - Boss Martians - 3 Ghosts\n16 - Rufus Thomas - I'll Be Your Santa Baby\n17 - The Chesterfield Kings - Hey Santa Claus\n18 - The Electric Prunes - Jingle Bells\n19 - The Kinks - Father Christmas\n20 - Jean Beauvoir - Merry Christmas to All the World\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 10/21/2008\nUPC: 856385001756\nLabel: Wicked Cool Record\nCatalog Number: 500175\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e53ddb271dc885c57e401f0b5777f13e18af1c","amp;dn":"Little+Steven%27s+Underground+Garage+Presents+CHRISTMAS+A+GO-GO+%5BV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e53ddb271dc885c57e401f0b5777f13e18af1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,229,61,219,39,29,200,133,197,126,64,31,11,87,119,241,62,24,175,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
