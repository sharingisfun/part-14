Translucent Blues is a hard driving, blues, rock and jazz inflected effort; a fresh, contemporary recording bristling with soul, intensity and creative energy. The album features songs with multi-layered arrangements, solid driving grooves and stylistic depth. They are energetic and strong - with music and lyric collaborations from Manzarek and Rogers, and lyric contributions from the likes of Warren Zevon and Jim Carroll.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
