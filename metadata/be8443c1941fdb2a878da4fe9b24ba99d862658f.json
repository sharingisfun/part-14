He is the personal adviser to ten high-ranking CEOs and is kept on retainer by fifty Fortune 100 companies. Dr. RapailleÃƒÂ¢??s unique approach to marketing combines a psychiatrist&amp;#039;s depth of analysis with a businessman&amp;#039;s attention to practical concerns. His technique for market research has grown out of his work in the areas of psychiatry, psychology, and cultural anthropology. Dr. Rapaille&amp;#039;s psychiatric work and research with autistic children led him to develop a new process for understanding how children are imprinted for the first time. He has been profiled in many national media outlets, including 60 Minutes II and on the front page of the New York Times Sunday Styles section.\n\n\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be8443c1941fdb2a878da4fe9b24ba99d862658f","amp;dn":"%28PDF%29+%28Manifesto%29+Know+the+Codes+Why+We+Act%2C+Buy%2C+and+Love+as+We","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be8443c1941fdb2a878da4fe9b24ba99d862658f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,132,67,193,148,31,219,42,135,141,164,254,155,36,186,153,216,98,101,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
