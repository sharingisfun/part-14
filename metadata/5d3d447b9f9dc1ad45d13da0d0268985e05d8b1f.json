A sequel to Valve's previous Team Fortress Classic, it was first released as part of the video game compilation The Orange Box on October 10, 2007 for Windows and the Xbox 360.[1] A PlayStation 3 version then followed on November 22, 2007.[2] The game was later released as a standalone package for Windows on April 9, 2008. Team Fortress 2 was distributed online through the Steam system, while retail distribution was handled by Electronic Arts. The development of Team Fortress 2 was led by John Cook and Robin Walker, the designers who originally created the Team Fortress modification for Quake in 1996.\n\nLike its predecessors, Team Fortress 2 is focused around two opposing teams competing for an objective. These teams, Reliable Excavation &amp; Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU), are meant to represent two holding corporations that between them secretly control every government on the planet.[13] Players can choose to play as one of nine classes in these teams, each with his own unique strengths and weaknesses. Although the abilities of a number of classes have changed from earlier Team Fortress incarnations, the basic elements of each class have remained.[14][15] The game was released with six official maps, although 13 extra maps and eight arena maps have been included in subsequent updates.[16][17] In addition, a number of community assembled maps have been released. When players join a level for the first time, an introductory video shows how to complete its objectives. During matches, an eternally dissatisfied woman voiced by Ellen McLain announces various game events over loudspeakers.[18] The player limit is 16 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[19] On the PC, a vanilla server can hold 24 players, but in 2008 Valve updated Team Fortress 2 to include a server variable that allows up to 32 players.[20] Third party modifications have made it possible to host up to 34 players on one server.\n\n\n[RUS]\nTeam Fortress 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â° Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â² Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¶Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Âµ Ãƒâ€˜Ã‹â€ Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â° Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°, Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â±Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ Valve Corporation Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â² 2007 Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™.\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Team Fortress 2 Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â° (Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾ 1965 Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´), Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â² Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼ Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â±Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã…Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Âµ Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Âµ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ RED Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸ BLU.
