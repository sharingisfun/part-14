Eldest sister Rowena was taught to value people, not wealth or status. But everything she believes will be tested when Sir Philip dies, and the girls must live under their uncleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guardianship at the vast family estate, Summerset Abbey. Standing up for a beloved family member sequestered to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“underclassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in this privileged new world, and drawn into the Cunning Coterie, an exclusive social circle of aristocratic Ã¢â‚¬Å“rebels,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rowena must decide where her true passionsÃ¢â‚¬â€and loyaltiesÃ¢â‚¬â€lie. \n\nVictoria Buxton \n\nFrail in body but filled with an audacious spirit, Victoria secretly dreams of attending university to become a botanist like her father. But this most unladylike wish is not her only secretÃ¢â‚¬â€Victoria has stumbled upon a family scandal that, if revealed, has the potential to change lives forever. . . . \n\nPrudence Tate \n\nPrudence was lovingly brought up alongside Victoria and Rowena, and their bond is as strong as blood. But by birth she is a governessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, and to the lord of Summerset Abbey, that makes her a commoner who must take her true place in societyÃ¢â‚¬â€as ladyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s maid to her beloved Ã¢â‚¬Å“sisters.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But Pru doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t belong in the downstairs world of the household staff any more than she belongs upstairs with the Buxton girls. And when a young lord catches her eye, she begins to wonder if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever truly carve out a place for herself at Summerset Abbey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65e67d8a3e2bd5eca8bf867b02b9c52620547303","amp;dn":"T.J.+Brown+Summerset+Abbey+%28Book+01%29+%28mobi+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65e67d8a3e2bd5eca8bf867b02b9c52620547303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,230,125,138,62,43,213,236,168,191,134,123,2,185,197,38,32,84,115,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
