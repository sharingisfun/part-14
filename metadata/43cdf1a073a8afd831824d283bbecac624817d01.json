Kris is considered a country artist (although he treads the borders of rock and folk as well), but this is not a collection of his most 'country' songs. Rather this CD combines two of his lesser known albums, &quot;Repossessed&quot; from 1986 and &quot;Third World Warrior&quot; from 1990. - - - - - Although his music was always political, this period is when it was the most explicitly so. Shipwrecked in the Eighties&quot; was dedicated to the Vietnam vets. &quot;They Killed Him&quot; is about all those activists who were assassinated (King, Ghandi, Christ). The other songs on &quot;Repossessed&quot; are along the same vein, most show Kristofferson's trademark sarcastic cynicism. &quot;The Heart&quot; and &quot;Love is the Way&quot; are a bit more upbeat.  - - - - - &quot;Third World Warrior&quot; is something of a concept album about Reagon's dirty war in Nicaragua. Given that, the album is surprisingly accessible and universal. &quot;The Hero&quot; and &quot;Don't Let the Bastards (Get You Down)&quot; are among the better songs. Willie Nelson duets on the tribute &quot;Jesse Jackson&quot;.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Mean Old Man\n[02] Shipwrecked In The Eighties\n[03] They Killed Him\n[04] What About Me\n[05] El Gavilan (The Hawk)\n[06] El Coyote\n[07] Anthem 84\n[08] The Heart\n[09] The Old Road\n[10] Love Is The Way\n[11] The Eagle And The Bear\n[12] Third World Warrior\n[13] Aguila Del Norte\n[14] The Hero\n[15] Don't Let The Bastards (Get You Down)\n[16] Love Of Money\n[17] Third World War\n[18] Jesse Jackson\n[19] Mal Sacate\n[20] Sandinista\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:10m:39s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 169mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi 200dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Country Rock Folk\n\nOriginally Released\t- 06 April 1998\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Spectrum Music\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.kriskristofferson.com \n\t\t\t- http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kristofferson_kris/artist.jhtml \n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/Kris+Kristofferson \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/kriskristofferson \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For The Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43cdf1a073a8afd831824d283bbecac624817d01","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+The+Country+Collection+-+Kris+Kristofferson+%40+320kbs+%5Bonl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43cdf1a073a8afd831824d283bbecac624817d01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,205,241,160,115,168,175,216,49,130,77,40,59,190,202,198,36,129,125,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
