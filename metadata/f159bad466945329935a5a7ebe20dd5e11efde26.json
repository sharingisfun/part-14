Released on December 7, 2010 by Universal Republic Records, it is the band's successor to Take It to the Limit, which was released in 2008. All American Nightmare is significantly heavier in sound than either of the band's previous two records.\r\n\r\nWhile the album was to come out in the second half of 2010, it was then released on December 7.\r\n\r\nThe first single, the title track of the album, was released on September 14, 2010 and made available for digital download on October 5.\r\n\r\nThe album's cover art was released on November 3, 2010, featuring model Jesse Lee Denning on the cover, who also performed in the music video for &quot;All American Nightmare.\r\n\r\n&quot; Jesse Lee Denning is a tattoo/fashion model and is dating Brian Deneeve (song-writer and former guitarist for &quot;From Autumn to Ashes&quot;). The band has been quoted as jokingly saying that all anyone talks about is Jesse Lee as opposed to their songs.\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nAll songs written by Austin Winkler, Cody Hanson and The Warren Brothers, except where noted.\r\n\r\nThe following is the track listing for All American Nightmare:\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;2 Sides of Me&quot;   \t3:26\r\n2. \t&quot;All American Nightmare&quot; (Winkler, Hanson, Warren bros., Kevin Churko, Marshal Dutton) \t3:18\r\n3. \t&quot;What Ya Gonna Do&quot;   \t4:08\r\n4. \t&quot;Hey Ho&quot; (Winkler, Hanson, Warren bros., Churko, Dutton) \t3:37\r\n5. \t&quot;The Life&quot;   \t3:39\r\n6. \t&quot;Waking Up the Devil&quot;   \t4:14\r\n7. \t&quot;Red Tail Lights&quot; (Winkler, Hanson, Jeffrey Steele) \t3:49\r\n8. \t&quot;Striptease&quot;   \t3:30\r\n9. \t&quot;Everybody's Wrong&quot;   \t3:42\r\n10. \t&quot;Put That Record On&quot;   \t3:39\r\n\r\nTotal length:\r\n\t36:59\r\n\r\nDeluxe Edition\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\r\n11. \t&quot;Good Life&quot;   \t3:35\r\n12. \t&quot;Bad Mutha Fucka&quot;   \t3:35\r\n13. \t&quot;Put That Record On&quot; (demo version) \t3:43\r\n14. \t&quot;What Ya Gonna Do&quot; (demo version) \t4:14\r\n15. \t&quot;2 Sides of Me&quot; (demo version - iTunes exclusive) \t3:16\r\n16. \t&quot;All American Nightmare&quot; (music video)\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\n    Austin Winkler - lead vocals, acoustic guitar\r\n    Joe Garvey - lead guitar\r\n    Mark King - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Mike Rodden - bass guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Cody Hanson - drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f159bad466945329935a5a7ebe20dd5e11efde26","amp;dn":"Hinder+-+All+American+Nightmare+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+2010+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f159bad466945329935a5a7ebe20dd5e11efde26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,89,186,212,102,148,83,41,147,90,90,126,190,32,221,94,17,239,222,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
