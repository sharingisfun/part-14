There are interviews with such associates as Carmen McRae, Annie Ross, Buck Clayton, and Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison, among others. Although Ruby Dee's readings from Lady Day's largely fictional memoirs are a bit frivolous, the clips (particularly the rare ones taken from 1958 and 1959 television shows) are quite fascinating. Overall, this interesting tribute is quite even-handed and worth acquiring by Billie Holiday collectors and admirers.\nSoundTrack: 1. Opening / 2. Raw Genius / 3. Growing Up In Baltimore / 4.
