Ron Hubbard, claims to be the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fastest growing religion, with millions of members around the world and huge financial holdings. Its celebrity believers keep its profile high, and its teams of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvolunteer ministersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ offer aid at disaster sites such as Haiti and the World Trade Center. But Scientology is also a notably closed faith, harassing journalists and others through litigation and intimidation, even infiltrating the highest levels of the government to further its goals. Its attacks on psychiatry and its requirement that believers pay as much as tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars for salvation have drawn scrutiny and skepticism. And ex-members use the Internet to share stories of harassment and abuse. \n\nNow Janet Reitman offers the first full journalistic history of the Church of Scientology, in an evenhanded account that at last establishes the astonishing truth about the controversial religion. She traces ScientologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s development from the birth of Dianetics to today, following its metamorphosis from a pseudoscientific self-help group to a worldwide spiritual corporation with profound control over its followers and even ex-followers. \n\nBased on five years of research, unprecedented access to Church officials, confidential documents, and extensive interviews with current and former Scientologists, this is the defining book about a little-known world. \n\nJuly 2011\nPublisher: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt\nFormat: Hardcover 464pp \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a760cc002e9b1240fe105fc4907e90fb59c64d","amp;dn":"Inside+Scientology+-+America%5C%27s+Secret+Religion+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a760cc002e9b1240fe105fc4907e90fb59c64d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,167,96,204,0,46,155,18,64,254,16,95,196,144,126,144,251,89,198,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
