And rather than reading it apart from the rest of the Bible, you'll discover how the Apocalypse contains many of the critical interpretive keys necessary to understanding the entire Gospel! You'll learn why Revelation is the ultimate &quot;unveiling&quot; whereby the Lord of the Universe reveals Himself to His Bride, the Church. And how its twenty-two chapters are a timely and timeless message of hope for believers suffering persecution and for those others struggling not to lose faith. With scholarly precision, Dr. Hahn examines the various ways that Protestants and Catholics understand the Book of Revelation, revealing how the prophecies of the Book of Revelation were first realized in the first century transition from the Old Covenant to the New, and how these prophecies ultimately point to a future fulfillment when all of God's creation will give way to a &quot;new heaven and a new earth&quot; when Christ Jesus will triumphantly return to judge the living and the dead.\r\n\r\nOpen Up New Avenues of Understanding\r\n\r\nUnlocking the secrets contained in this final and most difficult book of the Bible has never been easier with The End: A Study in the Book of Revelation audio series and study guide!
