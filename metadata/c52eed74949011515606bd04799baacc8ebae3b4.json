So, I decided to make it myself, like my mentor Daltony.\n\nHope you guys enjoy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c52eed74949011515606bd04799baacc8ebae3b4","amp;dn":"Paramore+-+MTV+Unplugged+%28MP3+320+kbps%29+REPACK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c52eed74949011515606bd04799baacc8ebae3b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,46,237,116,148,144,17,81,86,6,189,4,121,155,170,204,142,186,227,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
