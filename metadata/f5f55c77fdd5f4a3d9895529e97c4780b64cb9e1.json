The drug trade is a very profitable business of enormous proportions, stretching across the world from producer countries to consumer countries, of which the United States of America is the leader. The cost of the product is negligible, with profits far exceeding those of some of the greatest companies in modern times. The drug trade is a war being waged principally against the United States, where innovative methods and ever-shifting pitched battles are fought. This fascinating book tells, in alarming detail, the story of how the drug trade was started in earnest with the arrival of a mop-haired group of musicians known as the Beatles. The band was brought to the U.S. to go on concert tours, which acted as a magnet for teenagers and provided cover for the distribution of drugs that got a generation of young Americans hooked. Most Americans have only been exposed to the &quot;street pusher&quot; and know very little about the insidious, illicit trade being carried out in their country; a trade that has cost time and billions in health care and anti-drug police expenditures. The author rips the lid off the drug trade, from the opium growing poppy fields of Afghanistan to the desolate coast line at Maccra, Pakistan, to the British Bank of the Middle East in Dubai and beyond to the cocoa bush processing plants in Bolivia and Colombia, where the murderous M19 FARC guerillas, better armed than the Colombian military, run the country. This account is no soap opera, but real life in which the drug trade is playing an increasingly ugly and costly role of our treasure and finances. Drug War Against America should be read by every thinking person concerned about the welfare of his country. 205 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f55c77fdd5f4a3d9895529e97c4780b64cb9e1","amp;dn":"Coleman-Drug+War+Against+America%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f55c77fdd5f4a3d9895529e97c4780b64cb9e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,245,92,119,253,213,244,163,217,137,85,41,233,124,71,128,182,76,185,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
