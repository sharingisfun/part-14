Jeff Lindsay has brought more character to Dexter by giving us an idea of his family life; Rita's craziness, dealing with Astor and her braces and of course their new member, Lily Anne(in the series it's Harrison). As well as emotion and feelings? The rest of the cast is great with Vince at his best as well as his brother Brian who I'm starting to like. Of course there's a case, but I don't want to give it away. Reading this I swear I had Michael C Hall's killer dialogue in my head and Lindsay has reached the top of his skills giving us his best Dex book yet. Well thought out with a story that will keep you turning the pages. Don't pass this up, even if you disliked the last few or thought that they were a bit lackluster. It's so worth it. And oh yeah, Cyborg Doake's!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Double-Dexter-Novel-Jeff-Lindsay/dp/0385532377&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Double-Dexter-Novel-Jeff-Lindsay/dp/0385532377&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db8f69756d5f29e5b5fffb23bfeb4cb9146825a4","amp;dn":"Jeff+Lindsay-Double+Dexter%2Cmobi%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db8f69756d5f29e5b5fffb23bfeb4cb9146825a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,143,105,117,109,95,41,229,181,255,251,35,191,235,76,185,20,104,37,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
