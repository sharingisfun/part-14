Join me next week and again we'll countdown the forty most popular songs in the USA. Till then, keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nMichael Jackson sets a record by putting a sixth song (P.Y.T. [Pretty Young Thing] at number 10) from the same album (Thriller) into the top 10. This breaks the record set a few weeks ago of five songs in the top 10 from the same album (Thriller) set by Michael Jackson.\n\nCasey tells about the history of the first published blues song. It was written as a campaign song for the mayor of Memphis.\n\nSongs about types of men (like Rocket Man, Handy Man, or Nowhere Man) are constantly hitting the top 40. Casey lists the 15 that have made the top 10 and tells us about two that made it to number one; one by Rick Nelson and one by Sammy Davis Junior.\n\nTwo listeners write in with the same question: &quot;What song in all of chart history has hit the pop chart in the greatest number of versions?&quot; It's a song that Patti Page took to number one back in 1950 and later became the official song of our 15th state.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What recording act had the most top 40 hits before they got their first number one?&quot; Casey says this group had 25 top 40 hits before they finally hit the top.\n\n&quot;Cum On Feel The Noize&quot; by Quiet Riot (at number 5) is a remake by a band that once, was able to debut 3 consecutive singles at number one on the British singles chart. Casey explains.\n\nWriter producer Jim Steinman is responsible for three songs in this countdown, and Casey makes sure to tell us at every opportunity.\n\nBy the way, the four MP3's that make up the first hour of the show were taken from four different radio stations. That's a first!\n\nAlso, some of these songs reminded me that I had three hours of MTV from November, 1983.
