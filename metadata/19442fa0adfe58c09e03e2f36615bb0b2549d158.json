Whether passionately\nwriting and recording his own material or mesmerising audiences at his live\nshows one thing is abundantly clear: music is hard-wired to his DNA and flows\nfrom his fingertips like sonic bolts of lightning.  With over 86,000 albums\nsold, lashings of critical acclaim and years of high profile touring, ListerÃƒâ€ s\nresumÃƒÅ¡ speaks for itself and firmly secures his position as a leading light in\nthe resurgence of British blues-infused music.\n\nIn hindsight, it's clear Aynsley was born to be a musician.  As a child he was\nhypnotised by his dad's old guitar and at the age of eight was finally gifted\nhis very own.  The moment he held that first six-string the outcome was\ninevitable; he was going to be a guitarist.  Blessed with the coolest dad in\ntown, regularly spinning Hendrix, Cream, Fleetwood Mac and a whole host of\nbewitching blues for his spellbound son, Aynsley taught himself to play with\nrelentless dedication and a precociously attuned ear, spending hours copying\nhis\nfavourite records note for note.  Peter Green, Albert King, Clapton and Kossoff\nweren't just his heroes; they became his teachers.\n\nBlazing a trail in a bar band from the age of 13 honed his skills.  By 18 he'd\nstarted singing and had also formed his first group, during which time he\nlanded\na dream support slot with Buddy Guy and released two low key CD's featuring his\nearliest original material.  In 1998 those self-penned titles caught the\nattention of Ruf Records owner Thomas Ruf, who immediately signed Aynsley and\nhooked him up with Stevie Ray Vaughan's producer Jim Gaines.  With a maturity\nthat belied his years, the self titled debut announced Aynsley Lister as a\nmajor\nnew talent and kicked off a successful relationship with Ruf Records, releasing\n7 albums and 2 DVD's in ten years.  Their influence, coupled with his dynamite\nlive shows and intense touring schedule, earned high profile support slots with\nestablished artists like Walter Trout, John Mayall and Robert Cray, whilst\nrousing festival appearances alongside artists like the Fun Lovin' Criminals\ncemented his standing as an artist whose work, although rooted in blues,\ntranscended the genre with a fiery modern sound that was eagerly embraced by\nfans of rock, pop, soul and acoustic music alike.  In 2007 Aynsley was the only\nBritish artist to be named in Classic Rock magazine's &quot;Top 10 Contemporary\nBlues\nArtists&quot;, alongside John Mayer, Derek Trucks and Joe Bonamassa.\n\nIn 2008 Aynsley's huge crossover potential saw him sign to Manhaton Records,\nwhere he released the best two albums of his career to date.  Produced by Steve\nDarrel Smith and featuring Paul McCartney guitarist Robbie Macintosh, 2009's\n'Equilibrium' exposed Lister in his best ever form, throwing all his musical\ninfluences into a delicious melting pot that delivered sultry melodies, full\nthrottle hard rock riffage and introspective ballads.  'Equilibrium' received\nfantastic reviews and  stormed into Classic RockÃƒâ€ s Top 50 Albums of 2009.  The\nsubsequent tour saw Aynsley playing to sold out shows to over 16,000 people\nwhilst opening for the legendary Lynyrd Skynyrd, after which he and his band\nrelocated to the Tower Arts Centre and with the tape rolling, nailed a cracking\nrendition of their high-octane live set to produce the storming 'Tower\nSessions'\nrecord, which was consequently voted ÃƒÂ¦Best Live AlbumÃƒâ€  in the 2011 Blues\nMatters\nWriters Poll.\n\nWith his stock firmly in the ascendancy Aynsley is currently hard at work on\nhis\nnext record, intent on creating the finest album of his career.  He's wisely\nchosen to refine the material the best way he knows how; by playing it live.\nÃƒÂ´When you record songs in the studio and then go out and tour, they evolve and\ntake on a life of their own.  I want to capture that on the new record and want\na whole album of songs that translate to the live setting as well as being well\nwritten enough to engage the listener of an albumÃƒÂ¶.  The eagerly anticipated\nnew\nmaterial, slated for release in early 2013, will be distributed on his\nmanager's\nlabel as he's sagely decided to take control of his career by bringing\neverything in-house, following other successful artists who've cut out the\nrecord companies with astonishing results.  Needless to say, a tour in support\nof that album will surely follow, and that promises to be something special,\nnot\njust for the fans, but for the main man himself:\n\nÃƒÂ´Music is a release for me.  When I play I get lost in it and it's a very happy\nplace to beÃƒÂ¶  - Aynsley Lister\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19442fa0adfe58c09e03e2f36615bb0b2549d158","amp;dn":"Aynsley_Lister-Home-2013-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19442fa0adfe58c09e03e2f36615bb0b2549d158","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,68,47,160,173,254,88,192,158,3,226,243,102,21,187,11,37,73,209,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
