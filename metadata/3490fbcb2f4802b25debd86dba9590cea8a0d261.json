Granted they were laid-back and very easygoing, but they had some heft. The vocals of Chuck Negron, Danny Hutton, and Cory Wells were surprisingly soulful and the band that backed them was solid, and even rocked pretty hard on occasion. They didn't write songs -- it is true -- but their genius was picking songs. Along with producer Richard Podolor, the group found songs by writers like Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson, Laura Nyro, Hoyt Axton, Paul Williams, and John Hiatt and turned them into hits. So the group had laudable credentials, but more importantly, the songs collected here play like the soundtrack to the '70s. If you were just a casual fan, listening to Complete Hit Singles provides moment after moment of &quot;I didn't remember these guys did that song!&quot; exclamations. The hits just keep coming one after the other: &quot;Joy to the World,&quot; &quot;Celebrate,&quot; &quot;Shambala,&quot; &quot;Liar,&quot; &quot;An Old Fashioned Love Song,&quot; and &quot;Let Me Serenade You.&quot; Never sappy, never overbearing, always settled into a low-key, hooky groove, these songs are about as good as early-'70s pop gets. Another impressive thing about Three Dog Night is that they never showed any signs of slowing down. 1974's &quot;Play Something Sweet (Brickyard Blues)&quot; is just as good as &quot;Eli's Coming&quot; from 1969. The only thing that stopped them was the inevitable bout of creative differences that split the band up in 1976. This collection basically supplants the excellent Best of Three Dog Night from 1983. It boasts improved sound and one more song, their last Top 40 hit, &quot;Til the World Ends,&quot; from 1975. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tUniversal Music Japan\nCatalog:\t\tUICY 75562 - 75573\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nThree Dog Night (2013) [Japan UICY 75562]\n\nSuitable For Framing (2013) [Japan UICY 75563]\n\nCaptured Live At The Forum (2013) [Japan UICY 75564]\n\nIt Ain't Easy (2013) [Japan UICY 75565]\n\nNaturally (2013) [Japan UICY 75566]\n\nHarmony (2013) [Japan UICY 75567]\n\nSeven Separate Fools (2013) [Japan UICY 75568]\n\nAround The World (2013) [Japan UICY 75569]\n\nCyan (2013) [Japan UICY 75570]\n\nHard Labor (2013) [Japan UICY 75571]\n\nComing Down Your Way (2013) [Japan UICY 75572]\n\nAmerican Pastime (2013) [Japan UICY 75573]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3490fbcb2f4802b25debd86dba9590cea8a0d261","amp;dn":"Three+Dog+Night+-+12+SHM-CD%27s+%282013%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3490fbcb2f4802b25debd86dba9590cea8a0d261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,144,251,203,47,72,2,178,93,235,216,109,186,149,144,206,168,160,210,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
