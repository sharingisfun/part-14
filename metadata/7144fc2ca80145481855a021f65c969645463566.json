Includes a 18-pages booklet with extensive concert notes and photos. \n\nTwo shows which were previously unreleased in any form in a package that doesn`t leave anything to desire. This release could once belong to the best FTD soundboard releases ever ! \n  \n \n      \nConcert:   Both concerts are strong with great set lists. Elvis takes the Tulsa show a bit more serious with less talk in between songs whereas in Cleveland he seems more relaxed and being in a joking mood. Tulsa was tour opener 1974 by the way, Two excellent concerts which will find the way to my player not just once. Excellent job, FTD ! (Ciscoking) \n\nEnjoy!\n\nTCB,\nJeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7144fc2ca80145481855a021f65c969645463566","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Sold+out+-2cd-+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7144fc2ca80145481855a021f65c969645463566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,68,252,44,168,1,69,72,24,85,160,33,246,92,150,150,69,70,53,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
