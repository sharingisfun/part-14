Overseeing an octet made up of 2 trombones, tuba, clarinet, trumpet, bass and drums as well as his own tenor, Shepp pays homage to Duke Ellington and James Brown in his witty, colorful writing for brass/reeds and funky ensemble work (cf. the title track.) The extended free-form opening of the massive side-long &quot;A Portrait Of Robert Thompson (As A Young Man)&quot; leaves a slightly different impression however. Here Shepp enters the raucous free space previously occupied by Albert Ayler and Coltrane's ASCENSION. \n\nThe relentless hard blowing can be overwhelming so it is a relief when the gentler strains of Ellington's &quot;Prelude To A Kiss&quot; enter, followed by a comical but sharp version of &quot;The Break Strain-King Cotton&quot; march. Shepp had the best sense of humor of any modern jazz player and it is displayed brilliantly in the shifts and juxtapositions of &quot;Robert Thompson&quot; and the closing &quot;Basheer,&quot; a slightly less ambitious tone poem. The 20 bit re-mastering job allows Shepp's breathy, gritty tenor saxophone work to shine. \n\nTracklist\n1 &quot;A Portrait Of Robert Thompson:\n A. Prelude to a Kiss \n B.
