This thread has been followed even\n        to the deliberate poisoning of the gangster chief by the doctor when he  \n        learns of a hood- lum's blackmailing scheme.But in many respects it is an \n        outright gangster film with the medico's study of criminals as the excuse\n        for carefully diagraming the gang's operations. In addition, the feature \n        inculcates a bit of the sherlocking theme and modified romance.\n        Claire Trevor, the ace fence for the thieves, is the sole romance that \n        enters the doctor's life.Edward G. Robinson, in the role of the criminal \n        medico, is at his best. Humphrey Bogart's interpretation of the gangster \n        chief, whose jealousy of Clitterhouse eventually builds to the blackmail \n        scheme,is topflight.\n        Ronald Reagan's voice can be heard as a radio announcer, a job that Reagan\n        held  before he started as a film actor.\n\n\n\n\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029864/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029864/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n        lobby cards from: \n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://museum.walterfilm.com/thumbnails.php?album=16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://museum.walterfilm.com/thumbnails.php?album=16&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a110d7f598bb0a9a172bff53ed297676e24b1475","amp;dn":"++1938+The+Amazing+Dr.+Clitterhouse+Lee1001+Humphrey+Bogart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a110d7f598bb0a9a172bff53ed297676e24b1475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,16,215,245,152,187,10,154,23,43,255,83,237,41,118,118,226,75,20,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
