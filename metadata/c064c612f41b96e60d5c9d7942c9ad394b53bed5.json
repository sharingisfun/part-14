Jesus is a partner in the pain of the oppressed and the example of His life offers a solution to ending the descent into moral nihilism. Hatred does not empower--it decays. Only through self-love and love of one another can God's justice prevail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c064c612f41b96e60d5c9d7942c9ad394b53bed5","amp;dn":"Jesus+and+the+Disinherited","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c064c612f41b96e60d5c9d7942c9ad394b53bed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,100,198,18,244,27,150,230,13,92,157,121,66,201,173,57,75,83,190,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
