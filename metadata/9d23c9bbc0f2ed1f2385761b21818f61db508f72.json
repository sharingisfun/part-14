The songs were written by David Longstreth, the Dirty Projectors' lead singer, and inspired by Mount Wittenberg in California.\n\nI think it deserves a wider audience, so I'm posting it. However, please consider that this was a benefit album for the National Geographic Society Oceans Initiatives. 100% of the profits from the album go to this fund.\n\nI made a small donation and I encourage you to do the same if you download this. The purpose is to preserve vital habitats such as the coast off Mount Wittenberg, or, in Longstreth's words, &quot;so the oceans don't wind up like a giant poisonous corpse hugging the continents.&quot;\n\nHere is the link to donate:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://donate.nationalgeographic.org/SSLPage.aspx?pid=620&amp;srcid=312&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://donate.nationalgeographic.org/SSLPage.aspx?pid=620&amp;srcid=312&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere is a minimum of $5 (US). The band asks for $7 on the official site. I think this is reasonable.\n\n* * *\n\nThe album's official site:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mountwittenbergorca.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mountwittenbergorca.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* * *\n\nThe Songs (all mp3 at 320 kbps):\n\n1. &quot;Ocean&quot;  \n2. &quot;On and Ever Onward&quot;   \t\n3. &quot;When the World Comes to an End&quot;\n4. &quot;Beautiful Mother&quot;   \t\n5. &quot;Sharing Orb&quot;   \t\n6. &quot;No Embrace&quot; \n7. &quot;All We Are&quot;\n\n\n* * *\n\nPlease seed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d23c9bbc0f2ed1f2385761b21818f61db508f72","amp;dn":"Bjork+and+the+Dirty+Projectors-+Mount+Wittenberg+Orca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d23c9bbc0f2ed1f2385761b21818f61db508f72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,35,201,187,192,242,237,31,35,133,118,27,33,129,143,97,219,80,143,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
