Fever\n\nCover versions can be diluted affairs but Red Molly, a trio who were formed at a folk festival in 2004, have some serious pedigree. Their past version of Oh My Sweet Carolina (Ryan Adams), for instance, is memorable enough to challenge a brilliant original.\n\nFor their latest album, Light In The Sky, there has been a change of personnel. Founding member Carolann Solebello has been replaced by, aptly enough, a Molly. In this case the talented Molly Venter. The band were named after the Red Molly character in Richard Thompson's motorbike song 1952 Vincent Black Lightning.\n\nVenter has slotted straight in and the same crystalline vocals and beautiful harmonies are as striking on Light In The Sky as previous albums - something evident on the a Capella opener Dear Someone\n\nThe song choices by Venter, Laurie McAllister and Abbie Gardner are as interesting as ever. There is an inventive re-imagining of Robert Johnson's Come On In My Kitchen and they also cover Gillian Welch's By The Mark.\n\nGardner and her father Herb wrote the affecting ragtime-tinged Hello Goodbye and there is a flawless cover of Dolly Parton's Do I Ever Cross Your Mind - a version sung at just the right pace.\n\nThe darkest song is perhaps Does My Ring Burn Your Finger (Buddy and Julie Miller) but they also interpret Tim O'Brien's Walk Beside Me and the Doc Watson classic Your Long Journey.\n\nThere is a snappy bonus version of Fever and two songs written by the gifted Mark Erelli (&quot;not a household name, but he should be&quot; they say in the notes). They cover, quite beautifully, his mournful ballad Ghost, which has the trademark fine fiddle playing of Jake Amerding.\n\nRed Molly are red hot.\n\ncd rippped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ecb2f33d8fd51c0ed4f716c366325f7173ff4e5","amp;dn":"Red+Molly...Light+in+the+Sky%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ecb2f33d8fd51c0ed4f716c366325f7173ff4e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,203,47,51,216,253,81,192,237,79,113,108,54,99,37,247,23,63,244,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
