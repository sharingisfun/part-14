This is the story of one platoon in that distinguished battalion.\n \nAware of U.S. plans to withdraw from the country, knowing their efforts were only a footprint in the sand, the fifty Marines of 3rd Platoon fought in Sangin, the most dangerous district in all of Afghanistan. So heavy were the casualties that the Secretary of Defense offered to pull the Marines out. Instead, they pushed forward. Each Marine in 3rd Platoon patrolled two and a half miles a day for six monthsÃ¢â‚¬â€a total of one million stepsÃ¢â‚¬â€in search of a ghostlike enemy that struck without warning. Why did the Marines attack and attack, day after day?  \n \nEvery day brought a new skirmish. Each footfall might trigger an IED. Half the Marines in 3rd Platoon didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it intact to the end of the tour. One Million Steps is the story of the fifty brave men who faced these grim odds and refused to back down. Based on Bing WestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s embeds with 3rd Platoon, as well as on their handwritten log, this is a gripping gruntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-eye view of life on the front lines of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest war. Writing with a combat veteranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compassion for the fallen, West also offers a damning critique of the higher-ups who expected our warriors to act as nation-buildersÃ¢â‚¬â€and whose failed strategy put American lives at unnecessary risk.\n \nEach time a leader was struck down, another rose up to take his place. How does one man instill courage in another? What welded these men together as firmly as steel plates?\n \nThis remarkable book is the story of warriors caught between a maddening, unrealistic strategy and their unswerving commitment to the fight. Fearsome, inspiring, and poignant in its telling, One Million Steps is sure to become a classic, a unique and enduring testament to the American warrior spirit.\n \nPraise for One Million Steps\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[Bing] West is at his best describing the tactical decisions of small-unit leaders. The opening chapters give a heart-pounding portrayal of the battalionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brutal first month. . . . What makes these Marines so impressive is not that they are superhumans for whom danger and exhaustion are their natural habitat and killing a joy, but very young men for whom the prospect of walking 2.6 miles a day for six months over IED-riddled ground is no more appealing than it would be for anyone else. . . . Only two years after 3rd PlatoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final patrol there, the districtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s governor was proclaiming, Ã¢â‚¬ËœSangin is like an open space for the Taliban.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ If weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to do better in the future, stories like this need to be told.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Phil Klay, The Washington Post\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book is a searing read, but it is one that all Americans should undertake. We send our sons into battle, and few know what our warriors experience.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Gary Anderson, The Washington Times\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A moving account of bravery . . . Marine veteran West offers a suspenseful account of the perilous mission, during which the platoon suffered a greater than 50 percent casualty rate. . . . West demonstrates the tenacity and cohesion that kept this fighting force together and driven despite the horrendous conditions. The author gives a terrific overview of the Western attempt after 9/11 to expunge Al-Qaida, while the U.S. remained ostensibly to build a democratic nation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Kirkus Reviews\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“One Million Steps should be mandatory reading for every citizen who wants to understand the reality of the war we are in with those who would destroy our civilization and kill us. It is a stunning, sobering, and brilliantly written book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Newt Gingrich","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9966f65e1a50b1be27d2aeea3b54a8030e946722","amp;dn":"One+Million+Steps%3A+A+Marine+Platoon+at+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9966f65e1a50b1be27d2aeea3b54a8030e946722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,102,246,94,26,80,177,190,39,210,174,234,59,84,168,3,14,148,103,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
