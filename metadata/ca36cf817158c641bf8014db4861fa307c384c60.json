There she is reunited with her mother and sister\r\nPrim. While recuperating, she is introduced to President Alma Coin, the rebel\r\nleader, and is told that her actions in the arena sparked riots and strikes\r\nagainst the Capitol. Coin asks her to become the &quot;Mockingjay&quot;â€”the symbol of\r\nthe rebellionâ€”as part of their &quot;hearts and minds&quot; strategy. Katniss flatly\r\ndeclines, angrily reminding her that they left Peeta Mellark, her portrayed\r\nlover and fellow District 12 tribute, behind in the arena. Plutarch Heavensbee\r\nthe former Gamemaker, suggests she tour the ruins of District 12, which was\r\ncompletely leveled by a Capitol bombing campaign (with the exception of the\r\nhouses in the Victor's Village). After seeing how Peeta is being manipulated\r\nby Capitol state television to quell the rebellion, Katniss reluctantly agrees\r\nto become Coin's Mockingjay on condition that Peeta and the other captured\r\nvictors will be rescued and pardoned at the earliest opportunity. Also her\r\nsister, Prim, must be allowed to keep her cat.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $125,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $121,897,634 (USA) (21 November 2014)\r\nGross: $337,103,873 (USA) (13 March 2015)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/10258623549582751098.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/14319513271116436009.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/81000451870541220565.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/20756712341121337090.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/26227838919353464876.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/98099647166940697441.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951265/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 12.8 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 14.9 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 02:02:50\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: Atmos / TrueHD\r\nAudio Bit rate: 7719 Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossless\r\nBit rate mode Variable\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz / Bit depth 24 bits\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, Back: L R, LFE\r\nChannels: 8 channels 7.1\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca36cf817158c641bf8014db4861fa307c384c60","amp;dn":"Hunger+Games+Mockingjay+Part+1+-+%5B2014%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+TrueHD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca36cf817158c641bf8014db4861fa307c384c60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,54,207,129,113,88,198,65,191,128,20,219,72,97,250,48,124,56,76,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
