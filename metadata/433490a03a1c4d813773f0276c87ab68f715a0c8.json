Fairbanks\nEnglish | 2007 | ISBN: 1591025648 | 281 pages | EPUB | 1 MB\n\nSince the publication in 1859 of DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Origin of Species, debate over the theory of evolution has been continuous and often impassioned. In recent years, opponents of &quot;DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dangerous idea&quot; have mounted historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most sophisticated and generously funded attack, claiming that evolution is &quot;a theory in crisis.&quot; Ironically, these claims are being made at a time when the explosion of information from genome projects has revealed the most compelling and overwhelming evidence of evolution ever discovered. Much of the latest evidence of human evolution comes not from our genes, but from so-called &quot;junk DNA,&quot; leftover relics of our evolutionary history that make up the vast majority of our DNA.\nRelics of Eden explores this powerful DNA-based evidence of human evolution. The &quot;relics&quot; are the millions of functionally useless but scientifically informative remnants of our evolutionary ancestry trapped in the DNA of every person on the planet. For example, the analysis of the chimpanzee and Rhesus monkey genomes shows indisputable evidence of the human evolutionary relationship with other primates. Over 95 percent of our genome is identical with that of chimpanzees and we also have a good deal in common with other animal species.
