A torrent featuring the premiere brain damaged super-hero of the DC Universe!\n\nThis torrent contains the entire run of Guy Gardner/Guy Gardner: Warrior from DC Comics with art by Joe Staton and eventually Mitch Byrd. In my opinion the Warrior storyline and Byrd&amp;#039;s art made this series more than worth the price of admission.\n\nThis is an excellent part of history for both the Green Lantern books and The Justice League International/America era.\n\nI have also included the four issue mini series\nGuy Gardner: Reborn with art by Joe Staton.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the varied original sources from which I collected these files.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:771f31f6e10ad4d18bb87399ba02d893d52cca59","amp;dn":"Guy+Gardner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"771f31f6e10ad4d18bb87399ba02d893d52cca59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,31,49,246,225,10,212,209,139,184,115,153,186,2,216,147,213,44,202,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
