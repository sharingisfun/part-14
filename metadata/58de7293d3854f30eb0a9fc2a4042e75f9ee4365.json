It considered U.S. foreign policy and militarism historically and recently, centering on the IranÃ¢â‚¬â€œContra affair. It was harshly rebuked by conservatives and continuing into the 1990s was used by Republicans as a reason to threaten the funding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Moyers#The_Secret_Government:_The_Constitution_in_Crisis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Moyers#The_Secret_Government:_The_Constitution_in_Crisis&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRe-encode, re-upload, thanks OUL.  480x360 (360p) H.264 MP4  86:29 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58de7293d3854f30eb0a9fc2a4042e75f9ee4365","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Government-The+Constitution+in+Crisis+%5B1987%5D+Bill+Moy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58de7293d3854f30eb0a9fc2a4042e75f9ee4365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,222,114,147,211,133,79,48,235,10,159,194,164,4,46,117,249,238,67,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
