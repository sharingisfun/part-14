But Gray Neighbor just isn't\n   sure that is all life has to offer, and maybe there is more beyond the daily\n   sluice. But when a psychestryke horrorist attack brings carnage to his life, he\n   is thrust deeper into the edges of this utopian society and into conflict with\n   the agents of TRUST who keep order. Crafting whole new chunks of language, and\n   stunning concepts of a bizarre new world, Jamie Delano delivers a masterful new\n   series that has to been seen to be believed! &quot; \n\n  --  publisher's promotional description ( more at\n     &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.avatarpress.com/2007/12/jamie-delanos-narcopolis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.avatarpress.com/2007/12/jamie-delanos-narcopolis&lt;/a&gt;   )\n\n   I was quite impressed with this series. The premise is nothing special, really,\n   but the execution, featuring a combination of Newspeak-style dialogue (the author\n   doesn't entirely manage to keep it up towards the end as the pace quickens, but\n   it doesn't get so thin as to break suspension of disbelief and is a very solid\n   effort on the whole) and the eerily casual pornographic elements that keep\n   appearing in the artwork, establishes a surreal atmosphere which makes this work\n   hugely more effective all but a few of the other works exploring the same theme.\n\n\nContains:\n\n   Narcopolis (2008, 2013) (Digital-HR) (Empire)\n\n    ( compiled from the single-issue releases, and additionally bookended with full\n      sets of both regular and wrap covers, courtesy of the earlier Minutemen scans ) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7973d40262f7fe87016063bed0ff6e86a4d626b","amp;dn":"Narcopolis+%28%2B+Wrap+Variants%7CAvatar%7C2008%2F2013%7CDigital-HR%7CEmpire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7973d40262f7fe87016063bed0ff6e86a4d626b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,151,61,64,38,47,127,232,112,22,6,59,237,15,246,232,106,77,98,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
