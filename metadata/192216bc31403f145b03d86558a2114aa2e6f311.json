Millions of children tune in daily to watch Elmo, yet when Kevin walks down the street he is not recognized. Pivotal to the film is the exploration of Jim Henson's meteoric rise, and Kevin's ultimate achievement of his goal to become part of the Henson family of puppeteers. In addition to puppeteering Elmo, Mr. Clash is arguably the creative force behind today's Sesame Street, producing, directing and traveling around the globe training other puppeteers. Includes interviews with Frank Oz, Rosie O'Donnell, Whoopi Goldberg, Carroll Spinney, Joan Ganz Cooney, Marty Robinson, Fran Brill, and Bill Barretta.\n\nGeneral\n\n\nFormat: AVI\nFile Size: 1524.35 MiB\nDuration: 1h 16mn\nBitrate: 2 795 Kbps\nSubtitles: None\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nFormat: MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec: XviD\nBitrate: 2 595 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 29.970 fps\nScan Type: Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.289\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nResolution: 720x416\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nFormat: AC-3\nBitrate: 192 Kbps\nChannels: 2 channels\nSampling Rate: 48.0 KHz\nResolution: %Audio_Resolution\n\n\nScreen Shots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.aedes.us/d/ZKSgr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.aedes.us/d/ZKSgr.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:192216bc31403f145b03d86558a2114aa2e6f311","amp;dn":"Being+Elmo%3A+A+Puppeteers+Journey+2011+DVDSCR+XviD-NoGrp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"192216bc31403f145b03d86558a2114aa2e6f311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,34,22,188,49,64,63,20,91,3,216,101,88,162,17,74,162,230,243,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
