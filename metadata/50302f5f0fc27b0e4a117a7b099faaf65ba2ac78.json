Dylan's presence proved to be a huge influence on the Heartbreakers, turning them away from the well-intentioned but slick pretensions of Southern Accents and toward a loose, charmingly ramshackle roots rock that harked back to their roots yet exhibited the professional eclecticism they developed during the mid-'80s. All of this was on full display on Let Me Up (I've Had Enough), their simplest and best album since Hard Promises. Not to say that Let Me Up is a perfect album -- far from it, actually. Filled with loose ends, song fragments, and unvarnished productions, it's a defiantly messy album, and it's all the better for it, especially arriving on the heels of the well-groomed Accents. Apart from the (slightly dated) rant &quot;Jammin' Me'&quot; (co-written by Dylan, but you can't tell), there aren't any standouts on the record, but there's no filler either -- it's just simply a good collection of ballads (&quot;Runaway Trains&quot;), country-rockers (&quot;The Damage You've Done&quot;), pop/rock (&quot;All Mixed Up,&quot; &quot;Think About Me&quot;), and hard rockers (&quot;Let Me Up [I've Had Enough]&quot;). While that might not be enough to qualify Let Me Up as one of Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers' masterpieces, it is enough to qualify it as the most underrated record in their catalog.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50302f5f0fc27b0e4a117a7b099faaf65ba2ac78","amp;dn":"Tom+Petty+and+The+Heartbreakers+-+Let+Me+Up+%28I%27ve+Had+Enough%29+%5B1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50302f5f0fc27b0e4a117a7b099faaf65ba2ac78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,48,47,95,15,194,123,14,74,17,122,123,9,159,170,246,91,162,172,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
