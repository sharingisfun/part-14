Carus presents the Buddha's life in a collection of stories from his birth, attainment of enlightenment, teaching, to his death.\n\nWell written, it emulates the biblical style of the King Jame's Bible, occasionally puncuated with Ye, Thou, Thy, and so on. The stories are enjoyable but short and somewhat numerous. Also included is a glossary of terms and a concordance with passages in the New Testament.\n\nThe language and purpose of the book are dated, but it is a good introduction for people in the West, whose ideas of and exposure to religion may be limited to Judaism and Christianity. This book is readily available for download, but I believe this is the only version of it in Kindle format.\n\nPlease seed and share.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a3667035da9ba03c81ff2c609619f22bb2b4a58","amp;dn":"Buddha%3A+The+Gospel+%28MOBI+%2F+Kindle%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a3667035da9ba03c81ff2c609619f22bb2b4a58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,54,103,3,93,169,186,3,200,31,242,198,9,97,159,34,187,43,74,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
