ISBN 1-55690-432-0\n\n______________________________\n\nI'd actually recommend a rip from CD - for some reason I couldn't find one at the time.\nCheck out &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4663047&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4663047&lt;/a&gt;  \nThose versions might be a better recording than mine from cassette, even though it's 32kbps/11mHz. Thanks to captainelliotspencer.\n______________________________\n\nI could not find this recording in digital format (#searchfail?),\nso I converted my copy of this recording to MP3.\nFrom audio cassette (Nakamichi Dragon) to CD \n(Pioneer PDR-555RW) to MP3 (iTunes 8, 96kbps VBR).\n\nDolby NR was NOT used, so there is tape hiss.\nSome might say it's brighter without it, and \nmore muddled with it... you can post-process or\nequalize to your liking. I think I prefer it with \nDolby B enabled on the deck (as was done with my\nrecording of Catch-22).\n\nFrank Muller is (was), in my opinion, the best book\non tape reader, ever. Stephen King was quoted saying\n(something to the effect) that sometimes when he wrote, \nhe heard Frank Muller's voice reading it.\n(His reading of &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; is incredible. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4760916/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4760916/&lt;/a&gt; )\n\nThe back cover if this recording includes the quote:\n&quot;I've written a book and I hope Frank Muller will read it.\nHe will do such a fantastic job that the blind will see...&quot;\n--Stephen King\n\nThe novella was adapted for the screen in the film The Shawshank Redemption.\n\n\nCheers, FerraBit\nJanuary 2009\n\n\nLinks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth_and_Shawshank_Redemption&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth_and_Shawshank_Redemption&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Muller&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Muller&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3b49484bbd714c3cd2145a410e54526bc8b170a","amp;dn":"THE+SHAWSHANK+REDEMPTION+-+Stephen+King.+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3b49484bbd714c3cd2145a410e54526bc8b170a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,180,148,132,187,215,20,195,205,33,69,164,16,229,69,38,188,139,23,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
