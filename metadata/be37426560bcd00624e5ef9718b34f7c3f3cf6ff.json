Still, the right gentleman could provide the benefits of marriage without the tedious restrictions. And in Sir Sebastian Hadley-Attwater, renowned explorer and rogue, Veronica is sure she has found him.\nSebastian will come into his inheritance in a matter of weeksÃ¢â‚¬â€if his family deems him responsible enough. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no better way to prove his maturity than with a wife. But though Veronica will share his bed, she refuses to marry. However, Sebastian has a plan: An intimate sojourn at his new country house will surely change VeronicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind. For Sebastian never takes no for an answer. And he intends to persuade his Christmas mistress that they belong togetherÃ¢â‚¬â€in this, and every season to comeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBook #2 -- My Wicked Little Lies \nEvelyn Hadley-Attwater has it all--a genteel Victorian life replete with loving husband, ball gowns and elegant parties. No one, including the man she married, suspects that she was once &quot;Eve,&quot; a spy for England's most enigmatic intelligence agency. Summoned for one final assignment, the excitement of her former life and memories of her mysterious, flirtatious boss &quot;Sir&quot; prove too tempting. . .\nAdrian Hadley-Attwater is a respectable, dignified gentleman. But even the most proper gentlemen have secrets of their own. Secrets from the rest of the world, from their families, from their wives. Secrets that have a price. Now, as a veil of secrecy frays, a tantalizing game of cat and mouse will test the bounds of unfailing love. . .\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
