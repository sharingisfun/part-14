The title was: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhy came Hiram Abiff from abroadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. For the general public entitled 'The Future of Language'. \nThe quest begins with the ancient Hebrew, a language where the verb is central. David Bohm: Rheomode ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Wim van der Horst: Technomode. By Socrates, Plato and Aristotle who changed the Greek language, we come to Alexander the Great who practiced the last change in the Greek language learned from Aristotle, and therefore able to think logically. The rise of Alexandria, the decline of Athens and the development of the Latin language. \nAll this is a brain process. The virtual movement. The origin of language. \nThe 'language body'. \nCONSCIOUSNESS should be replaced by the verb 'TO CONSCIOUS'. \nThe future of language in the hands of a bunch of rebellious youth?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73433598e2ecde8fdc17226d7daef5e7964737ba","amp;dn":"The+Future+of+Language+-+Language%2C+Brain+and+Consciousness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73433598e2ecde8fdc17226d7daef5e7964737ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,67,53,152,226,236,222,143,220,23,34,109,125,174,245,231,150,71,55,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
