The album is a collaboration between Elton and Leon Russell,\nwith songs by Elton and Bernie Taupin; by Elton, Bernie and Leon; by Elton and\nLeon and by Leon alone.\n\nThe Union was recorded in Los Angeles earlier this year, with guest musicians\nincluding Brian Wilson, Booker T, Don Was and Neil Young. Cameron Crowe has\nfilmed the sessions for a documentary, creating too a moment of history as this\nis the first time that the genesis of Elton's music has been recorded on film.\nCritics who have had an early preview of the album are united in praise for the\nwork that Elton describes as a &quot;Seventies record with a modern feel.&quot;\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it?
