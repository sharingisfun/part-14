The film is based on a play by Ben Maddow and stars Glenn Ford, Janis Carter, Barry Sullivan, Edgar Buchanan and Karen Morley. It has also been released under the title: Paula.\n\nApparently convinced that the wages of sin are always the same and that crime never has paid off, Columbia has fashioned a workmanlike and fairly taut illustration of these axioms in &quot;Framed,&quot; For the melodrama, which came to the Globe on Saturday, elicits no sympathy for two of its principals, a cunning couple of connivers who seek to frame and kill an innocent drifter.\n\nBut while it develops no startingly-new thesisÃ¢â‚¬â€in fact it cannot escape comparison with two more-noted predecessorsÃ¢â‚¬â€the picture speaks its piece convincingly. &quot;Framed,&quot; in short, is not the best or most subtle offering of its kind to arrive from the Coast, but it is an unpretentious effort which manages to be realistic and absorbing, despite a set of sordid circumstances and characters.\n\nThe protagonists of &quot;Framed,&quot; as in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; and &quot;Double Indemnity,&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€that's the parallel which is inevitableÃ¢â‚¬â€a brassy blonde and a suavely ruthless gent, have concocted a scheme to abscond with $250,000 from the bank of which the gent is the vice president. Their plot demands a fall guy who will take the banker's place in an automobile &quot;accident.&quot;\n\nA mining engineer, out of work, who does not dislike his liquor, fits all the proportions neatly, and the lady uses her charms appropriately. At the climactic moment, however, the lady, seemingly by love for the handsome engineer, erases her erstwhile partner in crime. But her new and heretofore unsuspecting associate, now begins to suspect. And, from there on the lady's scheme fails to jell and the law, with the help of her boy friend, takes its course.\n\nGlenn Ford, as the man who is knocked about by outrageous fortune, makes a properly sullen scapegoat in this seamy adventure, while Janis Carter, who practices her cool, calculated deceptions on him, carries off acting honors with a hard and vivid characterization. Barry Sullivan, as the venal banker, is competent in a role which requires no more than a straight portrayal. Edgar Buchanan and Karen Morley handle the other short, featured assignments. And Ben Maddow, scenarist, and Richard Wallace, director, have joined forces to keep the yarn compact and moving at a brisk pace.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 860mb\nDuration.... 01:22:22\nCodec....
