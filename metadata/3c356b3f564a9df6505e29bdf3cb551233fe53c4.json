It has been designed for flight-sim enthusiasts who enjoy \nflying slower aircraft at low altitude; aircraft such as the Piper Cub, Drifter \nUltralight, Cessna 182 Skylane, all the way to helicopters and gliders. It has been \ndesigned for sim-pilots that enjoy an uncomplicated and non-procedural VFR flight \nover highly detailed, interesting and challenging terrain at low altitude.\nThe idea to make this add-on came from the desire to have scenery packed with lots \nof highly detailed objects and Ã¢â‚¬Å“eye-candyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which can be flown at very low altitude \nand still looks good. Scenery where you can enjoy a flight without preparing a flight \nplan in advance. Just hop into the aircraft, take off and cruise, and the scenery will \nbe all yours.
