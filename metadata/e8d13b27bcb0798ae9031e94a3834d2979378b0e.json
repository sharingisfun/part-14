But in the aftermath of the attacks, America awoke to some difficult truths about its longtime ally: for decades, Saudi wealth and charities supported individuals and organizations dedicated to doing America harm, and its universities and religious schools?known as madrassas?prepared countless young men for jihad against the West.\n\nToday, Saudi television broadcasts programs where children read poems against Jews and in praise of Islamic martyrs. Recently twenty-six Saudi clerics, among them, Sheikh Nasser al-Omar, issued a fatwa, or edict, encouraging Muslims to fight the Americans in Iraq. And in December 2004, gunmen attacked the American consulate in Jeddah.\n\n&quot;Investigating the history of U.S.-Saudi relations, it quickly becomes clear that this is an alliance built on quicksand,&quot; says co-producer Martin Smith, who has reported from the region for previous FRONTLINE films including &quot;Saudi Time Bomb?&quot; and &quot;In Search of Al Qaeda.&quot;\n\nIt was Franklin Roosevelt, seen in rare archival footage conducting a top-secret World War II meeting with Saudi King Abd al-Aziz on board the USS Quincy, who established the basic principles behind the U.S.-Saudi alliance.\n\n&quot;America struck a pact with Saudi Arabia, and the deal was very simple,&quot; says Youssef Ibrahim, former Middle East bureau chief for The New York Times. &quot;You give us oil at cheap prices, and we will give you protection. This protection eventually evolved into an American hegemony over the entire Gulf region, that this was an American area of influence, and in return for this it shall be protected from all enemies.&quot;\n\nAs history shows, this agreement between Saudi Arabia&amp;#039;s royal family and the U.S government has been challenged time and again by Saudi Arabia&amp;#039;s fundamentalist Islamic population, who distrust American influence and intention and oppose America&amp;#039;s alliance with Israel.\n\nMore info: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saud/\n\nAVI File Details\n============================================================================\nName.........: PBS Frontline (Feb 2005) House Of Saud (DivX 1h55m) ConRes.avi\nFilesize.....: 643 MB (or 659,155 KB or 674,974,728 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:56:23 (209,295 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DX50/DIVX\nVideo Bitrate: 718 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-2 Layer 3 \nAudio Bitrate: 48 kb/s (24/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 640x480 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nRipper ......: p2P2p\n\nEnjoy! :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&lt;/a&gt; (Forums, Wiki, Blogs) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&lt;/a&gt; (Educational Tracker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8d13b27bcb0798ae9031e94a3834d2979378b0e","amp;dn":"PBS+Frontline+%28Feb+2005%29+House+Of+Saud+%28DivX+1h55m%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8d13b27bcb0798ae9031e94a3834d2979378b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,209,59,39,188,176,121,138,233,3,30,148,163,131,77,41,121,55,139,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
