The story looks at what \n\nhappens before and after (but not during) a botched jewelry store robbery organized by Joe Cabot (Lawrence \n\nTierney). Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and \n\nenjoys showing him the ropes. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. Mr. \n\nBlonde (Michael Madsen) has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for Cabot; he's grateful for the \n\nwork but isn't the same person he used to be. While Mr. Blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are \n\nsurprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and Mr. Pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. So who's the \n\nrat? What do they do about Mr. Blonde? And what do they do with Mr. Orange, who took a bullet in the gut and is \n\nslowly bleeding to death? Reservoir Dogs jumps back and forth between pre- and post-robbery events, \n\noccasionally putting the narrative on pause to let the characters discuss such topics as the relative importance of \n\ntipping, who starred in Get Christie Love!, and what to do when you enter a men's room full of cops carrying a \n\nbriefcase full of marijuana. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Reservoir Dogs 720p-FLAWL3SS.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format profile : OpenDML\n      File size : 2.05 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 39mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 968 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 39mn\n      Bit rate : 2 508 Kbps\n      Width : 1 280 pixels\n      Height : 544 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.150\n      Stream size : 1.74 GiB (84%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 39mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 318 MiB (15%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, french, Spanish, Italian ans Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2d5f57d761d9359d746c6f0b678a7c1e8524ae","amp;dn":"Reservoir.Dogs.1992.720.BRRip.XviD.AC3-FLAWL3SS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2d5f57d761d9359d746c6f0b678a7c1e8524ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,45,95,87,215,97,217,53,157,116,108,111,11,103,138,124,30,133,36,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
