ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦tis byrjun was recorded between the summer of 1998 to the spring of 1999 with producer Ken Thomas, and became Sigur RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s' breakthrough album, both critically and commercially. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦tis byrjun represented a substantial departure from the band's previous album Von, with that album's Cocteau Twins-esque dream pop and extended ambient soundscapes replaced by JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nsi Birgisson's now signature cello-bowed guitarwork and lush orchestration (using a double string octet amongst other orchestral elements).\n\nWhile released to little fanfare, the album quickly gained radio exposure in Iceland, and spent the autumn of 1999 climbing the Icelandic album charts, finally resting at the top of the charts for a number of weeks. After surprising success in Iceland, the album subsequently gained strong international buzz with numerous articles in many prominent publications, hype from internet message boards and blogs, as well as often exuberant critical praise. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦tis byrjun was released in the United Kingdom in 2000, and in the North American market in 2001 by FatCat Records. In 2001, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦tis byrjun won the inaugural Shortlist Music Prize, awarded to the best album that has sold under 500,000 copies in the United States during the previous year, by a panelist of noted musicians and tastemakers.\n\nThe ten songs on the album include some self-reference: the introduction contains backmasked parts from the title track, and the last song, &quot;Avalon&quot;, consists of an instrumental passage from &quot;StarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lfur&quot; slowed down four times. An acclaimed music video was made for ViÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°rar vel til loftÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sa. Their music has also been featured in soundtracks, &quot;StarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lfur&quot; was featured in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and Vanilla Sky among others.\n\nThe image on the cover of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦tis byrjun was drawn by Gotti BernhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ft.\n\nEvery track is sung in Icelandic except for &quot;Olsen Olsen&quot; which is sung in the nonsense language Hopelandic that was used exclusively in Sigur RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s's follow up ( ).\n\n\n\nTracklist\n---------\n\n1. &quot;Intro&quot;\n2. &quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot; [Sleepwalkers]\n3. &quot;StarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lfur&quot; [Staring Elf]\n4. &quot;Flugufrelsarinn&quot; [The Fly's Saviour]\n5. &quot;NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½ batterÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­&quot; [New Batteries]\n6. &quot;HjartaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â° hamast (bamm bamm bamm)&quot; [The Heart Pounds (Boom Boom Boom)]\n7. &quot;ViÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°rar vel til loftÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sa&quot; [Good Weather for Airstrikes]\n8. &quot;Olsen Olsen&quot;\n9. &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦tis byrjun&quot; [An Alright Start]\n10. &quot;Avalon&quot;\n\n\n-------------\n\nBe a good pirate, seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a21b1290e61927bda6a2ea648ee944a43f1993c","amp;dn":"Sigur+R%C3%83%C2%B3s+-+%C3%83%C2%81g%C3%83%C2%A6tis+Byrjun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a21b1290e61927bda6a2ea648ee944a43f1993c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,33,177,41,14,97,146,123,218,106,46,166,72,238,148,74,67,241,153,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
