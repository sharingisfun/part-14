The first single, &quot;Luv Letter&quot;, is an homage to Teena's Motown roots, with nods to Stevie Wonder's &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours&quot;, and a dedication to Alia's father, who just happened to be a postman, like in the Marvelettes' song of the same name.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be4c71427ec70a17b9f535468755201fe5a9981e","amp;dn":"TEENA+MARIE+-+Beautiful+%282013%29+Album++MP3+%40+320+Kbps++WEB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be4c71427ec70a17b9f535468755201fe5a9981e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,76,113,66,126,199,10,23,185,245,53,70,135,85,32,31,229,169,152,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
