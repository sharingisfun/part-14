The bulk of the novel is a gripping man-on-the-run sequence relayed in terse, masterful prose as Moss, who&amp;#039;s taken the money, tries to evade Wells, an ex?Special Forces agent employed by a powerful cartel, and Chigurh, an icy psychopathic murderer armed with a cattle gun and a dangerous philosophy of justice. Also concerned about Moss&amp;#039;s whereabouts is Sheriff Bell, an aging lawman struggling with his sense that there&amp;#039;s a new breed of man (embodied in Chigurh) whose destructive power he simply cannot match. In a series of thoughtful first-person passages interspersed throughout, Sheriff Bell laments the changing world, wrestles with an uncomfortable memory from his service in WWII and?a soft ray of light in a book so steeped in bloodshed?rejoices in the great good fortune of his marriage. While the action of the novel thrills, it&amp;#039;s the sensitivity and wisdom of Sheriff Bell that makes the book a profound meditation on the battle between good and evil and the roles choice and chance play in the shaping of a life.\n\nBitrate....64kbps\nRead by Tom Stechschulte\n------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YUOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c6e4e2a9b2c3ba69a2259d2ffe1b01edfa2e923","amp;dn":"+No+Country+For+Old+Men+-+Audiobook+%5BUnabridged%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c6e4e2a9b2c3ba69a2259d2ffe1b01edfa2e923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,110,78,42,155,44,59,166,154,34,89,210,255,225,176,30,223,162,233,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
