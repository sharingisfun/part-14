The top-selling golf game for Windows is better than ever, with a lightning-fast Windows game engine, superior graphics, and a realistic feel from the texture of the fairways to the birds singing in the trees. The sweet spot feels a mile wide as you connect. Beautiful. The dramatic look and feel of Microsoft Golf version 3.0 is just the start: it runs faster, plays easier, and feels more realistic than ever. And with play this true-to-life from the tee-off down to the pin, you&amp;#039;ll concentrate on your game instead of ours. Escaping tough shots unscathed would be difficult enough without Golf 3.0&amp;#039;s improved control features. But when you add a little competition via the Multiplayer feature - or one of the tough new computer opponents - those stance, club, and swing adjustments may just make the difference. It all shows up on the scorecard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aa0e3f9379bce4b9a1206b9473f8fc64aef3ceb","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Golf+3.0+with+serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aa0e3f9379bce4b9a1206b9473f8fc64aef3ceb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,160,227,249,55,155,206,75,154,18,6,185,71,63,143,198,74,239,60,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
