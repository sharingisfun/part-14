Forced into exile while his friends strive to clear his name, Bishop and his family encounter the best and worst mankind has to offer while they travel the badlands. The human animal is trying to regroup, striving to fill the vacuum in leadership left after the collapse and form productive societies. \nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not easy. The lack of basic necessities has weakened the resolve of many, allowing age-old tendencies to cloud the minds of men. Those that do step up and take the helm of governance may have alternative motives and hidden agendas. \nFollow the adventures of Bishop, Terri, and Hunter as they seek refuge, trying to survive while their friends uncover the truth and keep the Alliance whole. \n\nGenre: Adventure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77cc2426be6b1c1846365c37373765ec733ea8de","amp;dn":"Joe+Nobody+-+Holding+Their+Own+VII-+Phoenix+Star+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77cc2426be6b1c1846365c37373765ec733ea8de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,204,36,38,190,107,28,24,70,54,92,55,55,55,101,236,115,62,168,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
