Team? Probably not, going on Proof of Youth, the second album from Brighton&amp;#039;s brightest pop experimentalists. As on its predecessor, 2004&amp;#039;s Thunder, Lightning, Strike, the eleven songs of Proof of Youth burst out your speakers like tangy pop bubblegum, but on closer inspection, suggest a broader, braver web of influences; many bands can remind you of the chirpy soul singalongs of The Jackson 5, the metallic guitar clang of Sonic Youth, or the cut-and-paste sonic collages of Public Enemy&amp;#039;s The Bomb Squad, but only one can do it in a single song. &quot;Grip Like a Vice&quot; and &quot;Titanic Vandalism&quot; prove The Go! Team template is present and correct, joyful melanges of car-chase horns, double dutch vocals, melodic guitar, and crowd-hyping rapping from MC/cheerleader Ninja. But there&amp;#039;s more here than formula. &quot;My World&quot; is a simple, pretty interlude of acoustic guitar, shaker, and synthesiser straight from some Look Around You-style 1980s science show, &quot;I Never Needed It Now So Much&quot; is a naÃƒÂ¯ve pop song featuring vocals from Solex, and the glorious &quot;Flashlight Fight&quot; is a Public Enemy pastiche that actually features Chuck D. Skill. --Louis Pattison\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. Grip Like a Vice\n2. Doing It Right\n3. My World\n4. Titanic Vandalism\n5. Fake ID\n6. Universal Speech\n7. Keys to the City\n8. The Wrath of Marcie\n9. I Never Needed It Now So Much\n10. Flashlight Fight\n11. Patricia&amp;#039;s Moving Picture\n\n\n\nWill be released on September 11 2007! (Nice date!)\n\n\nI know you have been waiting for this one. Please seed AT LEAST 150%!
