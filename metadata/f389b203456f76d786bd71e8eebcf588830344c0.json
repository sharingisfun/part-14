P. Lovecraft Ã¢â‚¬â€ was an American author of horror, fantasy and science fiction, especially the subgenre known as weird fiction.\n\nLovecraft's guiding aesthetic and philosophical principle was what he termed &quot;cosmicism&quot; or &quot;cosmic horror&quot;, the idea that life is incomprehensible to human minds and that the universe is fundamentally inimical to the interests of humankind. As such, his stories express a profound indifference to human beliefs and affairs. Lovecraft is best known for his Cthulhu Mythos story cycle and the Necronomicon, a fictional grimoire of magical rites and forbidden lore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f389b203456f76d786bd71e8eebcf588830344c0","amp;dn":"H.+P.+Lovecraft+ebooks+collection+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f389b203456f76d786bd71e8eebcf588830344c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,137,178,3,69,111,118,215,134,189,113,232,238,188,245,136,131,3,68,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
