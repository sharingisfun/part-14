Naturally, that speaks to the cozy comfort of the fit, but it also speaks to the craft: Hay may not tread new ground but his compositions are so simple and sturdily constructed theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re easy to take for granted. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s especially true on Gathering Mercury, which unfolds at an unhurried pace, the tempos never rushing, the dynamics never getting heated. Although itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a full production with electric guitars, pianos, backing voices, and drums, it leaves the impression of an intimate acoustic performance, partially because the songs are so casually lyrical in their description of the everyday. Hay doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make the kind of records that call attention to themselves -- theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re reflections of his offhand charm -- but a close listen to Gathering Mercury does reveal that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lot of thought behind what seems so easy.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/04/11/colin-hay/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c125d4f3b3186b78800618832a5e2e222279974c","amp;dn":"Colin+Hay...Gathering+Mercury%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c125d4f3b3186b78800618832a5e2e222279974c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,37,212,243,179,24,107,120,128,6,24,131,42,94,46,34,34,121,151,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
