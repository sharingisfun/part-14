But after countless years spent deciphering the language of the cosmos, the old man is losing himself to the many voices of the night sky.\n\nNow, a dark figure controls the forest with minions of kenku maraudersÃ¢â‚¬â€crowlike humanoids that menace Haven with violence and mayhem. If the Old Stargazer cannot or will not protect the villagers, they will have to find someone who can.\n\nNergei, an orphan raised by the warlock, knows they must venture beyond the safety of Haven to find the help they need. With little to offer mercenaries, and a ragged band at his side, he sets forth in search of heroes, never believing in what he might find.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1ed2706e60d75c9c2527fbbf5bead003059db7","amp;dn":"Last+Garrison%2C+The+-+Matthew+Beard.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1ed2706e60d75c9c2527fbbf5bead003059db7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,30,210,112,110,96,215,92,156,37,39,251,191,91,234,208,3,5,157,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
