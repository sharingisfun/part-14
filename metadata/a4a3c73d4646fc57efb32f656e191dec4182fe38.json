Fogerty has a rare distinction of being named on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists at No. 40 and the list of 100 Greatest Singers at No. 72. The songs &quot;Proud Mary&quot; and &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot; also rank amongst the Greatest Pop songs (&quot;Proud Mary,&quot; #41) and Guitar songs (&quot;Born on the Bayou,&quot; #53).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlue Moon Swamp is a 1997 album by American singer/songwriter John Fogerty featuring his newly written and published Southern rock/swamp rock music. Guest musicians for vocal backing, the Lonesome River Band, were invited to join in on &quot;Southern Streamline&quot; and &quot;Rambunctious Boy&quot;. Other vocal backing was provided by The Waters on &quot;Blueboy&quot; and The Fairfield Four on &quot;A Hundred and Ten in the Shade&quot;. Luis Conte accompanied on select songs as a guest percussionist.\n\nWhen asked about if the wet Fender guitar used on the cover was real, John said, &quot;Oh yes, it is a real photo. I bought a new Fender Stratocaster just for this occasion. After the shooting we dried every part of the guitar. Maybe I should put it on show now&quot;.\n\nIn 1998, Blue Moon Swamp won Best Rock Album at the 40th Grammy Awards.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Fogerty: vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, lap steel guitar, dobro, bouzouki, mandolin, sitar, organ, tambourine\n\nDonald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, Howie Epstein, John Clayton, Michael Rhodes, Phil Chen, Bob Glaub: bass\n\nKenny Aronoff: drums, percussion\n\nChester Thompson, Vinnie Colaiuta, Eddie Bayers, Jeff Donavan, Chad Smith: drums\n\nLuis Conte: claves, maracas, tambourine, percussion\n\nThe Lonesome River Band: backing vocals (on &quot;Southern Streamline&quot; and &quot;Rambunctious Boy&quot;)\n\nThe Waters: backing vocals (on &quot;Blueboy&quot;)\n\nThe Fairfield Four: backing vocals (on &quot;A Hundred and Ten in the The Shade&quot;)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4a3c73d4646fc57efb32f656e191dec4182fe38","amp;dn":"John+Fogerty+-+Blue+Moon+Swamp+%5B1997%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4a3c73d4646fc57efb32f656e191dec4182fe38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,163,199,61,70,70,252,87,239,179,47,101,110,25,29,236,65,130,254,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
