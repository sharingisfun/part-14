Dr. Hovind is himself a devout Christian, and shares the same Fundamental Doctrine as PCC, yet he makes a very compelling case for the avoidance of this particular institution.\n\nThis letter was very nearly lost; I salvaged it, reformatted it, and wrote a preface, but it is otherwise untouched. I have not edited Dr. Hovind's work in any way, and it is my belief that this represents an accurate copy of his work.\n\nTHIS VERSION HAS A MORE THOROUGH PREFACE. PLEASE SEED THIS VERSION, NOT THE FIRST.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:224e0ada2cbf08d6fbb1ec0822a90ca214dde549","amp;dn":"Kent+Hovind%26mdash%3B%26quot%3BI+do+not+recommend+PCC%26quot%3B+%282nd+versio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"224e0ada2cbf08d6fbb1ec0822a90ca214dde549","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,78,10,218,44,191,8,214,251,177,236,8,34,169,12,162,20,221,229,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
