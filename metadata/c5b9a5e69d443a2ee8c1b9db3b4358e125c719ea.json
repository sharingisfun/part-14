OVA released on September 26, 2008. \n\n\nLucky Star's story portrays the lives of several girls attending a Japanese high school named RyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ with a very loose sense of humor. The setting is mainly based on the city of Kasukabe in Saitama Prefecture. The main character is Konata Izumi, an athletic and intelligent girl who, despite these attributes, is not in a sports club and has to resort to all-nighter cramming for tests. Her laziness at school is due to her love for anime and video games and lack of interest in anything else. The serialization began with the four main characters in their first year of high school: Konata Izumi, Kagami Hiiragi, Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara. As the story progresses, they move on to their second and third years. However, the anime starts the story with them beginning their second year. The storyline usually includes numerous references to popular past and present manga and anime series.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck my other torrents for more fun xD\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬â€\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬â€\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬â€\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â£\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬â€\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬â€ \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â£ \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5b9a5e69d443a2ee8c1b9db3b4358e125c719ea","amp;dn":"Lucky+Star+24+episodes+%2B+1+OVA+Eng-sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5b9a5e69d443a2ee8c1b9db3b4358e125c719ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,185,165,230,157,68,58,46,232,193,185,219,59,67,88,225,37,199,25,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
