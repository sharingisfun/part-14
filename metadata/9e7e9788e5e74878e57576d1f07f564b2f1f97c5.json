But when he realized he was gay, those hopes were called into question. The Bible, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been taught, condemned gay relationships. \n\nFeeling the tension between his understanding of the Bible and the reality of his same-sex orientation, Vines devoted years of intensive research into what the Bible says about homosexuality. With care and precision, Vines asked questions such as: \n\n- Do biblical teachings on the marriage covenant preclude same-sex marriage or not? \n- How should we apply the teachings of Jesus to the gay debate? \n- What does the story of Sodom and Gomorrah really say about human relationships? \n- Can celibacy be a calling when it is mandated, not chosen? \n- What did Paul have in mind when he warned against same-sex relations? \n\nUnique in its affirmation of both an orthodox faith and sexual diversity, God and the Gay Christian is likely to spark heated debate, sincere soul searching, even widespread cultural change. Not only is it a compelling interpretation of key biblical texts about same-sex relations, it is also the story of a young man navigating relationships with his family, his hometown church, and the Christian church at large as he expresses what it means to be a faithful gay Christian.\n\n\nPraise for God and the Gay Christian\n\n&quot;For anyone who wants to know why some evangelicals find that the Bible does not condemn same-gender marriage, Matthew Vines's book answers the question. Christians who oppose gay marriage should consider what he has to say.&quot;\n- Tony Campolo, professor emeritus, Eastern University; co-author of Red Letter Christians\n\n&quot;Many people believe you can either hold a high view of Scripture or affirm gay relationships, but not both. Matthew Vines proves them wrong. Provocative and relentlessly Bible-focused, God and the Gay Christian offers hope and insight for Christians who have felt conflicted on matters of sexuality.&quot;\n- Justin Lee, author of Torn: Rescuing the Gospel from the Gays-vs.-Christians Debate\n\n&quot;A must-read for all Christians, but especially parents. Matthew Vines brings great insight and wisdom to the conversation so urgently needed by today's church. God and the Gay Christian has the information I was searching for when my son, Tyler Clementi, came out to me. This book will have a great impact on families, freeing parents of misunderstandings about their LGBT children while letting them hold securely to their faith.&quot;\n- Jane Clementi, co-founder of The Tyler Clementi Foundation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7e9788e5e74878e57576d1f07f564b2f1f97c5","amp;dn":"Matthew+Vines+-+God+and+the+Gay+Christian+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7e9788e5e74878e57576d1f07f564b2f1f97c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,126,151,136,229,231,72,120,229,117,118,209,240,127,86,75,47,31,151,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
