Twisted Nerve produced a flurry of protest amidst disability rights groups, even while the film was in its post production stages. \n\nHywel Bennett gives a spellbinding, disturbing performance as Georgie/Martin, a disturbed young man from a dysfunctional family. His brother is institutionalized with a mental handicap, his stepfather (Frank Finlay) loathes him and his doting mother (Phyllis Calvert) treats him like a toddler. Martin is a schizophrenic who adopts the charming personality of a six year old when he wants to win favor with those around him. However, he also has a dangerous alter-ego who cannot deal with his unrequited love for Susan Harper (played with considerable charm by Hayley Mills), a young woman whose attempts to assist Martin are misconstrued as a love interest. When he fails to win her over, he enacts a scheme that has devastating consequences. He begins to stalk Susan, then shows up at her mother's home and convinces her to take him in as a lodger. The mother, wonderfully played by Billie Whitelaw, has no idea of the horror her compassion is about to unleash......\n\nThis film is recently famous for providing Daryl Hannah's 'whistling theme' in Kill Bill: Vol 1. \n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 907mb\nDuration.... 01:41:49\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width.... 640\nFrame Height.... 464\nData Rate.... 992kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1709563381d2543414f967f1f337bd2878a6e24","amp;dn":"Twisted+Nerve+1968+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1709563381d2543414f967f1f337bd2878a6e24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,112,149,99,56,29,37,67,65,79,150,127,31,51,123,210,135,138,110,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
