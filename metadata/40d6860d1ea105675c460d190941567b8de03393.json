Visual \nStudio 2008 enables organizations of every size to rapidly create secure, manageable, \nand reliable applications that are optimized for Windows VistaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, SQL Server, the \nMicrosoft 2007 Office system and the Web.\n\nVisual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 continue MicrosoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \ninvestment in market leading development tools and developer platform. SP1 addresses \nissues that were found through a combination of customer and partner feedback, as well \nas internal testing. These service packs offer customers improvements in responsiveness, \nstability and performance. \n\nOverview\n\n.NET-based Windows application development benefits from increased Windows Presentation \nFoundation (WPF) designer performance and updated components for Visual Basic and Visual \nC++ (including a MFC-based Office 2007 Ribbon).  Web development improvements include \nenhanced the client-side script tooling (JavaScript IntelliSense). In addition to IDE \nperformance improvements SP1 fully supports SQL Server 2008 and the ADO.NET Entity Framework. \n\nThe .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1) delivers more controls, a streamlined setup, \nimproved start-up performance, and powerful new graphics features for client development \nand rich data scaffolding, improved AJAX support, and other improvements for Web development. \nAdditionally it introduces support for the ADO.NET Entity Framework and ADO.NET Data Services, \nwhich simplify data access code in applications by providing an extensible, conceptual model \nfor data from any data source and enabling this model to closely reflect business requirements.\n\nVisual Studio 2008 SP1 delivers: \n\nImproved WPF designers \nSQL Server 2008 support \nADO.NET Entity Designer \nVisual Basic and Visual C++ components and tools (including an MFC-based Office 2007 style \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“RibbonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) \nVisual Studio Team System Team Foundation Server (TFS) addresses customer feedback on version \ncontrol usability and performance, email integration with work item tracking and full support \nfor hosting on SQL Server 2008 \nRicher JavaScript support, enhanced AJAX and data tools, and Web site deployment improvements\nThe .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 delivers:\n\nPerformance increases between 20-45% for WPF-based applications ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ without having to change any \ncode \nWCF improvements that give developers more control over the way they access data and services \nStreamlined installation experience for client applications \nImprovements in the area of data platform, such as the ADO.NET Entity Framework, ADO.NET Data \nServices and support for SQL Server 2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new features\n\nAdditional Details\n\nWPF and visual designer improvements\n\nCold startup performance improvement ranging between 20-45% depending on application size \nwithout needing to modify any code.\n\nAdditional WPF support for text and graphics, and media to deliver better performance. For \nexample, effects like DropShadow and Blur were implemented using software rendering; with \nSP1 these are now implemented using hardware acceleration. Other examples include:\n\nText, especially when used in Visual and DrawingBrush, is substantially faster,\nScrolling improvements with Container Recycling, improved working set with TreeView virtualization\nA much improved WriteableBitmap that enables real-time bitmap updates from a software surface, \nDesigner support for the event tab within the property grid for control events, \nToolbox support within source mode.\n\n.NET Framework 3.5 SP1 Optimized Client Runtime\n\nSP1 provides a .NET Framework install version that is optimized for .NET-based client \napplications. The size of this optimized runtime is less than 28 MB.\n\nNew ADO.NET Data Features\n\nADO.NET Entity Framework\n\nThe ADO.NET Entity Framework is the next evolution of ADO.NET, raising the level of \nabstraction at which programmers work with data, and allowing the database structure or data \nsource to evolve without significant impact to the application code.\n\nRather than coding against rows and columns, the ADO.NET Entity Framework allows the definition \nof a higher-level Entity Data Model over your relational data, and allows developers to then \nprogram in terms of this model. Developers get to deal with the data in the shapes that make \nsense for the application, and those shapes are expressed in a richer vocabulary that includes \nconcepts like inheritance, complex types, and explicit relationships.\n\nUse LINQ to Entities with the Entity Framework for queries that help create easy to maintain \ncode that retrieves and works with strongly typed data objects or business entities.\n\nADO.NET Data Services\n\nThe Microsoft ADO.NET Data Services framework provides a first-class infrastructure for \ndeveloping the next wave of dynamic internet applications by enabling data to be exposed as \nREST-based data services that can be consumed by client applications (ASP.NET, AJAX, \nSilverlight) in corporate networks and across the internet. Easily build applications using \na comprehensive set of Microsoft .NET libraries and client components, accessing data through \nuniform URI syntax and using standard HTTP verbs to operate on the resource.\n\nADO.NET Data Services provides a framework to build data services for relational data sources, \nsuch as Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, DB2, and Oracle, using the built-in support for the ADO.NET \nEntity Framework, or for non-relational data sources using the pluggable provider model.\n\nTFS improvements\n\nA number of improvements have been made to Visual Studio Team System 2008 Team Foundation \nincluding:\n\nVersion Control\n\nSimplified the user experience through cleaner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAdd to Source ControlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ dialogs, drag and drop \nsupport to the Source Control Explorer and a much easier to use ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWorkspaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ dialog for working \nfolder mappings. \n\nVersion control now automatically supports non-solution controlled files. \nVarious changes to the Source Control Explorer such as a new checkin date/time display column, \nlocal path hyperlink support and en editable source location field.\n\nWork Item Tracking\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007 integration is now done using the standard Office ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRibbonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ delivering a \ncleaner and easier to use integration to the different Microsoft Office 2007 products. \n\nEmail integration for work items and links for Team system Web Access to make it easier to use \nemail as part of the development lifecycle.\n\nVisual SourceSafe migration tool\n\nThe migration tool has been dramatically improved through many performance and reliability \nimprovements. SP1 provides support for the elimination of namespace conflicts, automatic \nsolution rebinding, improves timestamp coherency and increases the amount of migration \nlogging information available.\n\nAdditional Features\n\nSupport for using SQL Server 2008 with Team Foundation Server. \nTeam System Web Access provides ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œliveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ links to work items and checkin emails. This improves \nthe customer experience for users who do not use Team Explorer. \nScripting support for the creation of Team Projects.\n\nPerformance and scalability\n\nWith SP1 a large part of the focus was to improve the performance and scalability of Team \nFoundation Server through changes such as faster synchronization with Active Directory, \nimproved checkin concurrency, a faster way to create source tree branches, online index \nrebuilding for less maintenance downtime and better support for very large checkin sets. \nImprovements in the number of projects a server can support that make not only the scalability \nof the server better but also the client experience when connecting to a server with a large \nnumber of projects on it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d6860d1ea105675c460d190941567b8de03393","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Visual+Studio+2008+Sp1+%5Bh33t%5D%5Bsuperl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40d6860d1ea105675c460d190941567b8de03393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,214,134,13,30,161,5,103,92,70,13,25,9,65,86,123,141,224,51,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
