The perfect family, looks, girls hanging on his every word, and the respect of most people in his town. But one thing was missing--a man to be his own. \n\nWhen Andrew Collins showed up in small town, conservative Sweet, Georgia, he looked more scrawny mutt than high school senior. Andrew's plan was to keep his head down and graduate high school, leaving his family behind to start his real life. \n\nWhen he meets Andrew, Jack thinks he's found heaven, but reality holds him in check until one night when his lips gently slide across Andrew's and fireworks go off. \n\nAs lust and something a little deeper brings them together, compelling them to take chances, people start to notice. Then the unthinkable happens, and Jack's parents find out he likes guys. The battle lines are drawn and they vow to pray the gay away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0761a1d6ccd96f7e9c20076f3af19c5c1d1ffeb","amp;dn":"Pray+The+Gay+Away+-+Sara+York+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0761a1d6ccd96f7e9c20076f3af19c5c1d1ffeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,118,26,29,108,205,150,247,233,194,0,118,243,175,25,197,193,209,255,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
