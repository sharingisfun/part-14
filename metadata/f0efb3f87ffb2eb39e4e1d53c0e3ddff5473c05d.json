PerkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ death was confirmed by his agent, Hugh Southard, who said the musician lost his life due to cardiac arrest at his home in Austin, Texas. His love for work was infinite and at this age he was active as a young horse while he registered his name as the oldest Grammy winner in February for Best Traditional Blues Album for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJoined at the Hip: Pinetop Perkins &amp; Willie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBig EyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Smith.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Perkins became the part of Muddy Waters band in 1969 and enjoyed great success with it.\n\nSouthard told the Associated Press, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe is the blues, he is the epitome of it. He lived it, breathed it. Two cheeseburgers, apple pie, a cigarette and a pretty girl was all he wanted.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Perkins along with other Muddy Waters former backing musicians that included Willie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBig EyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Smith, Jerry Portnoy, Louis Myers, and Calvin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFuzzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Jones came together and formed the Legendary Blues Band.

They did not appear until 1992, which is a shame. Perkins' trademark boogie-woogie riffs, rumbling rhythms, left-hand lines, and spinning phrases were in fine form. His accompaniment and supporting phrases behind guitarist/vocalist Luther Johnson Jr. are equally tasty and inviting. Johnson, as erratic a performer as any in contemporary blues, came ready to play and sing on this date. His vocals had plenty of grit, conviction, and energy, while his playing had no excesses and was delivered with zip and flair. ~ Ron Wynn\n\nTracklist\n1. Pinetop Is Just Top 6:15\n2.
