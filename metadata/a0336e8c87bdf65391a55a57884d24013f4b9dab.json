Labeled a new traditionalist, Travis delivered his songs simple and straight, and never leaned on a hat or a big belt buckle to drive his roots home. This set covers his biggest hits from his Warner Brothers years, and includes the elegant and calm &quot;If I Didn't Have You,&quot; the artful regret of &quot;1982,&quot; the lightly rocking and wryly humorous &quot;Before You Kill Us All,&quot; and the gentle, stripped down Western swing of &quot;Too Gone Too Long,&quot; among other highlights. A no-frills introduction to an artist who put a little down-home dignity back into country music. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] If I Didn't Have You\n[02] Honky Tonk Moon\n[03] On The Other Hand\n[04] 1982\n[05] No Place Like Home\n[06] Too Gone Too Long\n[07] Forever And Ever, Amen\n[08] Deeper Than The Holler\n[09] Good Intentions\n[10] Tonight We're Gonna Tear Down The Walls\n[11] He Walked On Water\n[12] Hard Rock Bottom Of Your Heart\n[13] Point Of Light\n[14] Wind In The Wire\n[15] Before You Kill Us All\n[16] This Is Me\n[17] It's Just A Matter Of Time\n[18] Diggin' Up Bones\n\t\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 01h:00m:19s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 360mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Country \nRelease Date\t&gt; 12 July 1995\nRecord Company\t&gt; Warner Bros\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.randytravis.com\n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Travis\n&gt; http://www.lyricsmania.com/randy_travis_lyrics.html\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/randytravis\n&gt;\n&gt;[Forever And Ever, Amen]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0336e8c87bdf65391a55a57884d24013f4b9dab","amp;dn":"%5B1995%5D+Forever+%26+Ever+%28Best+Of%29+-+Randy+Travis+%40+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0336e8c87bdf65391a55a57884d24013f4b9dab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,51,110,140,135,189,246,83,145,165,90,87,136,77,36,1,63,75,157,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
