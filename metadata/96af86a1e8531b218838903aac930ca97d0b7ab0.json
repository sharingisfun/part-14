It begins,\n\n&quot;If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably \nwant to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, \nand how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all \nthat David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into \nit, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores \nme, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages \napiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.&quot; \n\nHis constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers \nto phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the \nessence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.\n\n(I really enjoyed reading this book when I was at high school. I hope \nsomeone else out their like it too.)\n\n\n***** Sharing is caring, Please seed! *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96af86a1e8531b218838903aac930ca97d0b7ab0","amp;dn":"J++D++Salinger+-+The+Catcher+in+the+Rye.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96af86a1e8531b218838903aac930ca97d0b7ab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,175,134,161,232,83,27,33,136,56,144,58,172,147,12,169,125,11,122,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
