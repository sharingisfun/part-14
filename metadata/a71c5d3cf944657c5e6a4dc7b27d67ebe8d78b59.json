Milano was co-vocalist on Dead Forever while John Baxter was \n\nresponsible for Buffalo's heavy rock sound. By the time this recording came \n\nabout Baxter had left to be replaced by Bruce Cumming. (via midoztouch)\n\nAfter Buffalo some members went on to other projects. Peter Wells formed Rose \n\nTattoo &amp; had a distinguished solo career. Dave Tice went to the UK to join the \n\nCount Bishops &amp; around 1981 returned to Australia to continue touring &amp; \n\nrecording as a solo artist &amp; as a member of the Headhunters. He is currently \n\nplaying in the Dave Tice Band &amp; with ex AC/DC bassist Mark Evans as Tice &amp; \n\nEvans. (see http://www.davetice.com) John (Jack The Riffer) Baxter played with \n\nBoy Racer &amp; Southern Cross. Some material is believed to have been recorded but \n\nhas never seen a release. Alan Milano was also a member of Southern Cross after \n\nleaving Buffalo after Dead Forever... (Wikipedia)\n\n\nThis album is very rare and it took me ages to find a decent version of it. I performed the remaster primarily through Sound Forge Pro version 10. I did 'tops and tails' (the songs begin and end right on the money and fade-outs are clean), removed pops and crackle, equalised it a bit further using Sony Xpress Graphic EQ (this sured up low bass and ultra trebles). Finally, I ran it through Audacity and levelled each song to -0.2dB (so there are no clips). Notably, on songs like 'Jesse' and 'Games', I used noise reduction in intros and outros if they were very quiet parts and the 'needle noise' was noticeable. Final files are FLAC 24-bit @ 96kHz.\n\nCheers,\nMoofie Man","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71c5d3cf944657c5e6a4dc7b27d67ebe8d78b59","amp;dn":"Southern+Cross+%28debut+1976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71c5d3cf944657c5e6a4dc7b27d67ebe8d78b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,28,93,60,249,68,101,124,94,106,77,199,178,125,103,235,232,215,139,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
