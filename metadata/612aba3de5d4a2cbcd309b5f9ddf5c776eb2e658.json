The analog rig used to extract the sound from the grooves is near state-of-the-art, producing essentially none of the tracking distortion or surface noise normally associated with LPs. The sound is cleaner and more detailed than you may have thought possible in LP transcriptions. \n\nEquipment used for A/D conversion: \n\nLinn Akiva phono cartridge\nLinn Ekos SE tonearm\nLinn LP12/Lingo turntable\nAudioquest LeoPard tonearm cable\nPS Audio PS2 preamplifier\nKimber PBJ interconnect\nM-Audio Audiophile USB A/D converter\n\nThe mildest possible declicking (Click Repair, DeClick 1, DeCrackle off, wavelet method, pitch protection) was used to eliminate some of the more obvious ticks and pops. Other than that, there has been no noise reduction.\n\nThe following information is from The Annotated Robert Hunter Discography:\n\nJACK O' ROSES (1980)\n\nDark Star Records: DSLP8001\n\nArtwork: Trevor Wright; photograph: Roy Wilbraham\n\n&quot;Solo--Acoustic&quot;\n\nTracks:\n(All lyrics and music by Hunter except where noted)\n\n   1. &quot;Box of Rain&quot;: m: Lesh [says Garcia on record label]\n   2. &quot;Reuben and Cerise&quot;: m: Garcia [says Lesh on record label]\n   3. &quot;Talkin' Money Tree&quot;\n   4. &quot;Friend of the Devil&quot;: m: Garcia &amp; Dawson\n   5. &quot;Delia DeLyon and Stagger Lee&quot;: melody trad.\n   6. &quot;Lady of Carlisle&quot;: trad. arr.
