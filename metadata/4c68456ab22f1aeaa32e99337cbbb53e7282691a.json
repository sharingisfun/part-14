It is not a beta!\n\nThe game is NOT playable unless you purchase the game and get a authentication Key.\n\nThe upload is ment to save time on install for those of you who are running to the stores at 00:01. The installation takes about 1 hour and you need to have the necessary patches in the wow folder.
