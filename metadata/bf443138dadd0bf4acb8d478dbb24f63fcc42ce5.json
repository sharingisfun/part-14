This book presents a clear and comprehensive introduction to one of the truly fascinating topics in mathematics. Catalan numbers are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugene Charles Catalan (1814-1894), who &quot;discovered&quot; them in 1838, though he was not the first person to discover them. The great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1763) &quot;discovered&quot; them around 1756, but even before then and though his work was not known to the outside world, Chinese mathematician Antu Ming (1692?-1763) first discovered Catalan numbers about 1730. \n\nCatalan numbers can be used by teachers and professors to generate excitement among students for exploration and intellectual curiosity and to sharpen a variety of mathematical skills and tools, such as pattern recognition, conjecturing, proof-techniques, and problem-solving techniques. This book is not only intended for mathematicians but for a much larger audience, including high school students, math and science teachers, computer scientists, and those amateurs with a modicum of mathematical curiosity. An invaluable resource book, it contains an intriguing array of applications to computer science, abstract algebra, combinatorics, geometry, graph theory, chess, and World Series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf443138dadd0bf4acb8d478dbb24f63fcc42ce5","amp;dn":"Catalan+Numbers+with+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf443138dadd0bf4acb8d478dbb24f63fcc42ce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,68,49,56,218,221,11,244,172,184,212,120,219,178,79,99,252,196,44,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
