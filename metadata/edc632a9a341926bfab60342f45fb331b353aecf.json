WRONG! Men are actually very simple, easy to operate creatures. You just need to understand some basic truths about men and accept them. The nature of relationships between men and women have not changed since the beginning of time; they are just wrapped differently today. So in this book I gathered 8 powerful tips that will help you better understand men and have better chances in succeeding in your relationships with men.\nWhat inspired me to write this e-book was years of watching the mistakes that women make when dealing with men.
