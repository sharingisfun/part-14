Subsequently, they came across this recording that 'Trane arranged to record without the assistance (or interference) of Impulse!. Olatunji Concert: The Last Live Recording documents a live performance on April 23, 1967, one of the last times Coltrane would appear on stage, as he passed three months later. Strictly as a document, this is a rich and telling recording. It demonstrates his sonic blast free jazz direction that was becoming more aggressive and out of bounds; It portrays what could have been one of the most dynamically stellar groups of the mid-1960s avant jazz scene with Pharoah Sanders (who, in some ways, steals the show), Alice Coltrane, Rashied Ali, and Jimmy Garrison totally ripping it up; it also gives the average collector a taste of what the maniacal collector goes out of their way to find, as the sound quality is on the level of a sub-par bootleg. Don't expect to hear Bob Theil's warm production or one of Rudy Van Gelder's pristine live recordings ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ la Live at the Village Vanguard. Instead the equalization is uneven, and there are some parts where the tape drops out. Besides that though, this is essential for seasoned Coltrane listeners .(allmusic)\n\n1 Introduction [By Billy Taylor] (0:31)\n2 Ogunde (28:35)\n3 My Favorite Things (34:36)\n\nmp3 256k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88df7e9985c894a65e87d55f1c5a15dddac4cf9c","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+The+Olatunji+Concert+-+The+Last+Live+Recording","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88df7e9985c894a65e87d55f1c5a15dddac4cf9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,223,126,153,133,200,148,166,94,135,213,95,28,90,21,221,218,196,207,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
