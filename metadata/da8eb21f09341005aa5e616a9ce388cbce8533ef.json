Bush ascend to the highest office in the nation, what forces abetted his rise, andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½perhaps most importantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½have those forces really been vanquished by ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s election? Award-winning investigative journalist Russ Baker gives us the answers in Family of Secrets, a compelling and startling new take on the Bush dynasty and the shadowy elite that has quietly steered the American republic for the past half century and more. Baker shows how this network of figures in intelligence, the military, oil, and finance enabledÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and in turn benefited handsomely fromÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the BushesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perch at the highest levels of government. As Baker reveals, this deeply entrenched elite remains in power regardless of who sits in the Oval Office.\n\nFamily of Secrets offers countless disclosures that challenge the conventional accounts of such central events as the JFK assassination and Watergate. It includes an inside account of George W.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cynical religious conversion and the untold real background to the disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina. BakerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s narrative is gripping, sobering, and deeply sourced. It will change the way we understand not just the Bush years, but a half century of postwar historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the present.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING..\n\n&quot;LIVE AND LET LIVE&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da8eb21f09341005aa5e616a9ce388cbce8533ef","amp;dn":"Family+of+Secrets%3A+The+Bush+Dynasty%2C+America%5C%27s+Invisible+Govern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da8eb21f09341005aa5e616a9ce388cbce8533ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,142,178,31,9,52,16,5,170,94,97,106,156,227,136,203,206,133,51,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
