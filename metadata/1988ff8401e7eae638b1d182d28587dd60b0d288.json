Three complete albums and pieces of all the rest of the albums except two, Akeboshi rocket and Hoshizora logic. The complete albums I have here are Gensou Jihen, Literal World and Popsense.\n\nand considering this torrent is to save people trouble, Although it's also for my reference in case I complete it, here's a listed complete discography:\n\n    [2005.12.30] SUPERNOVA\n\n01 - Gin no Ishi ~opening~ (Ã©Å â‚¬Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¦â€žï¿½Ã¦â‚¬ï¿½; Intention of Silver)\n02 - Gin no Ishi (Ã©Å â‚¬Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¦â€žï¿½Ã¦â‚¬ï¿½; Intention of Silver)\n03 - splendid cherryblossom, bloom elegantly (Ã¥Â¤Â¢Ã£â€šË†Ã£â€šÅ Ã¥Â¹Â½Ã©â€ºâ€¦Ã£ï¿½Â«Ã¥â€™Â²Ã£ï¿½â€¹Ã£ï¿½â€ºÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Ã¥Â¢Â¨Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ£ï¿½Â®Ã¦Â¡Å“)\n04 - The theme of Arcueid (Ã£Æ’Â¡Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’â€ Ã£â€šÂ£Ã£Æ’â€“Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£Æ’Æ’Ã£Æ’â€°)\n05 - Ameiro Mastering Spark (Ã©â€ºÂ¨Ã¨â€°Â²Ã£Æ’Å¾Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£â€šÂ¿Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£Æ’â€˜Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£â€šÂ¯l Rain Coloured Mastering Spark)\n06 - Tsukito (Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¥â€¦Å½; The Moon Rabbit)\n07 - Taketori Hisho (Ã§Â«Â¹Ã¥ï¿½â€“Ã©Â£â€ºÃ§Â¿â€; Flying Bamboo)\n08 - Farewell\n09 - MIDNIGHTMAGIC \n\n    [2006.05.21] Akeboshi Rocket (Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¦ËœÅ¸Ã£Æ’Â­Ã£â€šÂ±Ã£Æ’Æ’Ã£Æ’Ë†; Morning Star Rockets)\n\nok, I had trouble finding info on this one.
