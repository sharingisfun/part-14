Yet interracial tensions and hostilities persist today as never before. Race by Dr. John R. Baker deals in an objective manner and informative way with the &quot;ethnic problem&quot;-what is meant by &quot;race,&quot; whether race can be related to intelligence, and whether or not one race can be considered &quot;superior&quot; to another. Written with a thoroughness uncharacteristic in the usual treatment of race, Race, is the only book that embraces history, biology, paleontology, the ancestry of man, his ascent to civilization, and the psychology of race. \n\n625 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press; First Edition edition (February 14, 1974)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0192129546\nISBN-13: 978-0192129543","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6aba5325a2622accea9336f9d00b7364ea24e27","amp;dn":"Race+%281974%29+by+John+Randal+Baker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6aba5325a2622accea9336f9d00b7364ea24e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,171,165,50,90,38,34,172,206,169,51,111,157,0,183,54,78,162,78,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
