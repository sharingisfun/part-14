Utilize the abilities of three different characters in order to complete levels by switching on the fly. Four teams of three characters: Team Sonic, Team Dark, Team Chaotix, and Team Rose race through specially designed levels that require logical character switching. Level designs promote replay value by adding multiple paths and missions. New Sonic story is told through cinematic pre-rendered movies between levels.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHEPURPLECUBE.ORG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d559be93c4d6e38132c35451a716700f78d7e5a3","amp;dn":"Sonic+Heroes+%28U%29+%5BTHEPURPLECUBE.ORG%5D+%5B+gamecube+%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d559be93c4d6e38132c35451a716700f78d7e5a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,89,190,147,196,214,227,129,50,195,84,81,167,22,112,15,120,215,229,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
