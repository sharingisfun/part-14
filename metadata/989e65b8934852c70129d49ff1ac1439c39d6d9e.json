He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs &quot;the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension&quot;.\n\nPS Little sampled down","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:989e65b8934852c70129d49ff1ac1439c39d6d9e","amp;dn":"Caspar+David+Friedrich+1774-1840+-+Paintings+%28Art+nrg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"989e65b8934852c70129d49ff1ac1439c39d6d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,158,101,184,147,72,82,199,1,41,212,159,241,172,20,57,195,157,109,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
