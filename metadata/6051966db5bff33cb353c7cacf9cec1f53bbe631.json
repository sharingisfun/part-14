It has often been pointed out that many Stax and Motown albums of the &amp;#039;60s had their share of filler -- nonetheless, others were full of gems that should have been released as singles. Reissued on CD in 1991, Knock on Wood is one of Eddie Floyd&amp;#039;s best albums. The soul shouter successfully embraced sleeker northern soul on other projects, but here he sticks to the type of raw, hard-edged Memphis soul that Stax was first known for. From the unforgettable title song (a number one R&amp;B hit) to covers of J.J. Jackson&amp;#039;s &quot;But It&amp;#039;s Alright,&quot; Jerry Butler&amp;#039;s &quot;I Stand Accused,&quot; and Wilson Pickett&amp;#039;s &quot;634-5789,&quot; this CD beautifully illustrates the splendor of down-home Southern R&amp;B.\n\n\n\n01.
