Set in modern-day India, it is the story of two compelling and achingly real women: Sera Dubash, an upper-middle-class Parsi housewife whose opulent surroundings hide the shame and disappointment of her abusive marriage, and Bhima, a stoic illiterate hardened by a life of despair and loss, who has worked in the Dubash household for more than twenty years. A powerful and perceptive literary masterwork, author Thrity Umrigar's extraordinary novel demonstrates how the lives of the rich and poor are intrinsically connected yet vastly removed from each other, and how the strong bonds of womanhood are eternally opposed by the divisions of class and culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1d69dd07b63b650a9f1dd850247b225297235c","amp;dn":"The+Space+Between+Us+-+Thrity+Umrigar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1d69dd07b63b650a9f1dd850247b225297235c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,29,105,221,7,182,59,101,10,159,29,216,80,36,123,34,82,151,35,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
