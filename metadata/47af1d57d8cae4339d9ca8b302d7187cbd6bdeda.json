A Christian &quot;C&quot; note sounds the same as a non-Christian note, but as a minister, God releases His Spirit and power through me and the music becomes a vehicle-of-salvation to carry God's love, healing and deliverance.&quot;\n\nAs a modern day &quot;David&quot; and often referred to as &quot;The Minstrel,&quot; Ben Tankard has a strong anointing to play under the unction of the Holy Spirit and has witnessed tumors melting, people being raised out of wheel chairs, deaf ears opened, and relationships mended in his concert-crusades.\n\nTankard states, &quot;signs and wonders must follow when a minstrel plays. We should expect debt cancellations and all other yokes to be destroyed and burdens lifted when our music is played.&quot;\n\nHe has won 9 Stellar Awards, 34 Stellar, 8 Dove, 3 Grammy nominations and is the best selling GospelJazz instrumentalist in the world.\n\nAlso a &quot;hit-maker&quot; producer, Ben discovered Yolanda Adams and has produced several top records for her, as well as collaborated with Take-6, Fred Hammond, John P. Kee, and others.\n\nTankard's 1997 hit song &quot;Git Yo Praize On,&quot; with his ensemble, Tribe Of Benjamin, has become the most used phrase among praise teams.\n\nAll this from a man who has never had one lesson!\n\nBlessings,\nTorrentTracts - October 2013\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47af1d57d8cae4339d9ca8b302d7187cbd6bdeda","amp;dn":"Ben+Tankard+Discography+1994-2012+%2811+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47af1d57d8cae4339d9ca8b302d7187cbd6bdeda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,175,29,87,216,202,228,51,157,156,168,179,2,215,24,124,189,107,222,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
