With this collection of country guitar and folk guitar books your playing will eventually drive nuts your Gf, family friends but youÃ‚Â´ll have fun for sure emulating your favorite country idols.\n\nThe books include all their respective audio files so u can check how far u are from the real thing. Nae worries, it could be worse: you could be sporting a nice mullet. \n These are the books:\n\nCountry:\n\n-Chicken Picking by Erik Halbik\n-Country Licks for Guitar by Steve Trovato\n-Country Riffs Vol. 1 and 2 by John Chappel\n\nBlues:\n\n-Guitar licks of the Texas blues heros \n\nFolk Guitar:\n\n-Frailing the guitar by Steve Baugham\n\nMisc books:\n\n-Licktionary (A collection of licks for every style. Very good. Will give ya a wide range of licks uÃ‚Â´ll never be able to use because no one will care anymore about your playing but who cares?)\n-Play acoustic (great book)\n-Telecaster masters by Arlen Roth. (lots of riffs of songs everyone knows. Lots of fun learning from it. Less fun when u realize u forgot them all just one week later.\n\nThe idea of learning from books is just to widen your palette but if u really wanna play trust in your ears and youÃ‚Â´ll reach beyond all this books. Remmember what mr Hendrix said when was asked how did he manage to play with his teeths:&quot; I donÃ‚Â´t play with my teeths, I play with my ears&quot;. Same as dumbo\n\nHave fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e046a1f59ec5df465b3f51a26ebc59e7723d90d0","amp;dn":"Country+guitar+and+Folk+guitar+books+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e046a1f59ec5df465b3f51a26ebc59e7723d90d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,70,161,245,158,197,223,70,91,63,81,162,110,188,89,231,114,61,144,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
