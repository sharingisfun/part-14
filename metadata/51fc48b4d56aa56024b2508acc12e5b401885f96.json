YOU ARE THE ONLY AND FIRST MASTER WITH A CHANCE TO WORK ON A PLANETARY SCALE, USING MODERN COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. DO YOU LIKE SCANDALS AS A MEANS OF PUBLICITY?\r\n\r\nA: Certainly.\r\n\r\n(Q:Is Sheela doing the job for the whole world which Eva Renzi did 1977 for Germany?\r\nA:She is doing for the whole world.)\r\n This question and answer are also missing in official transcription.\r\n\r\n To understand this question and Osho's short answer one should know what happened in sannyas movement 1977 in Germany.\r\n &quot;He's talking about the German actress Eva Renzi. The ashram thought it wise in 1977 to discontinue physical confrontations in therapy groups, such as the Encounter Group, after Eva Renzi went to German Stern magazine (I think) with an account of having been beaten.&quot;( thanks to comment of an elder sannyasin -Angela J.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: THIS IS THE FIRST COMMUNITY WITH A LOT OF FUN AND ENJOYMENT, AND BEING EVEN THE FASCIST FUN. IS FUN A BETTER DEVICE FOR TRANSFORMATION THAN SERIOUSNESS?\r\n\r\nA: Seriousness is sickness, it is not a device. It leads to death, not to eternal life...\r\n-and other criminal stories from Rajneeshpuram..at the end ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51fc48b4d56aa56024b2508acc12e5b401885f96","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Last+Testament_Vol-3+%2321_from+Germany","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51fc48b4d56aa56024b2508acc12e5b401885f96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,252,72,180,213,106,165,96,36,178,80,138,204,18,229,180,1,136,95,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
