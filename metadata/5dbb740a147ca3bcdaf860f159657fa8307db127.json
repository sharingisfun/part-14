Democracy Now!'s War and Peace Report provides the audience with access to people and perspectives rarely heard in the U.S.corporate-sponsored media, including independent and international journalists, ordinary people from around the world who are directly affected by U.S. foreign policy, grassroots leaders and peace activists, artists, academics and independent analysts. In addition, Democracy Now! hosts real debatesâ€“debates between people who substantially disagree, such as between the White House or the Pentagon spokespeople on the one hand, and grassroots activists on the other.\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now!\r\nWednesday, May 04, 2016\r\n\r\n&quot;Slickest Con Man Out of NYC&quot;: Donald Trump Set to Be GOP Nominee Despite Links to Organized Crime\r\n\r\n&quot;A Voice from Another Part of New York&quot;: Hear Juan GonzÃ¡lezâ€™s NY Journalism Hall of Fame Speech\r\n\r\nRevolutionary, Strike Leader &amp; Columnist: Juan GonzÃ¡lez Retires from NY Daily News After 29 Years\r\n\r\nSupport independent news! \nhttp://www.democracynow.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dbb740a147ca3bcdaf860f159657fa8307db127","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now%21+2016-05-04+-+Trump%2BMob+%2B+Juan+Gonzales+Retires","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dbb740a147ca3bcdaf860f159657fa8307db127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,187,116,10,20,124,163,188,218,248,96,241,89,101,127,168,48,125,177,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
