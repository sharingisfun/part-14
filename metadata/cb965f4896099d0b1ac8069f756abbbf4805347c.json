No further description necessary!\n\nThis fills a request by arrowgreen426. Enjoy 'em!\n\nThis is by no means every appearance of BV. Rather, I've tried to combine his first 8 comics appearances (well, 2 were black &amp; white comic magazines) with his other solo stories (MSH #1 and the Doctor Voodoo series) and the funny Fred Hembeck stuff.\n*Be sure to read the inside back cover of Fred Sells Marvel!\n**More BV appearances were in my torrent collections of New Avengers and Black Panther! A lot more. Bendis loves the guy.\n\n------\n\nThis torrent contains:\n\nSTRANGE TALES 169-173 (1973-1974) - BV's solo series that was cancelled, but wrapped up in ...\nTALES OF THE ZOMBIE 006 (1974) - black and white Marvel mag\nMARVEL TEAM-UP 024 (1974) - not even guest-starring a Spidey story will save BV ...\nTALES OF THE ZOMBIE 010 (1975) - ... but BV gets one more solo story\n\nFRED HEMBECK DESTROYS THE MARVEL UNIVERSE (1989) - not a BV appearance, just a bonus\nTHE SUPER-SPECIAL EXTRA UNRELEASED BONUSES (2003 or so) - ditto\nFRED HEMBECK SELLS THE MARVEL UNIVERSE (1990) - Sister Voodoo?
