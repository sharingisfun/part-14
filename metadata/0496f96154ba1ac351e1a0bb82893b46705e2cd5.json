With his instantly recognizable deep and distinctive gravelly voice, \nresembling the sound of a trumpet, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating \ngreat dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive \npurposes. He was also greatly skilled at scat singing, vocalizing using sounds and syllables \ninstead of actual lyrics.\n\n\n\n   1. Louis Armstrong - When It's Sleepy Time Down South      [02:43]\n   2.
