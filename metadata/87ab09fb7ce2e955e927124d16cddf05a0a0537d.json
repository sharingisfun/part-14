Recorded in Helsinki in 1993.\n\nDirected by Aki KaurismÃƒÂ¤ki\n\nMy notes\n\nWiki entries are available for the director and the band and its members and current works.  There is a fan cite as well which you can get through the wiki notes.  As the fan site says, Leningrad Cowboys are the best--  just look at the hair and shoes.  It put me a bit in mind of the recent film by Lukas Moodysson called &quot;We Are The Best&quot; and perhaps there is a connection-- who knows?\n\n\nTo give away either the musical numbers presented, the context,  or the visual excitement of this event would be a cheat.  Therefore I will not do it.\n\nThis concert is presented in the movies group for the file share simply because it is more of a documentary than music video.\n\nIn the early days of VHS rentals in the US I got my first experience of the Leningrad Cowboys from a supermarket.  It was just sitting there waiting patiently for me to find.  The title was &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America&quot;  and it was one of my first film reviews for the internet movie database when it was very young and still on Usenet.\n\nSince then it has been hard for me to track down other Leningrad Cowboys shows.  Aki KaurismÃƒÂ¤ki does not do this full time.  He is a Finnish film director with a large portfolio.\n\nEnjoy The Total Balalaika Show.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nFor those who are capable of mounting video for You Tube, I encourage this as well.  Currently some of the musical numbers have been posted individually.\n\nThis encode has hard subbed English subtitles which an earlier small size version lacks.  It required a number of tasks using free software.  This information is availalbe if you use your search engine and ask for video help.\n\nnotes written August 29th,  2014\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87ab09fb7ce2e955e927124d16cddf05a0a0537d","amp;dn":"The+Total+Balalaika+Show+%281994%29+starring+Leningrad+Cowboys+and+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87ab09fb7ce2e955e927124d16cddf05a0a0537d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,171,9,251,124,226,233,85,233,39,18,77,22,205,223,5,160,160,83,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
