He was assisted throughout the recording by a young multi-instrumentalist named Webb Burrel. He was somewhat enamored by the early Emitt Rhodes solo albums, and wanted to make the album in a similar fashion. Of course, it wasn't a completely solo effort, but he did use only a few musicians on the record, in direct contrast to his 60s productions. It stands in direct contrast to most of his work because it relies almost exclusively on outside songwriting.\n\n\nCurt Boettcher (January 7, 1944 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ June 14, 1987) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer from Wisconsin. He was a pivotal figure in the mid-1960s emergence of Sunshine pop, working with The Association, The Millennium, Sagittarius, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Tommy Roe, Elton John, Gene Clark (formerly of The Byrds), Emitt Rhodes, Tandyn Almer, and the Beach Boys, among others. Boettcher sang some background vocals on The Byrds' The Notorious Byrd Brothers album (which was produced by Gary Usher).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc023ae31cf696593a64b773a72182a839f6128a","amp;dn":"Curt+Boetcher+%26lrm%3B-+There%27s+An+Innocent+Face+%281973%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc023ae31cf696593a64b773a72182a839f6128a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,2,58,227,28,246,150,89,58,100,183,115,167,33,130,168,57,246,18,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
