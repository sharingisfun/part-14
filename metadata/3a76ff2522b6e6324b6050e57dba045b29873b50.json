The first locomotives to receive the new styling were the Baldwin DR-6-4-20, which was carried through subsequent Baldwin locomotives, including the RF-16. \n\nThe RF-16 quickly gained a reputation as a reliable and rugged locomotive with heavy pulling power. Many of the units saw service hauling coal drags, where these characteristics were put to best use. \n\nA total of 109 cab-equipped A units were built between November 1950 and May 1953, along with 51 cabless booster B units, for three main railroads - the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad. \n\nWithdrawals of the Class began in the early 1960s and by 1971, all but two of the units had been sold for scrap Ã¢â‚¬â€œ units 1205 and 1216 were to be scrapped in 1974, but were saved by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad for freight services until 1981. The two units have since reportedly been stored on the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad, inside a warehouse that is inaccessible to the public. \n\nThe Baldwin RF-16 Ã¢â‚¬ËœSharknoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for Train Simulator, from Digital Train Model, is available in Pennsylvania Railroad livery and features position lights, number board lights, cab and instrument lighting, engine room lights, opening cab doors and windows, and cab heater. Also included are a number of freight cars, including a 40ft Boxcar, 50ft Boxcar, 53ft Flatcar, Tank Car and Caboose","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a76ff2522b6e6324b6050e57dba045b29873b50","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+PRR+RF-16+%27Sharknose%27+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a76ff2522b6e6324b6050e57dba045b29873b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,118,255,37,34,182,230,50,75,96,80,229,125,186,4,91,41,135,59,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
