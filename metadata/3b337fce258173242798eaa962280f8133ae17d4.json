It is a very complex endeavor and its success depends on the effective interactions and organization of professionals in many different positions - scientists, chemical engineers, managers, attorneys, economists, and specialists. Developing An Industrial Chemical Process: An Integrated Approach is the first professional reference to examine the actual process development practices of industrial corporations, research organizations, engineering companies and universities. Backed by 45 years of experience within R&amp;D, design, and management positions in various countries, the author presents his know-how for better and faster results and fewer start-up problems. While most books on chemical processes concentrate only on the scientific/technical aspect, this book also deals with the range of people and &quot;real life&quot; issues involved.\n\nDeveloping An Industrial Chemical Process serves as a &quot;how to&quot; guide for the effective management of process development procedures. The issues start with the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; concerns of the executives and project managers and proceed with the actual implementation by professionals, each in his/her particular role. The author addresses the working organization and the different activities involved in a process development program, including the implementation, design, construction and start-up of a new plant. Finally, each chapter provides a short summary of the key issues along with suggestions for further reading. This book can help you handle the problems normally associated with the development and implementation of a new process and reduce the time and resources that you and your organization spend on this critical activity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b337fce258173242798eaa962280f8133ae17d4","amp;dn":"Developing+An+Industrial+Chemical+Process","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b337fce258173242798eaa962280f8133ae17d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,51,127,206,37,129,115,36,39,152,234,169,98,40,15,129,51,174,23,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
