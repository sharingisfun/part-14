It was released on Restless/Enigma Records, and licensed to Ace Records under Big Beat in the UK. It was recorded and mixed by Steve McMillan at Ocean Way, Hollywood between June 21-July 14, 1991. It was self-produced by Poison Ivy. Iggy Pop guested on the track &quot;Miniskirt Blues&quot;.\n\n\nReview for Allmusic.com\n\nby Steve Huey\n\nThe Cramps' humor has always relied on trashy tastelessness, but even at its most offensive, it is usually delivered with a wink, preventing it from degenerating into mindless vulgarity. Unfortunately, Look Mom No Head! doesn't do a good job of retaining this balance, as the flat performances and lack of intensity and energy fail to supply the irony necessary for the Cramps' music to work well. Sleaze without fun is simply embarrassing.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9671a758c989ad9017d35cdad6599d1b05d811","amp;dn":"The+Cramps+-+Look+Mom+No+Head%21+%5BBonus+Track%5D+320+bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9671a758c989ad9017d35cdad6599d1b05d811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,150,113,167,88,201,137,173,144,23,211,92,218,214,89,157,27,5,216,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
