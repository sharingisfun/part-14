But what can they do? They know nothing about the attack, so they plant The Afghan, a prisoner of Guantanamo Bay and a former commander of the Taliban.\n\nListening to THE AFGHAN is like watching a train wreck. You know it will be grotesque, that there will be bloodied bodies and hideous dismemberments, yet you can&amp;#039;t help yourself. Frederick Forsyth has the ability to mesmerize with an insider&amp;#039;s knowledge, and Steven Crossley&amp;#039;s reading is no less insistent. British and American intelligence learn that Al-Qaeda is planning something big. Will it be nuclear? Biological? No one is sure. Someone has to infiltrate, a nearly impossible task. Nearly. British intelligence officer Mike Martin is the man for the job. Crossley&amp;#039;s performance as an assortment of Brits, Americans, Arabs, Afghans, and Indians is flawless, and Forsyth&amp;#039;s story of imminent disaster is irresistible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06689ab8e762ada080d38dbe05c48a82f4492985","amp;dn":"Frederick+Forsyth+-+The+Afghan+%28audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06689ab8e762ada080d38dbe05c48a82f4492985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,104,154,184,231,98,173,160,128,211,141,190,5,196,138,130,244,73,41,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
