Lemke, Victoria F. Roche, Sandy W. Zito.\n\n\n# ISBN-13: 9781608310166 \n# Publisher: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins\n# Publication year: 2011\n# Edition number: 5\n# Pages: 208\n\n\nOverview\n========\n\nWith its  Student Workbook CD-ROM and  new case studies, the  Fifth Edition of\nthis  acclaimed self-paced  review enables  you to  master the  principles and\napplications of organic  functional groups. Moreover, it prepares  you for the\nrequired  pharmacy  courses  in  medicinal chemistry  by  thoroughly  covering\nnomenclature, physical properties, chemical properties, and metabolism.\n\nAs you  progress through  the text,  you'll develop  such important  skills as\ndrawing chemical structures and  predicting the solubility, instabilities, and\nmetabolism of each organic functional group.\n\n\nContents\n========\n\n  1   Water Solubility and Chemical Bonding \n  2   Alkanes (CnH2n+2)\n  3   Alkenes (CnH2n)\n  4   Aromatic Hydrocarbons\n  5   Haolgenated Hydrocarbons\n  6   Alcohols\n  7   Phenols\n  8   Ethers and Thioethers\n  9   Aldehydes and Ketones\n  10  Amines\n  11  Carboxylic Acids\n  12  Functional Derivatives of Carboxylic Acids\n  13  Sulfonic Acids and Sulfonamides\n  14  Nitrogen Functional Groups\n  15  Heterocycles\n  16  Oligonucleotides and Nucleic Acids\n  17  Proteins\n  18  Predicting Water Solubility\n   A  Steroisomerism-Asymmetric Molecules\n   B  Acidity and Basicity\n   C  Drug Metabolism\n   D  Learning Objectives\n      Index\n\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nThomas L. Lemke -  BS Pharmacy from the University of  Wisconsin followed by a\nPhD in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Kansas.\n\nRetired from the  University of Houston, College of Pharmacy  in 2006 after 36\nyears on the faculty.\n\nHas held  part time appointment at  Loma Linda College of  Pharmacy, Texas A&amp;M\nCollege of Pharmacy, and the University  of Hawaii - Hilo College of Pharmacy.\nTeaching  responsibilities have  been  in medicinal  chemistry  and a  general\nscience  core elective  on drugs  in society.  Administrative responsibilities\nhave included  admissions into  the pharmacy professional  program, curricular\nassessment, and management of the pharmacy professional program.\n\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f152635eb2cec63079b0dcd98d2aaa1c04f95fc","amp;dn":"Review+of+Organic+Functional+Groups+-+Thomas+L.+Lemke%2C+5e+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f152635eb2cec63079b0dcd98d2aaa1c04f95fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,21,38,53,235,44,236,99,7,155,13,205,152,210,170,161,192,79,149,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
