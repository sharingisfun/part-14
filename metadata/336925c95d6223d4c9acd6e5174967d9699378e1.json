If you're not familiar with the impOSCar then you're in for  a \n   real treat.  However, if  you fell  in love  with it  first time around, be \n   prepared to fall in love all over again.  \n             \n   ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because, while  the original impOSCar  was a component  emulation of \n   the rare and classic OSCar synthesizer with a few added bells and whistles, \n   such  as  polyphony and  on-board  effects, impOSCar2  soars  to new  sonic \n   heights via  steroid injections  of innovative  features and  enhancements, \n   each  designed  around  the  wishes  of  those  musicians,  programmers and \n   producers who loved the original. \n             \n   Since the original impOSCar release we've carefully compiled user  feedback \n   and over the  course of eighteen  months, in another  true labour of  love, \n   we've incorporated the best of these within impOSCar2 creating a synth that \n   positively oozes more character, more playability, more expression and more \n   detailed sound sculpting opportunities than could have been imagined a  few \n   years ago.  \n             \n             \n   Compatibility: \n             \n             \n   (WIN) Standalone,VST &gt; 32bit \n\n Key Features: \n             \n             \n   Successor to the multi-award winning impOSCar \n             \n   Two Oscillators &amp; 13 Waveforms \n             \n   New Mono Unison and Poly Unison Modes \n             \n   New Aux Mod Section with comprehensive routing \n             \n   Programmable Additive Wave Matrix Grid \n             \n   Nine Filter Types with Drive, Cutoff, Q and Separation. \n             \n   New Chord Memory and single note retrigger \n             \n   6 Portamento modes with new Unison glide voice spread \n             \n   New Unison Voice Pan \n             \n   New Note Pan Modes \n             \n   Programmable Velocity Responses and New Aftertouch \n             \n   Improved Arpeggiator \n             \n   New Instrument and Effects Versions \n             \n   Small, Regular or Large Interface Sizes \n             \n   New Ring Modulator \n             \n   New Chorus Modes \n             \n   1000+ Patch library featuring sounds created by \n             \n   original OSCar users inc Billy Currie (Ultravox) \n             \n   Darren Price &amp; Rick Smith (Underworld) &amp; Paul Wiffen \n             \n   (the original OSCar sound designer and programmer \n             \n   for Stevie Wonder &amp; Jean Michel Jarre). \n\n1) Unzip, Unrar and install \n                            \n                  2) Run plugin, click on buy a license \n                     and use keygen to register \n                            \n                  3) Have fun! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:336925c95d6223d4c9acd6e5174967d9699378e1","amp;dn":"GForce.Software.ImpOSCar2.v2.0.0.1245.WIN.Incl.Keygen+by+CHRISJE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"336925c95d6223d4c9acd6e5174967d9699378e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,105,37,201,93,98,35,212,201,172,214,229,23,73,103,217,105,147,120,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
