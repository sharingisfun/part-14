The song was featured in the Beatles' 1967 television film Magical Mystery Tour, as a track on the associated British double EP of the same name and its American counterpart LP, and was the B-side to the number 1 hit single &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;. Since the single and the double EP held at one time in December 1967 the top two slots on the British singles chart, the song had the distinction of being at number 1 and number 2 simultaneously.\n\n&quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; was the first studio recording made after the death of the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein in August 1967. The basic backing track featuring the Beatles was released in 1996 on Anthology 2. George Martin arranged and added orchestral accompaniment that included violins, cellos, horns, clarinet and a 16-piece choir. Paul McCartney said that Lennon gave instructions to Martin as to how he wished the orchestration to be scored, including singing most of the parts as a guide. A large group of professional studio vocalists named the Mike Sammes Singers, took part in the recording as well, variously singing &quot;Ho-ho-ho, hee-hee-hee, ha-ha-ha&quot;, &quot;oompah, oompah, stick it up your jumper!&quot;, &quot;everybody's got one&quot; and making a series of shrill whooping noises.\n\nAlthough it has been reported that Lennon wrote &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; to confuse those who tried to interpret his songs, there have been many attempts to analyse the meaning of the lyrics.\n\nSeen in the Magical Mystery Tour film singing the song, Lennon, apparently, is the walrus; on the track-list of the accompanying soundtrack EP/LP however, underneath &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; are printed the words ' &quot;No you're not!&quot; said Little Nicola' (in the film, Nicola is a little girl who keeps contradicting everything the other characters say).\n\nEric Burdon, lead singer of the Animals, claims to be the 'Eggman' mentioned in the song's lyric. Burdon was known as 'Eggs' to his friends, the nickname originating from his fondness for breaking eggs over naked women's bodies. Burdon's biography mentions such an affair taking place in the presence of John Lennon, who shouted &quot;Go on, go get it, Eggman...&quot;\n\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_the_Walrus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_the_Walrus&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CagBdaAgA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CagBdaAgA&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 7000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:04:41\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
