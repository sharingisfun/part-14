Then there's a tasty treat of vanilla shortbread with crÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me fraiche and clementines, and a rich and warming mulled wine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d695f7bcef34cb4d5bf60c4115280fb017808f1d","amp;dn":"Christmas+with+Gordon+Ramsey+S01+E02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d695f7bcef34cb4d5bf60c4115280fb017808f1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,149,247,188,239,52,203,77,91,246,12,65,21,40,15,176,23,128,143,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
