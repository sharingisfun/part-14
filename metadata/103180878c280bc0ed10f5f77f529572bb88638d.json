You can find it at: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html (Windows) and here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html (MacOS X)\n\nNOTE: The TRiPS release did not come with subtitles.  So, I downloaded the 720p HDTV subtitles, edited them, and then synched them up with this BluRay release.  The subtitles are separate .srt files, and if you do not want them, you can delete them or tap the V key while viewing in VLC.\n\nNOTE: There are samples and NFO for each episode as well as proof and a cover in a separate folder.  There is no cover for this online upload because bayimg has not been working\n\nNOTE: According to the NFO, the best audio available on the BluRay discs was AC3 @ 448kbps, so don't complain about the ripper's choice of audio, since he/she chose the best audio available.\n\nNOTE: I do not have constant Internet access as I am a very poor college student.  The only Internet access I have is when I am at the library or at a friend's house, so please be patient with this upload, as it may be a slow one.\n\nEnjoy, please seed, rate, and comment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103180878c280bc0ed10f5f77f529572bb88638d","amp;dn":"The.Borgias.S02.Season.2.720p.BluRay.x264-TRiPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103180878c280bc0ed10f5f77f529572bb88638d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,49,128,135,140,40,11,192,237,16,245,247,127,82,149,114,187,136,99,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
