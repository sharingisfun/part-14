They included three sonatas written by Bach and three sonatas attributed to Bach. Now, I hope you don't think me unduly pedantic, but I have only included here the three sonatas actually written by Bach. (My reasoning is as follows: When I sit down to listen to Bach, my desire is to listen to music written by-how should I put this?-Bach!)\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6668aaea818871f2a94029f443f6509f8d44899e","amp;dn":"Bach%2C+JS+-+Flute+Sonatas+-+Hewitt%2C+Oliva","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6668aaea818871f2a94029f443f6509f8d44899e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,104,170,234,129,136,113,242,169,64,41,244,67,246,80,159,141,68,137,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
