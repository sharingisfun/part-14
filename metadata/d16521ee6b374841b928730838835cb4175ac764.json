Warrior Within was developed and published by Ubisoft, and released on December 2, 2004 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe game picks up where The Sands of Time left off, adding new features, specifically, options in combat. The Prince now has the ability to wield two weapons at a time as well as the ability to steal his enemies' weapons and throw them. Warrior Within has a much darker tone than its predecessor adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with violent finishing moves.\n\n\n                                    Synopsis\nSeven years after the events of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, the Prince finds himself hunted by the Dahaka, the guardian of the timeline. Because the Prince escaped his fate, the Dahaka tries to ensure that the Prince dies as he was meant to. Seeking counsel from an old wise man, the Prince learns of the existence of the Island of Time, where the Sands of Time were created, which is ruled by the Empress of Time. The Prince sets sail for the Island of Time to attempt to prevent the Sands of Time from being created, by traveling backwards through time. He believes that if there are no Sands of Time, the Dahaka will cease to exist as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  Min System Requirements:\nSupported OS: WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 98SE/2000/XP (only)\nProcessor: PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® III 1 GHz or AMD Athlon 1 GHz\nRAM: 256 MB\nVideo Card: DirectX 9-compliant graphics card\nSound Card: DirectX 8-compliant sound car\nDirectX Version: 9.0c (included on disc\nCD-ROM: 16X CD-ROM or 4X DVD-ROM\nHard Drive Space: 2 GB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Instructions:\n\n\n   1)Extract with winrar \n   \n   2) Mount ISO file using daemon tools and install \n    \n   3) Copy Crack to warrior within directory \n   \n   4) Lastly Have fun Playing!!!!!!!!!\n    \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d16521ee6b374841b928730838835cb4175ac764","amp;dn":"Prince+of+Persia+Warrior+Within+%28with+crack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d16521ee6b374841b928730838835cb4175ac764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,101,33,238,107,55,72,65,185,40,115,8,56,131,92,180,23,90,199,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
