Sent out into the galaxy, these shatterlings have stood aloof as they document the rise and fall of countless human empires. They meet every 200,000 years to exchange news and memories of their travels with their siblings.\r\n\r\nNot only are Campion and Purslane late for their 30-second reunion but they have also brought along an amnesiac golden robot for a guest. But the wayward shatterlings get more than the scolding they expect: they face the discovery that someone has a very serious grudge against the Gentian line, and there is a very real possibility of traitors in their midst. The surviving shatterlings have to dodge exotic weapons while they regroup to try to solve the mystery of who is persecuting them and why---before their ancient line is wiped out of existence forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by John Lee\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged\r\n\r\nLength: 18 hrs and 16 mins\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:08-25-09","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9f35fb4de8aeb3ed9e13a6b1a3446759a16424d","amp;dn":"Alastair+Reynolds+-+House+of+Suns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9f35fb4de8aeb3ed9e13a6b1a3446759a16424d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,243,95,180,222,138,235,62,217,225,58,107,26,52,70,117,154,22,66,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
