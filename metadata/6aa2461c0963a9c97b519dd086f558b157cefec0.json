Out of the lineup with an injury, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s short-tempered, hard to handle, and every solid inch, a man.\n\nRight now, the only demand heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s making on Alicia is that she get him ready to pitch in time for opening day. Except the sexual chemistry between them is so charged, AliciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tempted to oblige Garrett just about anything. But both their careers are at stakeÃ¢â‚¬â€one bad move and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game over for both of them.\n\nGarrett also feels the hot sparks between them, and the way he figures it, what better therapy is there than sex? Now all he has to do is convince the woman with the power to make the call.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aa2461c0963a9c97b519dd086f558b157cefec0","amp;dn":"Jaci+Burton-Play+by+Play+05_Thrown+by+a+Curve.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aa2461c0963a9c97b519dd086f558b157cefec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,162,70,28,9,99,169,201,123,81,157,208,134,245,88,177,87,206,254,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
