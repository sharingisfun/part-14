The central story of the film is set at a time when Kurds were conscripted to serve in the Iraqi army, where they were brutally abused, as a despised minority in Saddam Hussein's military. Kilometre Zero pairs a Kurdish soldier, under orders to return the body of a dead soldier to his family, with an Iraqi taxi driver who will drive him to the dead soldier's home. Scenes between the men, in the close quarters of their truck, are interwoven with scenes of often comic incompetence of Iraqi soldiers and officers. \n\n\n\nAbout the Director \n\nHiner Saleem was born in Acna, Iraqi Kurdistan, in 1954. He fled to Italy by way of Syria in 1971, to escape the oppression of Saddam Hussein, and has lived in Paris for the past ten years. He is a fervent advocate for the rights of the Kurdish people, and regards April 9, 2003 - the day of the fall of Saddam Hussein - as the most beautiful day of his life. Saleem was honored as Chevalier des Arts et Lettres by the government of France in 2005. His films include Beyond Our Dreams (2000), and Vodka Lemon (2003), for which he won the Contro Corrente Grand Prize at the 2003 Venice Film Festival. His Long Live the BrideÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦and the Liberation of Kurdistan (1997) won the prize for best script at the Angers Film Festival. Kilometre Zero (2005) was selected for competition at the Festival Cannes 2005. \n\n\n\nLEARN MORE: \n\n\n\nMore information about Link's Global Lens series. \n\nVisit the Global Film Initiative. \n\nBuy Kilometre Zero here. \n\n\n\nFor educational resources regarding Kilometre Zero please click here. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc582b026868cd6d375afe2adbed67134b2fd475","amp;dn":"Kilometre+Zero+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc582b026868cd6d375afe2adbed67134b2fd475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,88,43,2,104,104,205,109,55,90,254,42,219,237,103,19,75,47,212,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
