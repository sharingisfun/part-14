From Aladdin and Pocahontas to the Asian American boy Russell in Up, from the first African American princess in The Princess and the Frog to &quot;Spanish-mode&quot; Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story 3, Disney films have come to both mirror and influence our increasingly diverse society. This essay collection gathers recent scholarship on representations of diversity in Disney and Disney/Pixar films, not only exploring race and gender, but also drawing on perspectives from newer areas of study, particularly sexuality/queer studies, critical whiteness studies, masculinity studies and disability studies. Covering a wide array of films, from Disney's early days and &quot;Golden Age&quot; to the Eisner era and current fare, these essays highlight the social impact and cultural significance of the entertainment giant.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nJohnson Cheu is an assistant professor in the Department of Writing, Rhetoric and American Cultures at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. He has published scholarly work in disability studies and popular culture studies, as well as poetry and creative essays.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36c53c8b46933a02bdfeee69935e58275b99cdc1","amp;dn":"Johnson+Cheu+-+Diversity+in+Disney+Films+%5B2013%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36c53c8b46933a02bdfeee69935e58275b99cdc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,197,60,139,70,147,58,2,189,254,238,105,147,94,88,39,91,153,205,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
