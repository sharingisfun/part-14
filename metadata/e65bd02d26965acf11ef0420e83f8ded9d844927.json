Though not his first appearance,\n this was the first album in which keyboard player Darren Wharton was credited as a permanent member,\n becoming the fifth member of the line-up. As such, he made a contribution as a songwriter on the opening track\n &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. However, even though he had officially joined the band, his picture was omitted from the album sleeve.\nRenegade was the second and final album to feature guitarist Snowy White.\n By his own admission, White was more suited to playing blues than heavy rock and he quit by mutual agreement \nthe following year.\n\n====================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1\tAngel of Death\t6:18\n2\tRenegade\t6:09\n3\tThe Pressure Will Blow\t3:48\n4\tLeave This Town\t3:50\n5\tHollywood (Down on Your Luck)\t4:10\n6\tNo One Told Him\t3:36\n7\tFats\t4:03\n8\tMexican Blood\t3:41\n9\tIt's Getting Dangerous\t5:35\n\n============================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.62GB\nAlbum                                    : Renegade \nTrack name/Total                         : 9\nPerformer                                : Thin Lizzy\nGenre                                    : Hard Rock\nRecorded date                            : 1981\n\n============================================\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 5 446 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 192 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\nWriting library                          : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e65bd02d26965acf11ef0420e83f8ded9d844927","amp;dn":"Thin+Lizzy+-+Renegade+%281981%29+Flac%5B24Bit+192KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e65bd02d26965acf11ef0420e83f8ded9d844927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,91,208,45,38,150,90,207,17,239,4,32,232,63,141,237,157,132,73,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
