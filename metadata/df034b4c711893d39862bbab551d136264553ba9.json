I have no desire for her to release the same album over and over, so I welcome this new record for the excellent piece of pop/rock that it is. There are so, so many great vintage Liz songs here, like &quot;It's Sweet,&quot; &quot;Take A Look,&quot; &quot;Little Digger&quot; &quot;Firewalker,&quot; &quot;Love/Hate Transmission&quot; and &quot;My Bionic Eyes.&quot; Yeah yeah yeah, the Matrix songs aren't really a lot like old Liz, unless you're enough of a fan to know &quot;Rocket Boy,&quot; or to realize that &quot;Jealousy&quot; and &quot;Johnny Feelgood&quot; are really the same kind of songs.\nIndie rockers, just grow up and admit you love Styx, Cheap Trick and Journey, and allow yourself to love this record too. And don't let some cheap sexism and ageism make you proclaim that songs like &quot;H.W.C.&quot; are stupid and embarrassing. If it had appeared on either of Liz's first two albums, it would be proclaimed a subversive masterpiece.\n\nDon't be an indiesnob. If you like Liz Phair the album, just let yourself like it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df034b4c711893d39862bbab551d136264553ba9","amp;dn":"Liz+Phair+-+Liz+Phair+-+FLAC+%28Big+Papi%29+2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df034b4c711893d39862bbab551d136264553ba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,3,75,76,113,24,147,211,152,98,187,171,85,29,19,98,100,85,59,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
