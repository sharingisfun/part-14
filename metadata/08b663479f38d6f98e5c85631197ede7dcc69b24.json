It was released in September 1995 by Polydor. The set includes all four studio albums by the Lou Reed-era line-ups of the Velvet Underground, alongside demo recordings and live performances, some of which were bootlegged, some of which were never released. Squeeze, recorded after Reed's departure from the band, is not included. The Velvet Underground, the band's self-titled third album, is presented in its famous &quot;closet mix&quot;, that is, Lou Reed's mix of the album that features a cramped, closed-in sound with more emphasis on vocals. The band's fourth album, Loaded, is presented with &quot;full-length versions&quot; of two of its tracks, &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;New Age&quot;.  Rolling Stone journalist David Fricke wrote extensive liner notes in an accompanying booklet, which also pictured many items of Velvet Underground memorabilia from the collection of guitarist Sterling Morrison.\n\nAmazon Review By --Mitch Myers - This comprehensive five-disc retrospective of the Velvet Underground chronicles the band from its earliest demo tapes, recorded in 1965, to Lou Reed's final work with band, in 1970. At their notorious peak, Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Moe Tucker epitomised the sound of intellectual art punks being spontaneously creative in Andy Warhol's Manhattan. Rock &amp; roll has never been the same since Reed's gutter-rock observations and Cale's cool, droning electric viola blanketing the band's mysterious three-chord innovations. It's all here: loads of feedback, classic songwriting, and Reed's transformation from Dylan imitator to sonic-rock auteur. With previously unreleased gems, live performances and other oddities, this is everything you wanted to know about the Velvets but were afraid to ask. \n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Venus In Furs [Demo]\n[02] Prominent Men [Demo]\n[03] Heroin [Demo]\n[04] IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Waiting For The Man [Demo]\n[05] Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams [Demo]\n[06] All Tomorrows Parties [Demo]\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:18m:07s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] All Tomorrow's Parties (Single Version)\n[02] Sunday Morning\n[03] I'm Waiting For The Man\n[04] Femme Fatale\n[05] Venus In Furs\n[06] Run Run Run\n[07] All Tomorrow's Parties\n[08] Heroin\n[09] There She Goes Again\n[10] I'll Be Your Mirror\n[11] The Black Angel's Death Song\n[12] European Son\n[13] Melody Laughter (Live)\n[14] It Was A Pleasure Then\n[15] Chelsea Girls\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:17m:56s\n\nCD-03 Track Listings\n\n[01] There Is No Reason (Demo)\n[02] Sheltered Life (Demo)\n[03] It's All Right (The Way That You Live) (Demo)\n[04] I'm Not Too Sorry (Now That You're Gone) (Demo)\n[05] Here She Comes Now (Demo)\n[06] Guess I'm Falling In Love (Live)\n[07] Booker T.
