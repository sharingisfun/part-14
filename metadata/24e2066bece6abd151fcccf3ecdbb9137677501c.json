On the other, he's a tattooed, guitar-playing bundle of bad boy. Maybe that's why Taylor's afraid of falling in love with him, or anyone else. She doesn't want to get burned, and even though her other roommates adore him, she wants him gone before it's too late.\n\nHunter himself has been been burned before, but the fact that Taylor calls him out on his crap and has the sexiest laugh ever make him decide maybe love isn't a lost cause. They make a bet: if she can convince him she truly loves or hates him, he'll leave the apartment--and leave her alone. The problem is, the more time they spend together, the less she hates him, and the more she moves toward love.\n\nBut when the man who holds the key to Taylor's fear of giving up her heart resurfaces and threatens to wreck everything, she has to decide: trust Hunter with her greatest secret, or do everything in her power to win that bet and drive him away forever.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n               Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24e2066bece6abd151fcccf3ecdbb9137677501c","amp;dn":"My+Favorite+Mistake+by+Chelsea+M.+Cameron","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24e2066bece6abd151fcccf3ecdbb9137677501c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,226,6,107,236,230,171,209,81,252,204,243,236,219,185,19,118,119,80,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
