Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always dubbed their music as simply &quot;rock and roll&quot;. To date they are one of the best-selling bands of all time, with a total of more than 200 million albums sold worldwide.\n\nAC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all time best-seller, selling over 10,000 copies per day in its first week.\n\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and was replaced by future Dio drummer Simon Wright. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Since then, the band's line-up remained the same until Malcolm Young's retirement in 2014. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, was released on 20 October 2008 and was the second-highest-selling album of that year. It was their biggest hit on the charts since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide.\n\nAC/DC had sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States alone, making them the tenth-best-selling band in the United States and one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-selling album by any artist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the third-highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; and were named the seventh &quot;Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time&quot; by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as &quot;the greatest rock and roll band of all time.&quot; In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBack in Black is the seventh studio album by Australian rock band AC/DC. Produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, the album was released on 25 July 1980 by Albert Productions and Atlantic Records. By the late 1970s, AC/DC began to achieve significant popularity outside their native Australia, with high-energy live performances and a string of successful albums. In 1979, they paired with producer Lange and recorded their international breakthrough, Highway to Hell. Shortly before the recording of their follow-up, lead vocalist Bon Scott died after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group continued on with ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson.\n\nBack in Black was recorded over seven weeks in the Bahamas in spring 1980. The area was hit by tropical storms at the time, making the sessions difficult at times. Johnson penned the album's lyrics and melodies, while guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young composed the music. Its musical content consists of hard rockÃ¢â‚¬â€œstyled numbers with lyrics relating to sex, alcohol, partying, and rock 'n' roll. Lange demanded perfection in the band's recordings, particularly on Johnson's vocals. Following its completion, the group mixed Back in Black at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. The album's all-black cover was designed as a &quot;sign of mourning&quot; for Scott.\n\nTheir sixth international release, Back in Black was an unprecedented success: it has sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide. Its enormous sales figures have made it tied for the second-highest selling album in history; in addition, the album has broken numerous records in sales. The band supported the album with a yearlong world tour, cementing them among the most popular music acts of the early 1980s. Back in Black received positive critical reception at the time of its release, and it has since been included on numerous lists of &quot;greatest&quot; albums. Since its initial release, the album has been reissued and remastered multiple times, most recently for digital distribution.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nBrian Johnson: lead vocals\nAngus Young: lead guitar\nMalcolm Young: rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nCliff Williams: bass guitar, backing vocals\nPhil Rudd: drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef17353e4a553cc35e1f824c53593dfdfde123d6","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+Back+In+Black+%5B1980%5D%5B2008%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BJPN+RMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef17353e4a553cc35e1f824c53593dfdfde123d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,23,53,62,74,85,60,195,94,31,130,76,83,89,61,253,253,225,35,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
