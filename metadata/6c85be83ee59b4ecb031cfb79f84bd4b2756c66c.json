Suite FranÃƒÂ§aise tells the remarkable story of men and women thrown together in circumstances beyond their control. As Parisians flee the city, human folly surfaces in every imaginable way: a wealthy mother searches for sweets in a town without food; a couple is terrified at the thought of losing their jobs, even as their world begins to fall apart. \n\nMoving on to a provincial village now occupied by German soldiers, the locals must learn to coexist with the enemyÃ¢â‚¬â€in their town, their homes, even in their hearts.When IrÃƒÂ¨ne NÃƒÂ©mirovsky began working on Suite FranÃƒÂ§aise, she was already a highly successful writer living in Paris. But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz, where she died. For sixty-four years, this novel remained hidden and unknown.\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c85be83ee59b4ecb031cfb79f84bd4b2756c66c","amp;dn":"Suite+Fran%26ccedil%3Baise+by+Irene+Nemirovsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c85be83ee59b4ecb031cfb79f84bd4b2756c66c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,133,190,131,238,89,180,236,176,49,207,183,159,132,189,75,39,86,198,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
