I've read about 20 books on energy over the past two years. For me, this one ranks a close second to Vaclav Smil's &quot;Energy at the Crossroads: Global Perspectives and Uncertainties&quot;; (&quot;Age of Oil&quot;, however, is much better suited for a general audience). I found it scholarly, logical, and pragmatic. I think readers will appreciate how Maugeri unravels the complex world of oil prices, economic, political and geological impact on exploration/production, and the mysteries of reserves accounting. At $49, the book is expensive, but I think it's worth the price to anyone who's interested in the history of and prognosis for oil. I read it in two nights and found it well worth the money.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb4787b0db59ae445b9a2a8c4d4a6aa6a9a04e2c","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Oil+The+Mythology%2C+History%2C+and+Future+of+the+World%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb4787b0db59ae445b9a2a8c4d4a6aa6a9a04e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,71,135,176,219,89,174,68,91,154,42,140,77,74,106,166,169,160,78,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
