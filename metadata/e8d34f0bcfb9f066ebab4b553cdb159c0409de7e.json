Sparks and his fellow Thunderbirds fought longest and hardest to defeat Hitler, often against his most fanatical troops, when the odds on the battlefield were even and the fortunes of the Allies hung in the balance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and when the difference between defeat and victory was a matter of character, not tactics or armor.\nDrawing on extensive interviews with Sparks and dozens of his men, as well as over five years of research in Europe and in archives across the US, historian Alex Kershaw masterfully recounts one of the most inspiring and heroic journeys in military history. Over the course of four amphibious invasions, Sparks rose from captain to colonel as he battled from the beaches of Sicily through the mountains of Italy and France, ultimately enduring bitter and desperate winter combat against the diehard SS on the FatherlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s borders. Though he lost all of his company to save the Allied beach-head at Anzio and an entire battalion in the dark forests of the Vosges, Sparks miraculously survived the long bloody march across Europe and was selected to lead a final charge to Bavaria to hunt down Adolf Hitler.\nIn the dying days of the Third Reich, Sparks and his men crossed the last great barrier in the West, the Rhine, only to experience some of the most intense street fighting and close combat suffered by Americans in WWII. When they finally arrived at the gates of Dachau, HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first and most notorious concentration camp, the Thunderbirds confronted scenes that robbed the mind of reason. With victory within grasp, Sparks confronted the ultimate test of his humanity: after all he had faced, could he resist the urge to wreak vengeance on the men who had caused untold suffering and misery?\nWritten with the narrative drive and vivid immediacy of KershawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous bestselling books about American infantrymen in WWII, The Liberator is a story for the ages, an intensely human and dramatic account of one of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest warriors and his unheralded role in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest achievement Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the defeat of Nazi Germany.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Liberator-Soldiers-500-Day-Odyssey/dp/0307887995&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Liberator-Soldiers-500-Day-Odyssey/dp/0307887995&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8d34f0bcfb9f066ebab4b553cdb159c0409de7e","amp;dn":"The+Liberator%3A+One+World+War+II+Soldier%27s+500-Day+Odyssey+from+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8d34f0bcfb9f066ebab4b553cdb159c0409de7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,211,79,11,207,185,240,102,235,171,75,85,60,219,21,156,4,9,222,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
