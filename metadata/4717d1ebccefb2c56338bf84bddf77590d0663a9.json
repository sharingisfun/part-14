Under the direction of Vernon N. Kisling, an expert in zoo history, an international team of authors has compiled the first comprehensive, global history of animal collections, menageries, zoos, and aquariums. Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Animal Collections to Zoological Gardens documents the continuum of efforts in maintaining wild animal collections from ancient civilizations through today.\n\nAlthough historical research on zoos and aquariums is still at a rudimentary stage, this book pulls together regional information along with the cultural aspects of each region to provide a foundation upon which further research can be based. It presents a chronological listing of the world's zoos and aquariums and features many never-before published photographs. Sidebars present supplementary information on pertinent personalities, events, and wildlife conservation issues. As an overview of the current state of our knowledge, Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Animal Collections to Zoological Gardens provides an extensive, chronological introduction to the subject and highlights the published and archival resources for those who want to know more.\n\nFeatures\n# Provides a comprehensive introduction to the history of animal collections, menageries, zoos, and aquariums\n# Contains nearly 70 illustrations, many never-before published\n# Features a chronological listing of the world's zoos and aquariums\n# Supplies interesting information on pertinent personalities, events, and wildlife conservation issues through the use of sidebars\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4717d1ebccefb2c56338bf84bddf77590d0663a9","amp;dn":"Zoo+and+Aquarium+History+-+Ancient+Animal+Collections+To+Zoologi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4717d1ebccefb2c56338bf84bddf77590d0663a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,23,209,235,204,239,178,197,99,56,191,132,189,223,119,89,13,6,99,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
