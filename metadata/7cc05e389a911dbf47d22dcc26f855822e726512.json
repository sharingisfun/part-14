These contestants will compete in weekly design challenges at Parsons The New School For Design in New York City, until only three remain and face off once again at New York Fashion Week in February.\n\nEager to give aspiring designers a chance to break into the notoriously difficult-to-crack fashion world, supermodel Heidi Klum will once again head a panel of industry luminaries, including top women's and men's wear designer Michael Kors and Elle Magazine fashion director Nina Garcia, who will serve as judges and industry mentors charged with selecting and molding the budding designers. There will also be guest judges each week based on the specific challenge. Tim Gunn, Chair of the Parsons The New School For Design, will return to guide the contestants through each of their challenges.\n\nThe winning designer will walk away with $100,000 in seed money to help them launch their own line. The winnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s designs will be featured in a spread in ELLE, photographed by the magazine's world-renowned Publication Director, Gilles Bensimon. They will also receive a mentorship from the Banana Republic Design Team.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore great TV Shows &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://publichash.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://publichash.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cc05e389a911dbf47d22dcc26f855822e726512","amp;dn":"Project.Runway.S11E12.Europe.Here.We.Come.HDTV.x264-RKSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cc05e389a911dbf47d22dcc26f855822e726512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,192,94,56,154,145,29,191,71,210,45,204,38,248,85,130,46,114,101,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
