Motion Picture Soundtrack \n\n\nIn the year 2000, Radiohead ditched its former rock sound for electronic post-rock. The result was Kid A, where they relearned everything they knew about music from scratch. Some people loved it. Some didn't get it, and felt it was pretentious. But there's one undeniable thing: this chilly, eerie collection is a marvelously complex piece of work. In a musical world where anything that has a guitar can be called rock, it's difficult to find music that is really creative. It's even harder to find a band that is willing to take risks, and expand their art. But those things can be found in Radiohead, and the evidence is here.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 68\nArtist: Radiohead\nAlbum: Kid A\nYear: 2000\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:642a1a6cc0b6559d9abf2edb1529d6c1e571fd60","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+Kid+A+%5BFLAC-2000%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"642a1a6cc0b6559d9abf2edb1529d6c1e571fd60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,42,26,108,192,182,85,157,154,191,46,219,21,41,214,193,229,113,253,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
