A concept \nalbum (in itself a brave undertaking by 1981), Time is set at the end of the \n21st century and is populated by a host of space-age themes and \ncharacters. What's most remarkable about the album is how all this science \nfiction silliness is salvaged by the overall exuberance of the playing. &quot;Yours \nTruly, 2095&quot; uses a number of ELO hallmarks--a catchy synth riff, sweeping \nstrings and over-the-top-production--to tell it's tale, of a man in love with a \nrobot, and become the album's highlight (and what should have been a hit \nsingle). Other tracks such as the epic &quot;Twilight&quot; and &quot;Hold On Tight&quot;--which \npractically bounces along like an overexcited puppy--also stand amongst \nELO's finest works. Moreover, critical darlings Grandaddy have frequently \nstated the album's influence on the recording of their excellent The \nSophtware Slump, proof that this futuristic concept album was itself years \nahead of its time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1958b82363800ff4c15cab7b3c0501b7939a882","amp;dn":"Electric+Light+Orchestra+-+Time+%282011%29+FLAC+Soup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1958b82363800ff4c15cab7b3c0501b7939a882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,149,139,130,54,56,0,255,76,21,202,183,179,192,80,27,121,57,168,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
