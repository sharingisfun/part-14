Like trumpeter Louis Armstrong, Tatum had an impact on the entire strata  of jazz instrumentation. \n\n\nAs A.B. Spellman observed in the liner notes to Giants of Jazz, Art Tatum, Tatum was &quot;blessed with fingers that moved almost as fast as his endless stream of ideas.&quot; Tatum's repertoire consisted primarily of a few original compositions, popular songs, jazz standards, and concert music pieces by such composers as Antonin Dvorak and Jules Massenet. \n\n\nDespite gaining popularity with a trio during the 1940s, Tatum's numerous solo performances still awe  listeners and represent some of the finest music of the twentieth century America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n1.
