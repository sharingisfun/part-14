A unique mix of rock and jazz. These are all piano instrumentals.\n\nRipped with EAC at 320kbps (VBR) though the quality is not true 320 as they were bought in iTunes and burnt to disc first.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:516e9e59bbd23b0f5e924f05967385c28b51c9c3","amp;dn":"ELEW%2FEric+Lewis+-+Rockjazz%2C+Vol.+1%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"516e9e59bbd23b0f5e924f05967385c28b51c9c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,110,158,89,187,210,59,15,94,146,79,5,150,115,133,194,139,81,201,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
