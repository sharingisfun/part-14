This knotty dilemma is the subject of Michael Foley's wry and accessible investigation into how the desirable states of well-being and satisfaction are constantly undermined by modern life. He examines the elusive condition of happiness common to philosophy, spiritual teachings, and contemporary psychology, then shows how these are becoming increasingly difficult to apply in a world of high expectations. The common challenges of earning a living, maintaining a relationship, and aging are becoming battlegrounds of existential angst and self-loathing in a culture that demands conspicuous consumption, high-octane partnerships, and perpetual youth. Ultimately, rather than denouncing and rejecting the age, Foley presents an entertaining strategy of not just accepting but embracing today's worldÃ¢â‚¬â€finding happiness in its absurdity.\n\nReview\n&quot;Delivers well-judged wisdom.&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€Oliver James, author, They F*** You Up\n\n\n&quot;Achingly funny and wise . . . vastly entertaining.&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€Daily Mail\n\n\n&quot;Michael Foley's entertaining, intelligent book may just help you get over yourself. . . . Absurdly readable.&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€Observer\n\n\n&quot;Bound to be compared to the works of Patrick McCabe and Roddy Doyle, Foley's novel is stingingly funny, ruefully perceptive and anything but unremarkable.&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly on Getting Used to Not Being Remarkable\nAbout the Author\nMichael Foley is a poet and novelist whose titles includ Beyond and Getting Used to Not Being Remarkable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cb55714e943230606b2df0e51508c314e39d99c","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Absurdity+Why+Modern+Life++Hard+to+be+Happy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cb55714e943230606b2df0e51508c314e39d99c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,181,87,20,233,67,35,6,6,178,223,14,81,80,140,49,78,57,217,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
