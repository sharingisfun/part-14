And their hits &quot;Steppin' Out,&quot; &quot;Just Like Me,&quot; &quot;Hungry,&quot; &quot;Him or Me-What's It Gonna Be,&quot; and &quot;Kicks,&quot; in particular, are now seen by compilers as bold, unpretentious pieces of '60s rock &amp; roll with a defiant, punk edge. Paul Revere was born on January 7, 1938 in Harvard, NE. He learned to play the piano as a boy, and developed a keen appreciation for the work of Spike Jones &amp; His City Slickers. He joined his first real band while in his teens, and was later joined by 16-year-old Mark Lindsay (b. March 9, 1942), a singer/saxman who ended up replacing the group's vocalist. Called the Downbeats, they were popular at local dances, and cut a demo for Gardena Records in Los Angeles, where the company's owner was interested in issuing a record, but only if they changed their name. Revere's given name was such a natural as a gimmick that they became Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders. Their third single, a Jerry Lee Lewis-style instrumental, charted low in the Hot 100, and by the middle of 1963, they were one of the major music attractions in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-revere-the-raiders-p118074/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-revere-the-raiders-p118074/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nA much more sensible buy than the double-CD Legend of Paul Revere, this 20-track compilation focuses on their toughest (and therefore best) early material. Has all the big early hits, and about half the songs weren't on Legend, most notably their fine pre-Monkees version of &quot;Steppin' Stone.&quot; Note that the version of &quot;Hungry&quot; here is an alternate take, good or bad news depending on whether you have the original hit rendition already.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-essential-ride-63-67-r216073&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-essential-ride-63-67-r216073&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002884&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002884&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
