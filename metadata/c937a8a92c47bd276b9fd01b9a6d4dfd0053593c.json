But as Robert Spencer writes in this important and disturbing pamphlet, the Brotherhood is also active in the U.S. and has been for decades. It is the moving force behind such Ã¢â‚¬Å“mainstreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ organizations as the Council on American Islamic Relations and the Muslim Students Association. As a document captured by the FBI in 1991 stated, working through these and other groups has allowed the Brotherhood to launch a stealth jihad aimed at Ã¢â‚¬Å“eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Spencer analyzes the BrotherhoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advances in America, its advocacy for Hamas and other terror groups through the &quot;moderate&quot; client organizations it has created, and the inroads it has made in the Obama administration.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nRobert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch, a program of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and the author of eight books on Islam and jihad. Spencer is a weekly columnist for Human Events and the website Front-Page Magazine, and has led seminars on Islam and jihad for the United States Central Command, United States Army Command and General Staff College, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and the U.S. intelligence community","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c937a8a92c47bd276b9fd01b9a6d4dfd0053593c","amp;dn":"Muslim+Brotherhood+in+America+-+Robert+Spencer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c937a8a92c47bd276b9fd01b9a6d4dfd0053593c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,55,168,169,44,71,189,39,107,159,208,27,154,109,77,253,0,83,89,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
