The story is told through the eyes of Miriam's young daughter Mary Catherine, for whom Odessa is a nanny. Odessa and her family are faced with all of the social problems typical of African Americans at the time: poverty, racism, violence, and discrimination based solely on the color of their skin. When a boycott of the city buses prevents Odessa from riding the bus to work, she is left with no other choice but to walk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b89d4426ca52ecee4c631c2ce2dbf50630c8b9ee","amp;dn":"The+Long+Walk+Home+%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b89d4426ca52ecee4c631c2ce2dbf50630c8b9ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,157,68,38,202,82,236,238,76,99,28,44,226,219,245,6,48,200,185,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
