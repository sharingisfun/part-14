The amazing thing about this varied selection is not its eclecticism--which is only to be expected with these two--but that it all blends together so seamlessly. Fleck's jazz-tinged compositions (like &quot;The Lake Effect&quot; ) and Meyer's bluegrass-inspired tunes (like &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot; ) sit so comfortably next to Bach's baroque jewels and Davis's cool jazz that it makes you question the entire of concept of musical classification. (In fact, the Bach preludes, inventions, and partitas translate so well to the banjo/bass arrangements, you have to wonder if old JSB might not have had a bit of bluegrass in his soul.) Music for Two was recorded live at a series of 2001 concerts, where Fleck and Meyer proved conclusively that the banjo and the bass were capable of remarkable subtlety and not just twang and boom. ~ Michael John Simmons \n\nBela Fleck and Edgar Meyer are the unequivocal masters of their respective instruments, the banjo and the string bass, and have been such close friends for so long that a colloborative effort seems like a natural evolution of their ouvre. Indeed, the beauty of this disc is that the music does not get bogged down under the weight of their combined musical genius. On Music for Two, a Sony Classical release, Fleck and Meyer weave intricate tapestries of sound, combining straight classical transcriptions of Bach (the original classical virtuoso and arguably the touchstone for all of western music) with improvised tunes from their own repertoire. &quot;Bug-Tussle&quot; and &quot;Pile Up&quot; are upbeat, catchy newgrass charts that are heavy on the improv. &quot;Blue Spruce&quot; is a new-agey Flecktune featuring Bela in a semi-rare performance on the six-string guitar and Edgar on piano. &quot;Wrong Number&quot; pulls a fast one on the live audience, as an interrupting cell phone becomes an elaborate gag that is worked into the song itself. And the Bach transcriptions are not only 100% faithful, but 100% flawless. The added DVD only enhances the listening experience, as you get to see fingers and hands in action, making the virtuosity of Fleck and Meyer even more apparent. In the end, &quot;Music for Two&quot; proves that sometimes when you combine two musical talents of this caliber, one plus one equals MUCH more than just two. ~ Dustin Georgemiller\n\nPersonnel:\nBela Fleck - guitar, banjo\nEdgar Meyer - piano, double bass\n \nMusic for Two - BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck &amp; Edgar Meyer DETAILED Tracks: (With Bela Fleck &amp; Edgar Meyer)\n\nBug Tussle \nComposed by Bela Fleck\n\nThree-Part Invention (Sinfonia), for keyboard No. 10 in G major, BWV 796 (BC L51) \nComposed by Johann Sebastian Bach\n\nPile-up \nComposed by Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer\n\nPrelude and Fugue, for keyboard No. 24 in B minor (WTC I/24), BWV 869 (BC L103) Prelude No. 24 \nComposed by Johann Sebastian Bach\n\nSolar \nComposed by Miles Davis\n\nBlue Spruce \nComposed by Bela Fleck\n\nCanon \nComposed by Edgar Meyer\n\nThe One I Left Behind \nComposed by Bela Fleck \n\nPartita for keyboard No. 1 in B flat major, BWV 825 (BC L1) Menuett I-II \nComposed by Johann Sebastian Bach \n\nPrelude and Fugue, for keyboard No. 2 in C minor (WTC I/2), BWV 847 (BC L81) Prelude No. 2 \nComposed by Johann Sebastian Bach \n\nPalmyra \nComposed by Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer \n\nThe Lake Effect \nComposed by Bela Fleck \n\nSonata for double bass in G minor Largo \nComposed by Henry Eccles \n\nSonata for double bass in G minor Allegro Vivace \nComposed by Henry Eccles \n\nWrong Number \nComposed by Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer \n\nWoolly Mammoth \nComposed by Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer \n\nWishful Thinking, for double bass \nComposed by Edgar Meyer \n\nMusic for Two - BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck &amp; Edgar Meyer Tracks:\n01  Bug Tussle \n02  Three-Part Invention \n03  Pile-Up \n04  Prelude No. 24 (From the Well-Tempered Clavier, Second Book) \n05  Solar \n06  Blue Spruce \n07  Canon \n08  One I Left Behind, The \n09  V.
