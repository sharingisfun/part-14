The advent of new, outstanding actuators will bring innovation to a range of different areas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ such as basic science, industry, medicine, welfare, and the global environment ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and in this way will provide us with a better quality of life.\n\n \n\nNext-Generation Actuators Leading Breakthroughs is the proceedings of the final symposium of MEXT Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas: Next-Generation Actuators Leading Breakthroughs, held in January 2010.\n\n \n\nThis project pursues the realization of next-generation actuators and accumulates the common basic technologies for actuators, with a view to possible future applications. Since the realization of next-generation actuators requires an interdisciplinary approach, the research has been organized according to a broad technological perspective that consists of:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ actuators for small motion of nano-meters;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ small-size actuators of micro-meters structures;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ intelligent actuators for functional motions;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ power actuators for large force/torque; and\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ actuators for special environments.\n\nNext-Generation Actuators Leading Breakthroughs also deals with common fundamental technologies for these actuators, such as intelligent materials, machining processes, control technologies, evaluation methods, and system integration. It provides cutting-edge research for researchers, postgraduates, and practitioners in mechanical, electrical, and materials industries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f790d93527c9d94847cdb15c21247504a11e2db2","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Next-Generation+Actuators+Leading+Breakthroughs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f790d93527c9d94847cdb15c21247504a11e2db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,144,217,53,39,201,217,72,71,205,177,92,33,36,117,4,161,30,45,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
