The loss of his wallet deprives Warren of any evidence of his identity, and everyone assumes he is one of the many who are on the road, unemployed because of the Depression...\n\nSharples, once a prosperous town, is so entirely bound up with the shipyard that was its major employer that when the shipyard failed, so did the town. Unemployment is very high, and few shops remain open. The hospital is still open, however, and Warren is operated on successfully. While recovering he learns of the town's plight, as he starts becoming attracted to...\n\n\nThe book is, to some extent, based on Shute's own experience as a director of Airspeed, Ltd.\n\n\n  From AudioFile:\nWealthy London banker Henry Warren's life has become a shambles until he stumbles into the severely depressed town of Sharples. The spirit of the unemployed townspeople gives Warren's life new direction and some surprises, which make for lively listening. Robin Bailey's reading is impeccably clear, and the pace is perfect. He depicts each character with a different voice. From the butler's imperious attitude to the bluster of the tram driver, the narrator captures our attention. Women's voices are done with equal professionalism. Highly recommended for any popular fiction collection.\n\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nTechnical notes:\n\nPost processing on some tracks to reduce tape hiss, using Audacity 1.3.7.\n&quot;Noise Removal&quot; effect, generating &quot;Noise profile&quot; on blank spots,\n(specifying what we want filtered) then used conservative settings\nto choose how much of that noise we want filtered. Preserving voice\nintegrity more important than noise removal.\nNoise reduction: 7dB, Frequency smoothing: 180Hz, Attack/decay time: 0.17 secs.\nLastly, tracks were normalized, to -0.5 dB.\nThen exported with Lame 3.98 encoder, still at 80kbps mono.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f4fdca4d7296d1974da585df57224cad4dcf331","amp;dn":"RUINED+CITY+-+Nevil+Shute.+Read+by+Robin+Bailey+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f4fdca4d7296d1974da585df57224cad4dcf331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,79,220,164,215,41,109,25,116,218,88,93,245,114,36,202,212,220,243,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
