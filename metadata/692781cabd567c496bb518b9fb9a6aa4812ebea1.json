The squadron became known as the &quot;Dam Busters&quot; because of Operation Chastise, a mission using highly specialised bombs to destroy Ruhr dams in Germany.\n\nThe book also covers the subsequent history of 617 Squadron, as an elite squadron specializing in attacking difficult targets with outsize weapons and precision techniques. \n\nAmong Gibson's successors as commander was Group Captain Leonard Cheshire V.C., and the book describes Cheshire's unorthodox leadership style and innovative target marking techniques.\n\nThe original edition of the book did not include some of the details of the dams raids, as these were still classified at the time, most significantly that the weapons bounced on the water surface before reaching its target. Later editions included these details.\n\nIn 1954 a film The Dam Busters was made based on both Gibson's Enemy Coast Ahead and on Brickhill's book. Named after the latter, the movie starred Richard Todd as Gibson and Michael Redgrave as Barnes Wallis.\n\nA new remake, Dambusters, produced by Peter Jackson and David Frost, directed by Christian Rivers and scripted by Stephen Fry, commenced filming in 2009.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dam_Busters_%28book%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dam_Busters_%28book%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Chastise&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Chastise&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._617_Squadron_RAF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._617_Squadron_RAF&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dambusters.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dambusters.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nProduct details\n\n    * Paperback: 272 pages\n    * Publisher: Pan Books; New ed of 2 Revised ed edition (22 Jan 1999)\n    * Language English\n    * ISBN-10: 0330376446\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0330376440\n\n\nInteresting Note - A 1955 film, The Dam Busters was made about the raids and was very popular. Its depiction of the raid, along with a similar sequence in the film 633 Squadron, provided the inspiration for the Death Star trench run in Star Wars: A New Hope. \n\nThe film is also watched on television by the character Pink in the 1982 film, Pink Floyd The Wall.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:692781cabd567c496bb518b9fb9a6aa4812ebea1","amp;dn":"Paul+Brickhill+-+The+Dam+Busters+%28RAF+WWII+History%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"692781cabd567c496bb518b9fb9a6aa4812ebea1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,39,129,202,189,86,124,73,107,181,24,185,251,154,106,164,129,46,190,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
