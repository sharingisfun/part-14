Ayahuasca in My Blood - 25 Years of Medicine Dreaming concerns his longstanding relationship with the Amazonian visionary medicine. Here's what people have said about it:\n\n&quot;Unlike many writing about ayahuasca, Peter Gorman knows this plant and these forests long and well. Explorer, ethnobotanist, writer and raconteur - Gorman is uniquely qualified to tell this incredible tale. A wild mixture of adventure, horror, spirituality, tenderness, and insight, Ayahuasca in My Blood is most highly recommended!&quot;\n\n-- Mark J. Plotkin, author of Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice.\n\nI have been devouring this book. Peter, you are the real deal -- you are a true mitayero, a man of the jungle, and you have had adventures others can only dream of. And you are a wonderful storyteller, powerfully honest about yourself, with a deep connection to the spiritual life of the Upper Amazon, both the light and the dark. I am recommending it to everyone.\n-- Steve Beyer, author of Singing to the plants\n\n\n&quot;Long before ayahuasca tourism became a pastime for rich gringos, Peter Gorman was knocking around Iquitos and the Amazon. He's traveled the rivers and quaffed the brew with the best (and the worst) of them and been way, way beyond the chrysanthemum on many a dark jungle night. This is the intensely personal story of an old-school jungle rat for whom ayahuasca is not just a hobby, but a life-long quest.&quot; \n\n-- Dennis McKenna, Ph.D, co-author of The Invisible Landscape\n\n&quot;I have known and traveled with Peter for almost a decade and was present for a number of the events he included in this book as well as many others. Don Julio was the most powerful man I have ever had the privilege of knowing. Further, as a trained scientist I believe the plant medicine truly offers a doorway to a rich world that needs to be understood in our postmodern lives. This is destined to become a must read for anyone who is serious about understanding the world of the shaman.&quot; \n\n-- Lynn Chilson - CEO Chilson Enterprises, Inc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee918ace529136c21e17282ac55a5e9b5f47b737","amp;dn":"Ayahuasca+in+My+Blood%3A+25+Years+of+Medicine+Dreaming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee918ace529136c21e17282ac55a5e9b5f47b737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,145,138,206,82,145,54,194,30,23,40,42,197,90,94,155,95,71,183,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
