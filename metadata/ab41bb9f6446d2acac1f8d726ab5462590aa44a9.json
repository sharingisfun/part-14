Creative People Must Be Stopped shows how individuals and organizations sabotage their own best intentions to encourage &quot;outside the box&quot; thinking. It shows that the antidote to this self-defeating behavior is to identify which of the six major types of constraints are hindering innovation: individual, group, organizational, industry-wide, societal, or technological. Once innovators and other leaders understand exactly which constraints are working against them and how to overcome them, they can create conditions that foster innovation instead of stopping it in its tracks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab41bb9f6446d2acac1f8d726ab5462590aa44a9","amp;dn":"Creative+People+Must+Be+Stopped%3A+6+Ways+We+Kill+Innovation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab41bb9f6446d2acac1f8d726ab5462590aa44a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,65,187,159,100,70,210,172,172,31,141,114,106,181,70,37,144,170,68,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
