A good part of the album's success was due to the hit single Smoking Gun which Rolling Stone called &quot;a smoldering tale of jealousy and murder&quot;. This album won a 1988 Grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Recording.\n\n\n \n\n\n&quot;Strong Persuader&quot; was a milestone both for Robert Cray and blues in the '80s. It earned Cray, a veteran of the Pacific Northwest blues scene, both his first solo Grammy and Top 30 hit ('Smoking Gun') along with a lift out of the blues ghetto which he'd been excelling in during recent years. As for the blues themselves, Cray infused fresh blood into a genre that had been limping along in that particular decade. With a smooth singing style to go with an equally recognizable guitar tone, Cray developed a sound that owed as much to soul stylist O.V. Wright as it did to Texas guitarist Albert Collins (with whom Cray had won a Grammy along with Johnny Copeland the prior year). The use of the Memphis Horns strengthened the soul connection on songs such as the punchy 'Nothing But A Woman' and the chugging effervescence of 'Guess I Showed Her.' Of course, Cray's heart lay in the blues and when he wasn't lamenting the woes of infidelity in 'Right Next Door (Because Of Me)' and a bad break-up in 'Still Around,' his guitar playing smoldered throughout the forlorn 'New Blood'.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Smoking Gun\n 02 - I Guess I Showed Her\n 03 - Right Next Door (Because Of Me)\n 04 - Nothin' But A Woman\n 05 - Still Around\n 06 - More Than I Can Stand\n 07 - Foul Play\n 08 - I Wonder\n 09 - Fantasized\n 10 - New Blood\n\n Produced by Bruce Bromberg &amp; Dennis Walker.\n Recorded at Sage &amp; Sound, Los Angeles; Haywood's, LA.\n Digitally remastered.\n\nMusicians:\n Robert Cray - vocals, guitar\n Richard Cousins - bass\n David Olson - drums\n Lee Spath - percussion\n Peter Boe - keyboards\n Andrew Love - tenor saxophone\n Wayne Jackson - trumpet, trombone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7698b11e55a83ee6dfccb2a8991b534cca30e884","amp;dn":"Robert+Cray+-+Strong+Persuader+%281986%2F2015%29+24%2F192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7698b11e55a83ee6dfccb2a8991b534cca30e884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,152,177,30,85,168,62,230,223,204,178,168,153,27,83,76,202,48,232,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
