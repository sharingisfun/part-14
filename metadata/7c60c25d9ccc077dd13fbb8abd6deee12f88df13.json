Widely regarded as one-to-watch\nsince making his production debut in 2007, the Neopolitan\nCapriati's rise to prominence has been nothing short of relentless.\nHaving grown up on a diet of early hip hop and classic house from\nthe likes of Masters At Work, Todd Terry and Danny Tenaglia,\nCapriati cut his teeth playing to his friends in garages and\nbasements after school. However a pivotal 12 hour party in Naples,\n2003 featuring Dave Clarke, Billy Nasty and Rino Cerrone\nintroduced the young Capriati to a new world of techno. The sound\nleft an indelible mark and a new course was set.\n\nNow he is collaborating with Adam Beyer's Drumcode label, for whom\nhe released his ÃƒÂ¦Self-Portrait' album in 2013; resident at Marco\nCarola's ÃƒÂ¦Music On' events in Ibiza since its inception; a\npriority artist for global festivals such as Awakenings, Time\nWarp, Monegros, Tomorrowland and Kazantip; and a firm favorite\nwith club crowds across Europe and North &amp; South America,\nCapriati's emergence within techno continues the strong lineage of\ntalent from his native Naples upbringing.\n\nÃƒÂ´I recorded the mix live in my studio with 2 CDJs and a mixer,\nlike if I was mixing at fabric. I made a tracklist with various\ntechno and tech house tastes, with some vocals and melodies\nincluded, like a journey at fabric, passing from room 1 to room 2\nand going back to the room 1 for the last track, which is melodic\nand emotional, like if it was 9am and the club was going to close,\nand you will never forget that night.ÃƒÂ¶\nJoseph Capriati\n\n_________________________[ Tracklist\n\nCD 1/1\n\n1.
