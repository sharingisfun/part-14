Now, he has journeyed to the Sothoii Wind Plain to oversee the parole he granted to Tellian and his men, to represent the Order of Tomanak, the War God, and to be an ambassador for the hradani. \n\nWhat's more, the flying coursers of the Sothoii have accepted Bahzell as a windriderÃ¢â‚¬â€the first hradani windrider in history. And since the windriders are the elite of the elite among the Sothoii, Bahzell's ascension is as likely to stir resentment as respect. That combination of duties would have been enough to keep anyone busyÃ¢â‚¬â€even a warrior prince like BahzellÃ¢â‚¬â€but additional complications are bubbling under the surface. \n\nThe goddess Shigu, the Queen of Hell, is sowing dissension among the war maids of the Sothoii. The supporters of the deposed Sothoii noble who started the war are plotting to murder their new leige lord and frame Bahzell for the deed. Of course, those problems are all in a day's work for a champion of the War God. But what is Bahzell going to do about the fact that Baron Tellian's daughter, the heir to the realm, seems to be thinking that he is the only manÃ¢â‚¬â€or hradaniÃ¢â‚¬â€for her.\n\nGenre: Fantasy\n\n-\nWar God series 1 &amp; 2\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9666401/War_God_series_by_David_Weber_%2801-02%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9666401/War_God_series_by_David_Weber_%2801-02%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca8d2ced178093dc07e923f5fc5634ce22a1748a","amp;dn":"Wind+Rider%27s+Oath+by+David+Weber+%28War+God+Series+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca8d2ced178093dc07e923f5fc5634ce22a1748a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,141,44,237,23,128,147,220,7,233,35,245,252,86,52,206,34,161,116,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
