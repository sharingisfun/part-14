Each DVD contains four episodes. Each episode takes 50 minutes to play. The whole disc requires 3 hours 20 minutes to play. This one contains episodes 9,10,11,12. In all there are 27 episodes; the final one, rather than containing the last video, is  labeled &quot;X&quot; and contains a documentary of making the film as well as interviews with people on the streets of London.\n\nTwo text files are included: one has commentaries taken from the IMBd site, which will give a much better overall review of the series than I can, and the other has closed captions of all four episodes together. \n\nThe quality of the picture leaves something to be desired. After several efforts to improve it by changing contrast, brightness levels and sharpness, I decided to leave things alone. It seems to me the video has too much contrast. It's strange since many other high quality movies were being made at that time.\nSome of the outdoor scenes are bad.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b81ec729b5d02d7f2647c19c35a5be5095bd3f","amp;dn":"The+Forsyte+Saga+3+%281967%29+BBC+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b81ec729b5d02d7f2647c19c35a5be5095bd3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,184,30,199,41,181,208,45,127,38,71,193,156,53,165,190,80,149,189,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
