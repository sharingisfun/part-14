Setting off to Join General Robert E. Lee's army, Starbuck's men reach Harper's Ferry in time to take part in Stonewall Jackson's capture of the Union garrison. From there, the regiment moves on to the legendary horror of Sharpsburg, beside the Antietam Creek, forever to be remembered as the bloodiest single day of the war. There, Starbuck and his troop will have their courage and commitment tested as never before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abb4fcd20709b610564c0e6dffe39e181c2a0764","amp;dn":"The+Bloody+Ground+%28The+Nathaniel+Starbuck+Chronicles%2C+%234%29+-+Bern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abb4fcd20709b610564c0e6dffe39e181c2a0764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,180,252,210,7,9,182,16,86,76,14,109,255,227,158,24,28,42,7,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
