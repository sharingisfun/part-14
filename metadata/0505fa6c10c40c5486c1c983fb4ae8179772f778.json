The playing is awesome, with Adrian, Dave and Janick tearing off the walls with their guitars, Steve making the ground tremble, Nicko smashing the drums and Bruce giving the performance of the decade. The band sounds better than ever, the real highlights of this show are: the band (of course), the scenery (the album backgrounds are awesome), and Bruce singing Blaze Bayley's songs (I mean, the Clansman is to me one of the best songs of the whole DVD, the shredding screams of &quot;Freedom!&quot; sound really energetic, completely different from the studio version). So all in all, this is a must have for any Maiden fan, and even if you aren't a fan, this is one of the most awesome DVDs ever. \n\n.: Trama :.\n\nRock in Rio ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ un doppio album dal vivo del gruppo heavy metal britannico Iron Maiden. Fu inciso nel 2001 al festival Rock in Rio svoltosi a Rio de Janeiro, e pubblicato nel 2002.
