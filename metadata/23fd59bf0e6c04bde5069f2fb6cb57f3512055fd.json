No Plot? No Problem! is the kick in the pants you've been waiting for.\n\nLet Chris Baty, founder of the rockin' literary marathon National Novel Writing Month (a.k.a. NaNoWriMo), guide you through four exciting weeks of hard-core noveling. \n\nBaty's pep talks and essential survival strategies cover the initial momentum and energy of Week One, the critical &quot;plot flashes&quot; of Week Two, the &quot;Can I quit now?&quot; impulses of Week Three, and the champagne and roar of the crowd during Week Four. \n\nWhether you're a first-time novelist who just can't seem to get pen to paper or a results-oriented writer seeking a creative on-ramp into the world of publishing, this is the adventure for you.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? The No Plot? approach worked for the thousands of people who've signed up for NaNoWriMo, and it can work for you! Let No Plot? No Problem! help you get fired up and on the right track.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23fd59bf0e6c04bde5069f2fb6cb57f3512055fd","amp;dn":"No+Plot%3F+No+Problem%21%3A+A+Low-Stress%2C+High-Velocity+Guide...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23fd59bf0e6c04bde5069f2fb6cb57f3512055fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,253,89,191,14,108,4,189,229,6,159,47,182,203,87,243,81,32,85,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
