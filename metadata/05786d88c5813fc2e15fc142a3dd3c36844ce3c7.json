Even with all the careening musical eclecticism, what distinguishes Undercover is its bleak, nihilistic attitude -- it's teeming with sickness, with violence, kinky sex, and loathing dripping from almost every song. &quot;Undercover of the Night&quot; slams with echoing guitars and rubbery basslines, as Jagger gives a feverish litany of sex, corruption, and suicide. It set the tone for the rest of the album, whether it's the runaway nymphomaniac of &quot;She Was Hot&quot; or the ridiculous slasher imagery of &quot;Too Much Blood.&quot; Only Keith's &quot;Wanna Hold You&quot; offers a reprieve from the carnage, and its relentless bloodletting makes the album a singularly fascinating listen. For some observers, that mixture was nearly too difficult to stomach, but for others, it's a fascinating record, particularly since much of its nastiness feels as if the Stones, and Jagger and Richards in particular, are running out of patience with each other. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05786d88c5813fc2e15fc142a3dd3c36844ce3c7","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Undercover+%282014%29+Universal+Music+Japan+UIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05786d88c5813fc2e15fc142a3dd3c36844ce3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,120,109,136,197,129,63,194,225,95,193,66,163,221,60,54,132,76,227,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
