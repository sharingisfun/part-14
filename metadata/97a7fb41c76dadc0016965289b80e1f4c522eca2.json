From the Communist North to the U.S. supported South, it saw one nation brutally torn apart, and at the heart of it, one man.\nLt. Colonel John Paul Vann (Bill Paxton- Titanic, Twister, Apollo 13) is one of the first U.S. senior military advisors sent to Vietnam. Vann is as complex as the war itself- a husband and father who takes lovers as casually as he takes control of every situation.....except one. In Vietnam, Vann finds himself fighting a war he cannot win alongside a corrupt and demoralized South Vietnamese Army. But what leads a man to expose the truth and sacrifice his career? To fly from a loving home to a war-torn battlefield. To turn from a soldier of strategy to a general of ruthless bombing campaigns which can only destroy what they cannot defeat.\nA man- a time- a nation of change. What they share together and what tears them apart is A BRIGHT SHINING LIE.\n\n\n\nIn my own personal opinion, another important moment in American History that effects many alive today, and Bill Paxton at Bill Paxton's Best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a7fb41c76dadc0016965289b80e1f4c522eca2","amp;dn":"A+Bright+Shining+Lie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a7fb41c76dadc0016965289b80e1f4c522eca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,167,251,65,199,109,173,192,1,105,101,40,155,128,225,244,197,34,236,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
