It seamlessly integrates the sound of the 80's analog classics  and \n   the ambitious electronic club drums of the 90's into the virtual instrument \n   hosts of  the 21st  century. The  Attack generates  all its  sounds in real \n   time, giving you the freedom to alter all parameters directly. \n             \n   D-Pole    \n             \n   The D-Pole is  a musically versatile  Filter Plug-In which  offers the same \n   powerful capabilities as the hardware equivalent. Now nothing prevents  you \n   from filtering your voice with no less than 5 filter types. Morph a  simple \n   acoustic  drum loop  into a  biting groovy  dance rhythm  using the  tempo \n   -synchronizable LFO.  Overdrive the  signal up  to +52dB.  Get the  vintage \n   ring-modulated sound for  really wild experiments  and send it  through the \n   stereo delay, or reduce the sample  rate of the signal until you  only hear \n   bleeps and clicks. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f60c5a48ff5a0b1742170d3bc8ae6bca43e69ce","amp;dn":"Waldorf+Edition+Plug-In+Suite+1.7.3+WIN+OSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f60c5a48ff5a0b1742170d3bc8ae6bca43e69ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,96,197,164,143,245,160,177,116,33,112,211,188,138,230,188,164,62,105,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
