Homecoming Ranch [Pine River, #01] - Julia London\n\nNew York Times and USA Today bestselling author Julia London launches a triumphant, emotional, heartwarming story about finding love, family and home.\n\nMadeline Pruett has made up for a lonely childhood and being raised by an irresponsible single mom by creating a solitary world where timetables and highlighters are essential for the predictability she craves. But Madeline is shocked out of her carefully constructed life by word that a father she never knew has died and left her an inheritance and, surprisingly, two unknown sisters. Madeline hopes that she can fly to Colorado, meet her sisters, discover her inheritance, and return to Orlando in a few days to close the biggest deal of her budding real estate career and get back to what she knows best: a quiet life.\n\nFor years, Luke Kendrick has juggled school and career and rescuing his family from illness, death and financial crisis. But he has never lost sight of his goals: building and selling his own dream homes. Just when it seems that dream might finally materialize, Luke is called home to Pine River, Colorado to reclaim the ranch his father lost in a gentlemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s agreement. He is not surprisedÃ¢â‚¬â€LukeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family knows he will put his life on hold to rescue them...again. But Luke is surprised by a sexy yet uptight button-up woman in impractical shoes who thinks his ranch now belongs to her.\n\nMadeline isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure how to put order to a sprawling, rundown ranch, not to mention a pair of sisters who are nothing like what she imagined or hoped them to be. The only thing sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure of is that careful planning is useless in a place where roads have names like Sometimes Pass and men as ruggedly handsome as Luke Kendrick behave so unpredictably.\n\nAs Luke and Madeline go toe to toe over the future of the ranch, sparks fly as hot and fiery as their kisses. Madeline thinks sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the expert, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Luke who teaches her a thing or twoÃ¢â‚¬â€about breaking down walls, finding home, and the true meaning of family.\n\n02. Return To Homecoming Ranch [Pine River, #02] - Julia London\n\nNew York Times and USA Today bestselling author Julia London delivers another standalone, heartwarming love story in her Pine River series.\n\nCurly-haired Libby Tyler never stops smilingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until her beloved boyfriend suddenly forces her out of their home and away from his adoring kids. When she learns he dumped her for his flighty ex-wife, LibbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sadness turns to furyÃ¢â‚¬â€and she very publicly smashes his truck with a golf club, earning herself a trip to a mental health center for some Ã¢â‚¬Å“rest.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHandsome, hazel-eyed deputy Sam Winters has been sober for two years. Afraid of backsliding, he lives in the mountains and keeps his distance from people. Yet he never forgot Libby, his former colleague at the sheriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office whose charm and cheerfulness always warmed his days.\n\nNow LibbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s back, ignoring the townspeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whispers (and her exÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s restraining order) while desperately trying to make Homecoming Ranch a successful event destination. She keeps causing trouble for Sam, but he finds her smile more beautiful than everÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and his touch gives her thrills sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never felt.

But when a client asks him to track down Emma Tyler to retrieve a stolen memento, Cooper canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn down the moneyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or the chance to see the beautiful Emma again.\n\nWhen Cooper comes to collect the item, Emma refuses to admit the horrible truth.
