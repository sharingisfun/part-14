Soon the familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world of carefully guarded royal privilege is swept up in the chaos of revolution and forced exodus.\n\nOver the next four years, as she endures the deaths of family members, starvation, and brutal forced labor, Raami clings to the only remaining vestige of childhoodÃ¢â‚¬â€the mythical legends and poems told to her by her father. In a climate of systematic violence where memory is sickness and justification for execution, Raami fights for her improbable survival.\n\nDisplaying the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary gift for language, In the Shadow of the Banyan is testament to the transcendent power of narrative and a brilliantly wrought tale of human resilience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62b589de09c7b1e1646142a4616135d986ddf14c","amp;dn":"In+the+Shadow+of+the+Banyan+-+Vaddey+Ratner+.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62b589de09c7b1e1646142a4616135d986ddf14c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,181,137,222,9,199,177,225,100,97,66,164,97,97,53,217,134,221,241,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
