Besides the classical capstones--the change of variables formula, implicit and inverse function theorems, the integral theorems of Gauss and Stokes--the text treats other important topics in differential analysis, such as Morse's lemma and the PoincarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© lemma.  The ideas behind most topics can be understood with just two or three variables.  The book incorporates modern computational tools to give visualization real power.  Using 2D and 3D graphics, the book offers new insights into fundamental elements of the calculus of differentiable maps.  The geometric theme continues with an analysis of the physical meaning of the divergence and the curl at a level of detail not found in other advanced calculus books.  This is a textbook for undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, the physical sciences, and economics.  Prerequisites are an introduction to linear algebra and multivariable calculus.  There is enough material for a year-long course on advanced calculus and for a variety of semester courses--including topics in geometry.  The measured pace of the book, with its extensive examples and illustrations, make it especially suitable for independent study.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 542 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (September 17, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1441973311\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1441973313","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13fbb2eb344cfb32dcafde7e600af3754547c15f","amp;dn":"Advanced+Calculus+-+A+Geometric+View%2C+1st+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13fbb2eb344cfb32dcafde7e600af3754547c15f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,251,178,235,52,76,251,50,220,175,222,126,96,10,243,117,69,71,193,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
