This is especially true since the advent of the compact disc. These sessions not only capture Parker's alto brillance but highlight his interaction with such jazz stalwarts as Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Duke Jordan, Max Roach, Erroll Garner, Howard McGhee and Dodo Marmarosa. This four-disc set is broken up into Hollywood Sessions 1: Moose the Mooche, Hollywood Sessions 2: Relaxin' at Camarillo, New York Sessions 1: Scrapple from the Apple, and New York Sessions 2: Drifting on a Reed. It's fortunate that these slices of jazz history are available allowing the listener to hear several takes of classics like &quot;Moose the Mooch,&quot; &quot;Relaxin at Camarillo,&quot; &quot;Scrapple from the Apple,&quot; and &quot;Ornithology&quot; take shape. Sound quality on these Stash discs is good for the most part, fair but not great on others.\n\nRecorded from 1945-1947, this CD set respresents Charlie Parker at his most creative. The genius of Bird - the creator of Bebop - is clearly evident in his solos: they unfold with daring melodic and rhythmic invention, clear tone, and with a precise, underlying logic that seems impossible at the sizzling speed with which he plays. While many jazz musicians seem to &quot;play with the changes&quot;, Bird invents solos so new and complete its as if he's composing a song every time he solos. And, this CD set has many of Bird's own compositions, all of which formed the backbone of the Bebop musician's repertoire. Also, A young Miles Davis is on hand for almost every tune. His solos, full of simple intricacy, demonstrate how Miles was also one of the few true improvisers/creators in Jazz. This CD set is a must for any Jazz, Bebop, Parker, or Davis fan or enthusiast. Even Classical music fans may appreciate Bird's improvisation, for it is strongly influenced by Baroque-era notions of melodic creation. Listen to Bach's 2- or 3-part piano inventions, then listen to Bird. You'll be amazed at what you find, or rather, what you hear.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD 1:\n01.
