To this end, we have indulged in and experimented with all manner of frightening, toxic, even potentially lethal substances, in many different rituals.\n\nANCIENT DRUGS delves into mankind's psyche in search of the key to our pervasive drive to experience something &quot;beyond.&quot; Psychologists and physicians, including Dr. Andrew Weil, world-famous author of the bestselling Spontaneous Healing, offer insight into the physical and mental mechanisms and motivations behind this universal desire. Historians and spiritualists explore the ancient rituals of cultures worldwide that have sought visions and truth through altered consciousness, and illuminate the terrifying, exquisite visions that are revealed to those who journey beyond the constraints of the conscious mind.\n\nFile Size ------- 347mb\nLength ---------- 40:40\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc3101393ed15d6e12d784073435bd27fdb84e5","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Ancient+Drugs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc3101393ed15d6e12d784073435bd27fdb84e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,195,16,19,147,237,21,214,225,45,120,64,115,67,91,210,127,219,132,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
