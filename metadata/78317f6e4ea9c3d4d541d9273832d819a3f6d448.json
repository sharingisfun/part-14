She has fainting fits. Her husband Raoul seeks to save her by enlisting Stephane, a stranger, to be her lover. Although he listens to Mozart and has every Pocket Book arranged in alphabetical order, Stephane fails to cheer Solange. She knits. She does housework. Everyone, including their neighbor a vegetable vendor, agrees that she needs a child, yet she fails to get pregnant by either lover. The three take a job running a kids&amp;#039; summer camp where they meet Christian, the precocious 13-year-old son of the local factory manager. It is Christian who restores Solange to laughter.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078122/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078122/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDivX5 + English Soft Subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78317f6e4ea9c3d4d541d9273832d819a3f6d448","amp;dn":"Get+Out+Your+Handkerchiefs+1978+Bertrand+Blier+Divx+Fr+EN+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78317f6e4ea9c3d4d541d9273832d819a3f6d448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,49,127,110,78,169,195,212,213,65,217,39,56,50,216,25,163,246,212,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
