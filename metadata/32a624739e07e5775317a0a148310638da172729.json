This full collection of these reviews nearly doubles the number that have appeared in print elsewhere and represents a significant body of primary materials from the O'Connor canon. We find in the reviews the same personality so vividly apparent in her fiction and her lectures--the unique voice of the artist that is one clear sign of genius. Her spare precision, her humor, her extraordinary ability to permit readers to see deeply into complex and obscure truths-all are present in these reviews and letters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32a624739e07e5775317a0a148310638da172729","amp;dn":"Flannery+O%27Connor+-+The+Presence+of+Grace+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32a624739e07e5775317a0a148310638da172729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,166,36,115,158,7,229,119,83,23,160,161,72,49,6,56,218,23,39,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
