Led Zeppelin consisted of Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones and John Bonham. With their heavy, guitar-driven sound, Led Zeppelin are regarded as one of the first heavy metal bands. Their rock-infused interpretation of the blues and folk genres also incorporated rockabilly, reggae, soul, funk, jazz, classical, Celtic, Indian, Arabic, pop, Latin, and country. The band did not release the popular songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of album-oriented rock.\n\nMothership is a compilation album by English rock group Led Zeppelin, released by Atlantic Records and Rhino Entertainment on November 12, 2007 in the United Kingdom, and November 13, 2007 in the United States. It was released on the same day that Led Zeppelins entire catalog became available in digital stores, including the iTunes Store. The cover was created by artist Shepard Fairey.\n\nTrack List (Disc 1):\n01 Good Times Bad Times\n02 Communication Breakdown\n03 Dazed And Confused\n04 Babe Im Gonna Leave You\n05 Whole Lotta Love\n06 Ramble On\n07 Heartbreaker\n08 Immigrant Song\n09 Since Ive Been Loving You\n10 Rock And Roll\n11 Black Dog\n12 When The Levee Breaks\n13 Stairway To Heaven\n\nTrack List (Disc 2):\n01 The Song Remains The Same\n02 Over The Hills And Far Away\n03 DYer Maker\n04 No Quarter\n05 Trampled Under Foot\n06 Houses Of The Holy\n07 Kashmir\n08 Nobodys Fault But Mine\n09 Achilles Last Stand\n10 In The Evening\n11 All My Love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eb62eaa57e2e6a2803c346aa6078e96bbed25dd","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Mothership+%5B2007%2FMP3%2FV0+%28VBR%29%2FCue%2FLog%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eb62eaa57e2e6a2803c346aa6078e96bbed25dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,182,46,170,87,226,230,162,128,60,52,106,166,7,142,150,187,237,37,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
