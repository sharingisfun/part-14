I grabbed them off their website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kannal.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kannal.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThey do music festival shows in my area so i took some interest in their works.\n\nFollowing is their own description of themselves:\nKan&amp;#039;Nal Is: Primal rhythm, swirling dancers, ancient instruments and futuristic technologies blend with mythic archetypes and alternative rock to create a musical, visual, sensual experience. Kan&amp;#039;Nal&amp;#039;s &quot;Shamanic Rock,&quot; documented on their Sony Red debut, Dreamwalker, conveys the power of these spectacles.\n\nMy favorite track is Desert Flower. I wish i could get better quality though....\n\nAnyway thanks and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e96fc7b2ab0dbed0d430cf6ef04406e9fdb8a76","amp;dn":"Kan%5C%27Nal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e96fc7b2ab0dbed0d430cf6ef04406e9fdb8a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,150,252,123,42,176,219,237,13,67,12,246,239,4,64,110,159,219,138,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
