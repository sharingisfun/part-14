Munro, better recognized by the pen name Saki, produced works that contrasted the conventions and hypocrisies of Edwardian England with the uncomplicated and sometimes cruel state of nature, a conflict which the latter usually won. This complete edition of short stories will entertain readers with its wonderfully intricate characters, rich political satire and fine narrative style. The book begins with Saki's first works, the &quot;Reginald&quot; stories, a small series of vignettes centered around the societal and cynical young Reginald. Also included are Saki's later and more popular story collections: &quot;Reginald in Russia,&quot; the somewhat macabre tales of &quot;The Chronicles of Clovis,&quot; Saki's best known &quot;Beasts and Super-Beasts,&quot; &quot;The Toys of Peace,&quot; and &quot;The Square Egg.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc01c5eea125d52c312871b9e1456c3d38c92e7","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Short+Stories+-+Saki+%28H.+H.+Munro%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc01c5eea125d52c312871b9e1456c3d38c92e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,192,28,94,234,18,93,82,195,18,135,27,158,20,86,195,211,140,146,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
