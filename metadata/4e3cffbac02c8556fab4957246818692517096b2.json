Under this combined moniker, the group recorded several albums and had a significant international hit single with the song &quot;Arms of Mary&quot; in 1976. In North America they are primarily known for their 1973 debut single &quot;I Don't Want To Love You ( But You Got Me Anyway)&quot;, which was not a hit in the UK\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e3cffbac02c8556fab4957246818692517096b2","amp;dn":"Sutherland+Brothers+%26amp%3B+Quiver+-+Beat+Of+The+Street+%281974%29+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e3cffbac02c8556fab4957246818692517096b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,60,255,186,192,44,133,86,250,180,149,114,70,129,134,146,81,112,150,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
