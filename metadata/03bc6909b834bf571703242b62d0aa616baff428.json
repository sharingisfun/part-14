A crime results in a web of guilt and revenge that knits together the lives of two very different couples. Ex-con Alex plans to help his girlfriend, Tamara, escape from her life in a brothel by robbing a bank in his grandfather's small town. When the plan goes awry, Alex is drawn into a complex relationship with Robert, a local policeman, and his kindhearted wife, Suzanne.\n\nEastern Europe is beautifully filmed. A seemingly quiet and simple countryside is contrasted amazingly to the usual city stereotype of brothels, human trafficking and crime.  The centerpiece in this film though, is definitely the characters.  There is some action. There is some comedy. The ending is SENSATIONAL.   After a somewhat slow beginning the story will hold your interest and never really lag ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it is a worthy movie experience that will in the end leave you satisfied that your time watching it was well spent..\n\nGenre: Crime | Drama | Romance\nIMDB: http://us.imdb.com/title/tt1173745/\nIMDB Rating: 7.6/10   (479 votes)\nLanguage: German and Rusian (English Subtitles)\nRuntime: 121 Minutes\nThis film was shown at a few film festivals in 2008.
