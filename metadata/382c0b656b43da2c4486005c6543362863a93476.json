Ts??) is a 1991 competitive fighting game by Capcom. It is widely credited with launching the fighting game genre into the mainstream and extending the life of the worldwide arcade scene for several years with its unique six button &quot;combo&quot; controls and revolutionary &quot;loser pays&quot; competitive gameplay. Its popularity far eclipsed that of its comparatively obscure predecessor, thanks in part to its inclusion of eight selectable characters (a number which would increase in subsequent updates) with their unique playing style and refinement of the unique play controls featured in the first game, setting the template for future fighting games. Its success also led to the production of several updates of the game (including home versions), as well as merchandising and cross-media adaptations (including two separately produced theatrical films). Street Fighter II was followed by a prequel titled Street Fighter Alpha: WarriorsÃ‚Â´ Dreams and a sequel titled Street Fighter III: New Generation. Both games also inspired their own series of updates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:382c0b656b43da2c4486005c6543362863a93476","amp;dn":"Street+Fighter+2+Turbo+%5BPAL+-+Wii+-+VC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"382c0b656b43da2c4486005c6543362863a93476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,44,11,101,107,67,218,44,68,134,0,92,101,67,54,40,99,169,52,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
