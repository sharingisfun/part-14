Other assinged tasks include a fireman who maintains and looks after the fire in the centre of the tipi, a doorman, a cedarman and a drummer. The meeting lasts until dawn. \nDuring that time a water drum makes its way around the circle of peyote eaters, a person can choose to sing when the drum comes to them. The drummer sits down next to the singer as the drumming begins a rattle joins in from the singer and the songs are sung. \n\nThis is a collection of those peyote songs, some are of better quality than others. \n\nEnjoy. \n\nOver 1.5 hours of songs.
