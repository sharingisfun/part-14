After popluar demand and having such a positive response from the upgrades we decided it was about time to reopen the Total Texture Collection series.\n\nOur NEW Total Texture collection is full of great Showroom Textures for really finishing those Architectural renders to the highest standards with as little effort as possible. As with all Total Texture Collections, the NEW DVD now contains 134 Texture Maps comprising of over 545 individual, hand crafted texture maps which are all fully tileable. Each texture has been hand crafted from 100% original photography, made seamless where required, and each having their own unique bump &amp; specular map included. Each texture is also of course totally flexible and can be used in many projects - architectural or otherwise.&quot;\n\nAll you 3D artists out there, enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f02656ce66828aa534f818ef998f0a9a4bd0f04","amp;dn":"+V16+-+Total+Textures+%5C%22Architectural+Showroom%5C%22+%2Abigfy%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f02656ce66828aa534f818ef998f0a9a4bd0f04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,2,101,108,230,104,40,170,83,79,129,142,249,152,240,169,164,189,15,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
