Designed for the first course or sequence in circuits in electrical engineering, the approach imparts not only an appreciation for the elegance of the mathematics of circuit theory, but a genuine &quot;feel&quot; for a circuit's physical operation. This will benefit students not only in the rest of the curriculum, but in being able to cope with the rapidly changing technology they will face on-the-job. The text covers all the traditional topics in a way that holds students' interest. The presentation is only as mathematically rigorous as is needed, and theory is always related to real-life situations. Franco introduces ideal transformers and amplifiers early on to stimulate student interest by giving a taste of actual engineering practice. This is followed by extensive coverage of the operational amplifier to provide a practical illustration of abstract but fundamental concepts such as impedance transformation and root location control--always with a vigilant eye on the underlying physical basis. SPICE is referred to throughout the text as a means for checking the results of hand calculations, and in separate end-of-chapter sections, which introduce the most important SPICE features at the specific points in the presentation at which students will find them most useful. Over 350 worked examples, 400-plus exercises, and 1000 end-of-chapter problems help students develop an engineering approach to problem solving based on conceptual understanding and physical intuition rather than on rote procedures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56dfb5aa92473464f140ae2a920a560739ceba83","amp;dn":"Electric+Circuits+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56dfb5aa92473464f140ae2a920a560739ceba83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,223,181,170,146,71,52,100,241,64,174,42,146,10,86,7,57,206,186,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
