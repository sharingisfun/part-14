I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if it is as good as what the professional releasers put out, but I used FTPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MP4 as the source and used all of the highest conversion settings (skipping the ones that give standalones problems). I also tried to resize it to be consistent with the 640x360 resolution of the existing XviD episodes, but the closest I could get was 640x358.\n\n(As a side note, if anyone knows of a guide or something of how to do high-quality, consistently-sized releases like the sceners provide, please let me know because the conversions I make with AVIDemux and AutoGK are never satisfactory.)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e551659ae6476d688a4ab59b198cc3a9c616e2e9","amp;dn":"David+Attenborough%26rsquo%3Bs+Africa+-+S01E02+%28%26ldquo%3BSavannah%26rdqu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e551659ae6476d688a4ab59b198cc3a9c616e2e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,81,101,154,230,71,109,104,138,74,181,155,25,140,195,169,198,22,226,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
