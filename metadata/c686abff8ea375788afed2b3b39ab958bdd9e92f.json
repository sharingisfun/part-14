Have fun!\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe Game of the Year edition of The Elder Scrolls IV - Oblivion also contains the expansion packs Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles. Oblivion is the quintessential role-playing game for the next generation and another leap forward in gaming. Step inside the most richly detailed and vibrant game-world ever created. Oblivion is the latest chapter in the epic and highly successful Elder Scrolls saga and utilizes the latest PC and next-generation video game hardware to fully immerse you into the experience. With a powerful combination of freeform gameplay and unprecedented graphics, you can unravel the main quest at your own pace or explore the vast world and find your own challenges.\nAfter the mysterious and untimely death of the Emperor, the throne of Tamriel\nlies empty. With the Empire ready to crumble, the gates of Oblivion open and\ndemons march upon the land-laying waste to everything in their path. To turn\nthe tide of darkness, you must find the lost heir to the throne and unravel\nthe sinister plot that threatens to destroy all of Tamriel.\n\nIn keeping with the Elder Scrolls tradition, players will have the option to experience the main quest at their own pace, and there will be plenty of opportunities to explore the vast world and make your own way. Numerous factions can be joined, such as the thieves or mages guilds, and each contains its own complete storyline and the chance to rise to the head of the faction and reap further rewards.\n\nOblivion is a single-player game that takes place in Tamriel's capital province, Cyrodiil. You are given the task of finding the hidden heir to a throne that sits empty, the previous emperor having been killed byan unknown assassin. With no true Emperor, the gates to Oblivion (the equivalent of hell in the world of Tamriel) open, and demons begin to invade Cyrodiil and attack its people and towns. It's up to you to find the lost heir to the throne and unravel the sinister plot that threatens to destroy all of Tamriel.\n\n\n* Live another life in another world, create and play any character you can imagine\n    \n* An all-new combat and magic system brings first person role-playing to a new level of intensity\n    \n* Groundbreaking AI system gives characters full 24/7 schedules\n    \n* New lands to explore in the Shivering Isles expansion\n    \n* Challenging new foes, hideous insects, Flesh Atronachs, skeletal Shambles, amphibeous Grummites and more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c686abff8ea375788afed2b3b39ab958bdd9e92f","amp;dn":"The+Elder+Scrolls+IV+Oblivion+-+%28GOTY%29+%28PS3%29+%28Jailbreak%29+%28Mods%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c686abff8ea375788afed2b3b39ab958bdd9e92f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,134,171,255,142,163,117,120,138,254,210,179,179,154,185,88,189,217,233,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
