In her life she reconciled aspects of spirituality often seen to be either mutually exclusive or in conflict. This married lay woman was both a mystic and a humanitarian, a constant contemplative, yet daily immersed in the physical care of the sick and the destitute.\n\nFor the last five centuries she has been the inspiration of such spiritual greats as Francis de Sales, Robert Bellarmine, Fenelon, Newman and Hecker. Friedrich von HÃƒÂ¼gel's famous Mystical Element of Religion was a study of the spirituality of Catherine.\n\nPurgation and Purgatory is a collection of sayings on spiritual purification in this life and the next. The Spiritual Dialogue gives us a readable and coherent inner history of Catherine.\n\nLanguage Notes\n\nText: English, Italian (translation)\n\nAbout the Author\n\nThe translation and notes for the volume are by Serge Hughes, Professor of Italian at Hunter College of the City University of New York. Dr. Hughes is best known for his The Fall and Rise of Modern Italy and The Little Flowers of St. Francis.\n\nFr. Benedict J. Groeschel, who authored the Introduction, is Director of the Office for Spiritual Development of the Archdiocese of New York. He teaches pastoral psychology and ascetical-mystical theology at Iona and Fordham, and at St. Joseph's, Immaculate Conception and Maryknoll Seminaries.\n\nThe Preface has been written by Catherine de Hueck Doherty, the founder and Director General of Madonna House. She is author of such well known books as Poustinia and The Gospel Without Compromise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e610c57b44cd8ea5bc8572f5fe8036d1a4eff48","amp;dn":"Catherine+of+Genoa+%28Classics+of+Western+Spirituality%29+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e610c57b44cd8ea5bc8572f5fe8036d1a4eff48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,97,12,87,180,76,216,234,91,200,87,47,95,232,3,109,26,78,255,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
