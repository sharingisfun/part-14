They disbanded in 1988, but reformed again from 2003 to 2008, issuing a new EP in 2007.\n\nThe band's name is a reference to the payola scandal in the United States in the early 1960s. The group was based in Vancouver,Columbia, and recorded mostly at Vancouver's Little Mountain Sound Studios. Through several lineup changes and name changes (the band also played as The Payolas, Paul Hyde and the Payolas and Rock and Hyde), the Payolas core members remained Paul Hyde and Bob Rock, who together wrote virtually all of the band's songs. As well, Rock engineered and mixed virtually every Payolas recording.\n\nAlthough in the 1980s the Payolas always seemed poised for a big international breakthrough, the band never quite broke out despite their artistic growth and popular success in Canada. They were, however, one of the most prominent and successful platinum-selling Canadian bands of the early 1980s.\n\n\nVocalists Paul Hyde and Bob Rock formed the Payolas with drummer Chris Taylor and bassist Larry Wilkins. After &quot;China Boys&quot; was released on their own Slophouse Records, A&amp;M signed the band and released four albums from 1979 to 1985 -- No Stranger to Danger (1982), Hammer on a Drum (1983), In a Place like This (1984) and Here's the World for Ya (1985). After breaking up in 1985, Rock and Hyde continued on, releasing a popular single in 1987 called &quot;Dirty Water.&quot; Paul Hyde left for a solo career in 1989; Bob Rock later joined the band Rockhead. \n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Eyes Of A Stranger\n02.Never Said I Love You\n03.Stuck In The Rain\n04.Soldier\n05.China Boys\n06.I'll Find Another (Who Can Do It Right)\n07.It Must Be Love\n08.Here's The World\n09.Where Is This Love\n10.You're The Only Love\n11.Dirty Water (Rock &amp; Hyde)\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aea0cfd51f1c6690adbfb4a3a896f47e1683f8eb","amp;dn":"The+Payolas+-+The+Best+Of++%282002%29++Mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aea0cfd51f1c6690adbfb4a3a896f47e1683f8eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,160,207,213,31,28,102,144,173,191,180,163,168,150,244,126,22,131,248,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
