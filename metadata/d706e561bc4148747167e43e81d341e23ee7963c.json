Top of the Pops, also known as TOTP, is a music chart television program, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly from 1 January 1964 to 30 July 2006.\n\nEach weekly program consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, every year there was a special edition of the program on Christmas Day featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.\n\n&quot;Lola&quot; is a song written by Ray Davies and performed by The Kinks which details a romantic encounter between a young man and a transvestite he meets in a Soho club in London.\n\nReleased in June 1970, in the UK on the 12th and in the USA on the 28th, the single was taken from the album Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One and reached #2 in the UK charts and #9 in the US. It was ranked 422nd on the List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and its C-D-E power riff is recognized among the famous riffs of rock. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lola_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lola_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KABPOAaDA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KABPOAaDA&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8199kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Media Length: 00:04:04\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
