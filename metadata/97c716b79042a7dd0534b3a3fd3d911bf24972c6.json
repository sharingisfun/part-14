But pop for Chapman isn't all easy-to-digest nuggets. A talented songwriter, she moves in fluid motion between hearty pop, heart-tugging piano balladry, and burnished adult contemporary groove. She flirts with smoky piano jazz on the coy &quot;Dance With Me Slow,&quot; imbues the first-person, fibrous title track with uplifting grace, and sells the smooth Paul Carrack duet &quot;In the Time It Takes&quot; with precision. But she's just as comfortable with the brassy, Bonnie Raitt-style blues-rock of &quot;You Say You Will&quot; or the quietly surging &quot;Faithful Heart,&quot; where violins, harp, pipes, and a reverent choir of voices combine with her own fervent vocal for a truly moving experience. It's all in a day's work for Chapman, a wonderful performer who elevates the few scant weak moments of You Hold the Key with pure talent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97c716b79042a7dd0534b3a3fd3d911bf24972c6","amp;dn":"Beth+Nielsen+Chapman+-+You+Hold+the+Key+%5B1993%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97c716b79042a7dd0534b3a3fd3d911bf24972c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,199,22,183,144,66,167,221,5,52,179,163,253,61,145,27,242,73,114,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
