Grunge music ruled the airwaves during the mid-'90s, but Hootie played a mainstream pop variation of blues-rock, and their easy-going sound netted them a string of Top 40 hits. Formed at the University of South Carolina, the group featured lead vocalist/guitarist Darius Rucker, Mark Bryan, Dean Felber, and Jim &quot;Soni&quot; Sonefeld, and the band's name referred to two mutual friends (not Rucker and the group itself). Cracked Rear View, the quartet's first album, was released in the fall of 1994 and became enormously successful, due in part to the album's first single, &quot;Hold My Hand.&quot; The song had worked its way into the Top Ten by the beginning of 1995, propelling the album to number one and paving the way for three additional Top 20 singles: &quot;Let Her Cry,&quot; &quot;Only Wanna Be With You,&quot; and &quot;Time.&quot; \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.
