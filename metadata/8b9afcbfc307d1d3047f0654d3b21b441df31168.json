(CRC, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nThe Theory and Applications of Nanophotonics Devices, Fabrication, and Systems\r\nCoauthored by the developer of nanophotonics, Principles of Nanophotonics outlines physically intuitive concepts of the subject using a novel theoretical framework that differs from conventional wave optics. It probes far-reaching physical insights into the local electromagnetic interaction in the nanometric subsystem composed of electrons and photons.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the background, history, and current status of research and development in nanophotonics and related technologies, the book presents a unique theoretical model to describe the interactions among nanometric material systems via optical near-fields. It also evaluates a nonadiabatic fabrication process using this theoretical model. The authors then explore nanophotonic devices and fabrication techniques and provide examples of qualitative innovation. The final chapter looks at how the assembly of nanophotonic devices produces a nanophotonic system.\r\n\r\nRealize the Great Potential of Nanophotonics\r\n\r\nNanophotonics is on its way to revolutionizing various applications in devices, fabrications, and information and communication systems. Promoting further exploration in the field, this book helps you understand the theory behind nanophotonics and how it can be applied to devices and systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b9afcbfc307d1d3047f0654d3b21b441df31168","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Nanophotonics+-+Motoichi+Ohtsu+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b9afcbfc307d1d3047f0654d3b21b441df31168","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,154,252,191,195,7,209,211,4,127,6,84,211,178,27,68,29,243,17,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
