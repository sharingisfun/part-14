This sweeping panorama is the sharpest infrared picture ever made of the Galactic core. It offers a nearby laboratory for how massive stars form and influence their environment in the often violent nuclear regions of other galaxies. This view combines the sharp imaging of the Hubble Space Telescope's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) with color imagery from a previous Spitzer Space Telescope survey done with its Infrared Astronomy Camera (IRAC). The Galactic core is obscured in visible light by intervening dust clouds, but infrared light penetrates the dust. The spatial resolution of NICMOS corresponds to 0.025 light-years at the distance of the galactic core of 26,000 light-years. Hubble reveals details in objects as small as 20 times the size of our own solar system. The NICMOS images were taken between February 22 and June 5, 2008.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAbout the Object  \n\t\nObject Name: \t        Galactic Center\nObject Description: \tCenter of the Milky Way Galaxy\nPosition (J2000): \tR.A. 17h 45m 36s.00 Dec. -28Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° 55' 58&quot;.8\nConstellation: \t        Sagittarius\nDistance: \t        26,000 light-years (8 kiloparsecs)\n\nAbout the HST Data \t\nData Description: \tThis image was composited from Hubble and Spitzer data.    ________________________The Hubble component was from the HST proposal 11120: Q.D. ________________________Wang (University of Massachusetts, Amherst), S.
