The map of the world is constantly changing as the boundaries of countries change. The boundaries of old countries crumble, only to form new\nones, yet others merge to form new, larger countries. Wars and conflicts constantly redraw the boundary lines of\nour world map, World War II is perhaps the best example of this.\nIn modern times, technological advances have made us all neighbours. A single touch on the key pad, and people thousands of miles away are right before us in an instant. The world is shrinking to a large village - a global village. Even then geographical boundaries do exist. A better understanding among people about every land, its people, its way of life is definitely a need of the hour.\nThis issue ofTell Me Why takes you to some of the countries of the world. As you know, it is an impossible task to feature all the countries in a single issue, but we have included the maximum number possible. We are planning to publish another title soon, including the remaining countries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4720ec53aa467e06181b2ac38073a2702c0b2305","amp;dn":"Countries+of+the+World+%28Tell+Me+Why+%2363%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4720ec53aa467e06181b2ac38073a2702c0b2305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,32,236,83,170,70,126,6,24,27,42,195,128,115,162,112,44,11,35,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
