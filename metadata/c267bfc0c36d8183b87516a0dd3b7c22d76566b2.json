Kicking off with solo tracks recorded in 1939 and 1944 for the Solo-Art and Commodore labels, the next batch follows him into a small-band format with Hop Lips Page practically stealing the show in his demonstrative style. The final ten selections emanate from Chicago sessions for Mercury -- again with a small group -- featuring vocals from Sippie Wallace and Mildred Anderson. Ammons was a giant in his chosen field of endeavor, and these sides make a marvelous addition to his too-short discography.[/color]\nAlbert Ammons - 1939-1946 {The Chronological Classic} \n\nTracklist:\n\nAlbert Ammons\n\npiano\nRecorded New York 8 April 1939\n\n01.
