The follow-up, 1991&amp;#039;s Gothic, was\nthe band&amp;#039;s breakthrough, its dark production and\norchestral elements setting them apart from the\ncompetition; a major European tour also expanded Paradise\nLost&amp;#039;s fanbase dramatically. Signing with the Music for\nNations label, they returned in 1992 with Shades of God,\nconsidered by many to be their high-water mark; an EP, As\nI Die, appeared later that same year, complete with cover\nart by the incomparable Dave McKean. After 1993&amp;#039;s Icon,\nArcher left Paradise Lost, and was replaced by drummer Lee\nMorris; Draconian Times followed in 1995, with One Second\nreleased two years later.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7240a46f9b08b195bd61fc12915e7a61c919fb53","amp;dn":"Paradise+Lost+-+The+Anatomy+of+Melancholy+-+2CD-2008-JUST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7240a46f9b08b195bd61fc12915e7a61c919fb53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,64,164,111,155,8,177,149,189,97,252,18,145,94,122,97,201,25,251,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
