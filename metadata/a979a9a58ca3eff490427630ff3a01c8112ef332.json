She started to play saxophone at the age of six. She has had her own band, Funky Stuff, since she was fourteen. Her debut album Saxuality (1990) received a Grammy Award nomination. Over the years she released nine studio albums, two live albums, and one compilation album. She has performed and recorded songs with several other musicians, such as her father Hans Dulfer, Prince, Dave Stewart, Van Morrison, Jonathan Butler and Maceo Parker.\n\nAccording to Prince:\n&quot;When I need trombone, my dog is handy.\nBut when I want sax, I call Candy.&quot;\n\nDulfer's debut album, Saxuality, was released later in 1990. With her funky alto sax stylings proving popular with fans of contemporary jazz at several recently launched smooth jazz radio stations in the United States, Saxuality was nominated for a Grammy and certified gold for worldwide sales in excess of half a million. Though Dulfer has had no other pop hits in the U.S., she has had a number of major smooth jazz chart hits, including &quot;For The Love Of You&quot; and &quot;Finsbury Park, Cafe67&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
