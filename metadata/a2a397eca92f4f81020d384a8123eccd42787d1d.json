Vangelis succeeds in capturing the 15th-century mood, mixing rich choral portions with modern elements, and portraying the larger than life character of Columbus, complete with full-range, dynamic sound.\nTracks\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n \t  \t1 Opening\t  \t         1:21\n \t\t2 Conquest of Paradise\t  \t 4:47\n \t  \t3 Monastery of la Rabida\t 3:39\n \t  \t4 City of Isabel\t  \t 2:16\n \t\t5 Light and Shadow\t  \t 3:46\n \t  \t6 Deliverance\t  \t         3:28\n \t\t7 West Across the Ocean Sea\t 2:53\n \t  \t8 Eternity\t  \t         1:59\n \t  \t9 Hispanola\t  \t         4:56\n \t  \t10 Moxica and the Horse\t  \t 7:06\n \t  \t11 Twenty Eighth Parallel\t 5:14\n \t  \t12 Pinta, Nina, Santa Maria (Into Enternity) 13:19\n\t\n\nFrom allmusic.com\n\n\nAlternate dl: ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2a397eca92f4f81020d384a8123eccd42787d1d","amp;dn":"1492+Conquest+Of+Paradise+%281992%29++by+Vangelis+%5B128+AAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2a397eca92f4f81020d384a8123eccd42787d1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,163,151,236,169,47,79,129,2,13,56,74,129,35,236,205,66,120,125,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
