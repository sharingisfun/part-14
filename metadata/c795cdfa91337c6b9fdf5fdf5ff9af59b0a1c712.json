When European colonists began to establish permanent settlements on the eastern flank of North America, they had other things on their minds than the painting of pictures. Faced with a pressing necessity to satisfy their primary life needsÃ¢â‚¬â€food, shelter, clothingÃ¢â‚¬â€they adopted a way of life and a view of the world that was necessarily pragmatic. For them the arts seemed dangerously irrelevant, a distraction from the serious tasks at hand. That pragmatic attitude has characterized American culture from its inception to the present day, and has profoundly affected the trajectory of American art.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c795cdfa91337c6b9fdf5fdf5ff9af59b0a1c712","amp;dn":"American+Painting+-+From+its+beginnings+to+the+Armory+Show+%28Art+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c795cdfa91337c6b9fdf5fdf5ff9af59b0a1c712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,149,205,250,145,51,124,107,159,223,95,223,95,249,175,89,176,161,199,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
