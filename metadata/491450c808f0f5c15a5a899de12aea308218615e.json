Callister, David G. Rethwisch\n\nCallister and RethwischÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering third edition continues to take the integrated approach to the organization of topics.  That is, one specific structure, characteristic, or property type at a time is discussed for all three basic material typesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½viz. metals, ceramics, and polymeric materials.  This order of presentation allows for the early introduction of non-metals and supports the engineerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s role in choosing materials based upon their characteristics.
