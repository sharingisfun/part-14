They were formed in 1988 by Justin Broadrick (guitar, vocals, and programming) and G.C. Green (bass) and disbanded in 2002. Godflesh's innovative music is widely regarded as a foundational influence on industrial metal and post-metal. Broadrick and Green reformed Godflesh in 2010.\n\nIn 1982, Green founded Fall of Because (named after a Killing Joke song) with Paul Neville. Broadrick, who had been playing guitar as a member of Napalm Death, joined the group in mid-1985 as drummer and vocalist. He left the band in 1987. Broadrick then spent a couple of years (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1988) as a member of Head of David. In 1988, he contacted Green about reforming Fall of Because. Justin decided to take over on guitars and they chose to use a drum machine to help out. They also decided to change their name to Godflesh.\n\nGodflesh established a presence in underground music with albums such as Streetcleaner and Pure, which demonstrated the effectiveness of lo-fi production values in heavy music. A brief flirtation with major label Columbia Records in 1994 for Selfless and the Merciless saw the duo take on a more high-end production approach. In 1996 Godflesh released Songs of Love and Hate, which featured the drumming of Bryan Mantia. The next album, Us and Them, released in 1999, saw the group experimenting with a more electronic, drum and bass-oriented sound in which the guitar played a less central role. In 2001 Godflesh released the double album retrospective In All Languages. That same year they released an album of new material, Hymns, which featured the precise drumming of new band member Ted Parsons and brought the band back to its slow and heavy roots while retaining elements of its experiments with electronica and hip hop.\n\nGreen left Godflesh in late 2001. The band announced that Green would be replaced by former Killing Joke and Prong bassist Paul Raven. In the interim, however, Broadrick's thirteen-year relationship with his girlfriend dissolved, and Broadrick suffered a nervous breakdown shortly before departing for a tour of the United States. Broadrick recalls the breakdown as a &quot;real Brian Wilson moment&quot; and said that he &quot;felt paralyzed by the stress, which had been building for several months, and I literally couldn't get out of bed. I was numb and couldn't move, so when the car came to pick me up to take me to the airport, I ran and hid at another friend's house in Birmingham.&quot;\n\nThe canceled tour caused even more problems for Broadrick. Bus companies had been hired; the groups High on Fire and Halo had been booked to support. And everyone who lost money came after Broadrick. He stated: &quot;I was getting death threats from the bus company in L.A.. I lost close to $35,000, which I did not have at all. I was broke and had to sell my house and pay off all my debt on credit cards. I pretty much did nothing for four months besides drink heavily.&quot; On a poster promoting Jesu's first EP Heart Ache, the caption read as follows &quot;Godflesh is dead, long live Jesu.&quot;\n\nOn April 10th 2002, Godflesh disbanded.\n\nIn November 2009, a reunion show was officially announced for the 2010 edition of the Hellfest Summer Open Air (Clisson, France).\n\nGodflesh played at the 2010 Supersonic Festival in Birmingham, UK on 23 October, co-headlining with Swans. They appeared at the 2011 edition of the Roadburn festival at the 013 venue in Tilburg, Holland, where they performed their first album, Streetcleaner, in its entirety.\n\nIn December 2010, Broadrick told Decibel magazine that the band is slowly putting together ideas for a new studio album. He explained, &quot;It's something we're discussing all the time, and I do have bits and pieces of material. But it's something we'd really like to develop. It'd be quite easy to knock out eight to 10 in-character songs and release it as quickly as possible to capitalize on the popularity of the group, but it would feel entirely wrong. If it's another two years until another Godflesh record, so be it. The most important thing is making a record that stands up with the rest of the back catalogue. I do have this in me again, though.&quot;\n\nIn April 2012, Broadrick confirmed in the April/May edition of Rock-a-Rolla magazine that a new album is in the works: &quot;We intend to release a new album, most likely in 2013, and to record it in late 2012. Probably an EP will come before the album. We will be taking our time with this album, we are not taking it 'lightly'.&quot; Godflesh performed as headliners at the 2012 Maryland Deathfest on 25 May 2012. It was their first North American performance in about 17 years.[citation needed] Godflesh released their first new recording in over 12 years through Decibel magazine's Flexi Series, which is a cover version of Slaughter's &quot;F.O.D. (Fuck of Death)&quot;. The flexi disc was included in the November 2013 issue of Decibel.\n\nThe band announced plans for a new mini-album, Decline and Fall, was released on 2 June 2014. A World Lit Only by Fire will follow on 7 October,[ with both releases due on Broadrick's Avalanche Records. The mini-album will include 4 songs and 2 bonus songs on the Japanese edition.\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nJustin Karl Michael Broadrick - guitars, vocals\nBen George Christian Green - bass\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
