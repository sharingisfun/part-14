Reminiscent of Bill CosbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fatherhood, Dad is Fat is sharply observed, explosively funny, and a cry for help from a man who has realized he and his wife are outnumbered in their own home.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nJIM GAFFIGAN is a stand-up comedian and actor with numerous film, television, and stage credits. He lives in Manhattan with his wife, Jeannie, and their five children in a two-bedroom apartment.\n\n\nDad Is Fat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ May 7, 2013\nBook Language: English \nPages: 171\nFile Type: Pdf, Epub, Mobi\nFile Size: 7.7 MB\n\n\nISBN-10: 038534905X\nISBN-13: 978-0385349055","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2786980d9ea0180268c51bfea26e218ab6a58dfe","amp;dn":"Dad+Is+Fat+-+Jim+Gaffigan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2786980d9ea0180268c51bfea26e218ab6a58dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,134,152,13,158,160,24,2,104,197,27,254,162,110,33,138,182,165,141,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
