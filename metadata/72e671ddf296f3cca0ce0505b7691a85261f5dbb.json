Born in Kannapolis, NC, on July 22, 1940, Clinton became interested in doo wop while living in New Jersey during the early '50s. He formed the Parliaments in 1955, based out of a barbershop back room where he straightened hair. The group had a small R&amp;B hit during 1967, but Clinton began to mastermind the Parliaments' activities two years later. Recording both as Parliament and Funkadelic, the group revolutionized R&amp;B during the '70s, twisting soul music into funk by adding influences from several late-'60s acid heroes: Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, and Sly Stone. The Parliament/Funkadelic machine ruled black music during the '70s, capturing over 40 R&amp;B hit singles (including three number ones) and recording three platinum albums.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Atomic Dog\n02.Do Fries Go With That Shake\n03.Loopzilla (Broadcast Version)\n04.R&amp;B Skeletons (In The Closet) (Extended Version)\n05.Quickie\n06.Nubian Nut\n07.Cool Joe\n08.Last Dance\n09.Hey Good Lookin'\n10.Double Oh-Oh\n11.Dog Talk (Feat.
