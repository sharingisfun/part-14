Should we protect the endangered owl or maintain jobs for loggers? This is a unique, anecdote-rich, and articulate program that teaches us to think for ourselves rather than supplying us with easy, definitive answers. Offering concrete guidelines and principles, Kidder enables us to resolve ethical dilemmas and to make the tough choice between what are usually two &quot;right&quot; values.\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/ce2Zat5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/ce2Zat5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/690d/b0f2a2b1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/690d/b0f2a2b1.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a142f5b0d1a176c7326d690d0cf7e32286070631","amp;dn":"How+Good+People+Make+Tough+Choices%3A+Resolving+the+Dilemmas+of+Et","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a142f5b0d1a176c7326d690d0cf7e32286070631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,66,245,176,209,161,118,199,50,109,105,13,12,247,227,34,134,7,6,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
