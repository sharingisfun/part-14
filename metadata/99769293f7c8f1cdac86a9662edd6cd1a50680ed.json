It's easy and inexpensive to mix up effective, nontoxic alternatives using basic kitchen staples Ã¢â‚¬â€ baking soda, vinegar, lemon juice, herbs, and borax Ã¢â‚¬â€ plus a handful of easy-to-find essential oils. Karyn Siegel-Maier offers 150 all-natural recipes for cleaning everything in your home Ã¢â‚¬â€ from bathrooms to bedding, carpets to cabinetry. The formulas are so simple that anyone can make them, but they are at least as effective as the commercial options.
