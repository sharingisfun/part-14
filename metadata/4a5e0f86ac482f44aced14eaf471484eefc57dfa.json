Tales tell of a band that boasts a guitarist to rival Hendrix and a drummer so powerful that the very foundations of venues shake under a Bonham-esque assault wherever they perform. Crowds across the continent have been left in amazement, while Radio One has labelled the band's live performances &quot;awe inspiring&quot;.\n\nThe band under such wide discussion is The Brew; It's Only Rock 'n' Roll Magazine are already hailing them as &quot;the best three piece to come out of the UK in 20 years..\n\nJason Barwick and father/son team Tim and Kurtis Smith began playing together almost five years ago and have steadily expanded their audience through a series of successful tours and TV performances. The band has no defined hierarchy, and don't need one. Each member brings his own incredible asset to the musical experience, whether it's Jason's jaw-dropping guitar artistry, Kurt's explosive drums or Tim's majestic charisma, the band perform as one perfectly synchronised unit.In May this year countries around Europe discovered The Joker, the band's second self-released album. Both the album and its title track shot to number 16 and 10 in the Polish album and singles chart respectively. Jase, Kurt and Tim found themselves suddenly introduced to Europe on a scale they hadn't foreseen, including a string of festival appearances and sponsor deals, playing alongside such legends as Jeff Beck and receiving personal praise from the likes of Chad Smith. They were soon booked to appear at Rockpalast in Cologne and, due to headliner Bonamassa's reluctance to do a TV recording, their entire set was broadcast live on German WDR TV and their rise to European fame leapt across the Rhine.\n\nThe Only band EVER to play the infamous Rockpalast TWICE!\nTHIS IS THE ENCORE SHOW.[size]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.the-brew.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.the-brew.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSupport these hard working guys if you can.
