The tips will enable you to quickly discover how to use Indian spices to nice effect in creating your own dishes, including your own tea and signature spice blends. \n\nThe recipes in Vijay Madavan's Cooking the Indian Way have been so popular with my family and friends that several recipes now number among their favorites. Given a choice, my family would have these dishes every night. Be sure to make large portions when you serve these to your guests -- although the dishes are quite filling, you will be astonished at how quickly they will disappear! \n\nAlthough we initially found this book in a children's section, it is actually the best of the Indian cookbooks we've seen. It includes a nice introduction to regional differences in Indian cooking, and provides some cultural information, as well. \n\nEasy, informative, and delicious, too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f2cc10b19451795dc5d3f8ea9ce36a9124c119f","amp;dn":"Cooking+the+Indian+Way.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f2cc10b19451795dc5d3f8ea9ce36a9124c119f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,44,193,11,25,69,23,149,220,93,63,142,169,206,54,169,18,76,17,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
