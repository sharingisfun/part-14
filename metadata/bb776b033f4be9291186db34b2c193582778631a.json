What can replace Israel and the Jews in God's plan? Certainly not America and not the Church. Nonetheless, well-intentioned denominations seem to have sprouted blinders to their heritage, the very roots of their Christianity. Let us restore the foundation to our Christianity and quit using Grace as an excuse to cast away the Jews and the Promised Land.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nZola Levitt was a Jewish Christian who shared the gospel &quot;through Jewish eyes.&quot; He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to a German Reform Jewish family. Zola accepted Yeshua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ) as his Messiah in 1971. He had held music degrees from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and completed doctoral course work Indiana University. He later received an honorary Th.D. from Faith Bible College in Dallas, Texas. Zola loved music and played the oboe, English horn, recorder and piano","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb776b033f4be9291186db34b2c193582778631a","amp;dn":"Broken+Branches%3A+Has+the+Church+Replaced+Israel%3F+-+Zola+Levitt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb776b033f4be9291186db34b2c193582778631a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,119,107,3,63,75,233,41,17,134,219,52,178,193,147,88,39,120,99,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
