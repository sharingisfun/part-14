Seems alot of cdda type dc rips have \naudio problems like no sound or no music, luckily this was fixed for this rip.\n\nSome later versions of Sega dreamcast consoles supposedly won't allow utopia or copies of games, not sure if this is true but to be on the safe side try to use a console manufactured before october 2000.  You can find the manfacture date\non the bottom of the console on the sticker in fine print just look for it. \n\n\nGame Description:\n\nChuChu Rocket is an action puzzler, designed predominantly as a multi-player game. You have indirect control over mice, and must guide them to the safety of a rocket, and away from a cat. You do this by placing arrows on the ground, which they will follow. The multi-player game is a frantic all-against-all duel, in which each player's mice will only follow instructions of their own colour. You can play this mode on your own against CPU opponents, or take on a series of predefined puzzles.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120% or Discjuggler (Both included in download).\n\nIn Options enable overburn disc in Alcohol or DiscJuggler.
