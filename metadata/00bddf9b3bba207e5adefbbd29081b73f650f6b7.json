It is gaining increasing importance in the era of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbig dataÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ revolution, of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsmart citiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, of crowdsourced data, and of associated applications for viewing and managing data geographically - like Google Maps. This student focused book:\nProvides a selection of practical examples of geocomputational techniques and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhot topicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ written by world leading practitioners.\nIntegrates supporting materials in each chapter, such as code and data, enabling readers to work through the examples themselves.\nChapters provide highly applied and practical discussions of:\n\nVisualisation and exploratory spatial data analysis\nSpace time modelling\nSpatial algorithms\nSpatial regression and statistics\nEnabling interactions through the use of neogeography\nAll chapters are uniform in design and each includes an introduction, case studies, conclusions - drawing together the generalities of the introduction and specific findings from the case study application Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and guidance for further reading.\n\nThis accessible text has been specifically designed for those readers who are new to Geocomputation as an area of research, showing how complex real-world problems can be solved through the integration of technology, data, and geocomputational methods. This is the applied primer for Geocomputation in the social sciences.&quot;\n\nReview:\n&quot;This is a vital primer to what is Ã¢â‚¬ËœBigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ about geocomputation: new data (and lots of them), innovative methods of analysis, new geographic information technologies and, above all, an over-arching rethink of how we represent geography. It provides an important and strategic contribution to contemporary scientific geography and data analytics.&quot;\n-Paul Longley, Professor of Geographic Information Science\n\nThis torrent contains the original retail EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, LIT, and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
