Needless to say, it&amp;#039;s up to you to, literally, drive them out of town. However, that&amp;#039;s trickier than it sounds, thanks to the introduction of new gangs specialising in their own forms of chaos. Plus, you&amp;#039;ve now got to deal with a rival squad of &quot;heavy-handed&quot; police called the Viper division. Thankfully, you&amp;#039;ve got a string of vehicles at your disposal and can leap between planes, hovercraft, jet skis, tanks, trains and helicopters in your pursuit of justice. Other new features include a a &quot;Justice Bar&quot; that helps you to regain strength and prolong missions and a four-player wireless mode for multiplayer pursuits.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/psp/driving/pursuitforceextremejustice/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/psp/driving/pursuitforceextremejustice/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://psp.ign.com/objects/877/877801.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://psp.ign.com/objects/877/877801.html&lt;/a&gt;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPursuit.Force.Extreme.Justice.PAL.PSP-RANT\n\n  Title..........: Pursuit Force Extreme Justice\n  Publisher......: SCEA\n  Developer......: Bigbig Studios\n  Game Type......: Racing\n  Release Date...: 04/12/2007\n  Store Date.....: 07/12/2007\n  Origin.........: PAL\n  Platform.......: PSP\n  Source.........: UMD\n  Files..........: 67x15MB\n\n  Languages..: MULTI 11\n  english, spanish, swedish, french, portugese, finnish (suomi), italian, nederlands, norvegian, deutsch (german) and danish\n\n( My first upload, so please be patient! )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5d701b459562c22053cb2222c13ac474c2fbf47","amp;dn":"Pursuit.Force.Extreme.Justice.PAL.PSP-RANT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5d701b459562c22053cb2222c13ac474c2fbf47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,215,1,180,89,86,44,34,5,60,178,34,44,19,172,71,76,47,191,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
