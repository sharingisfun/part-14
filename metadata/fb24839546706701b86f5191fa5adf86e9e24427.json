(1991)\n\nRecorded during the Brigade tour at the Centrum in Worcester, MA, on November 28, 1990.\n\n\n\nSisters Ann and Nancy Wilson are the creative spark behind Heart, a hard rock group who initially found success in the mid-'70s, only to reach greater heights after engineering a major comeback a decade later. The daughters of a Marine Corps captain, Ann (born June 19, 1950) and Nancy (born March 16, 1954) grew up in both Southern California and Taiwan before the Wilson family settled in Seattle, WA. Throughout their formative years, both were interested in folk and pop music; while Ann never took any formal music lessons as a child (she later learned to play several instruments), Nancy took up guitar and flute. After both sisters spent some time at college, they decided to try their hand as professional musicians, and while Nancy began performing as a folksinger, Ann joined the all-male vocal group Heart. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tCapitol/EMI\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Wild Child\n02.Fallen From Grace\n03.Call Of The Wild\n04.How Can I Refuse\n05.Shell Shock\n06.Love Alive\n07.Under The Sky\n08.The Night\n09.Tall, Dark, Handsome Stranger\n10.If Looks Could Kill\n11.Who Will You Run To\n12.You're The Voice\n13.The Way Back Machine\n14.Barracuda\n\n\n\nSupport the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.
