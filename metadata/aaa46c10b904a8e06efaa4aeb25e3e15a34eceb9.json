By some counts, only 600 of the 6,000 or so languages in the world are 'safe' from the threat of extinction. A leading commentator and popular writer on language issues, David Crystal asks the fundamental question, 'why is language death so important?', reviews the reasons for the current crisis, and investigates what is being done to reduce its impact. This book contains not only intelligent argument, but moving descriptions of the decline and demise of particular languages, and practical advice for anyone interested in pursuing the subject further","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaa46c10b904a8e06efaa4aeb25e3e15a34eceb9","amp;dn":"Language+Death+%282014%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaa46c10b904a8e06efaa4aeb25e3e15a34eceb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,164,108,16,185,4,168,224,110,250,164,174,178,94,62,21,163,78,206,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
