But between conception and execution stood the vastness of space itself, to say nothing of the monumental technological challenges. Homesteading Space, by two of SkylabÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own astronauts and a NASA journalist, tells the dramatic story of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first space station from beginning to fiery end.\n\nHomesteading Space is much more than a story of technological and scientific success; it is also an absorbing, sometimes humorous, often inspiring account of the determined, hardworking individuals who shepherded the program through a near-disastrous launch, a heroic rescue, an exhausting study of Comet Kohoutek, and the lab's ultimate descent into the Indian Ocean. Featuring the unpublished in-flight diary of astronaut Alan Bean, the book is replete with the personal recollections and experiences of the Skylab crew and those who worked with them in training, during the mission, and in bringing them safely home.\n\nISBN-10: 0803236395\nISBN-13: 978-0803236394\n\n2011\nPDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58accf1a59beefc9d278fde7315ddf72418e0aa6","amp;dn":"Homesteading+Space+-+The+Skylab+Story.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58accf1a59beefc9d278fde7315ddf72418e0aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,172,207,26,89,190,239,201,210,120,253,231,49,93,223,114,65,142,10,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
