However, security practitioners have found little reliable, usable information about these new IDS/IPS technologies. In Practical Intrusion Analysis, one of the fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading experts brings together these innovations for the first time and demonstrates how they can be used to analyze attacks, mitigate damage, and track attackers.\n\nRyan Trost reviews the fundamental techniques and business drivers of intrusion detection and prevention by analyzing todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Next, he presents complete explanations of powerful new IDS/IPS methodologies based on Network Behavioral Analysis (NBA), data visualization, geospatial analysis, and more.\n\nWriting for security practitioners and managers at all experience levels, Trost introduces new solutions for virtually every environment. Coverage includes\n\n- Assessing the strengths and limitations of mainstream monitoring tools and IDS technologies\n- Using Attack Graphs to map paths of network vulnerability and becoming more proactive about preventing intrusions\n- Analyzing network behavior to immediately detect polymorphic worms, zero-day exploits, and botnet DoS attacks\n- Understanding the theory, advantages, and disadvantages of the latest Web Application Firewalls\n- Implementing IDS/IPS systems that protect wireless data traffic\n- Enhancing your intrusion detection efforts by converging with physical security defenses\n- Identifying attackersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“geographical fingerprintsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and using that information to respond more effectively\n- Visualizing data traffic to identify suspicious patterns more quickly\n- Revisiting intrusion detection ROI in light of new threats, compliance risks, and technical alternatives\n\nIncludes contributions from these leading network security experts:\n- Jeff Forristal, a.k.a.
