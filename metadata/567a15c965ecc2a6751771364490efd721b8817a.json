I first discovered Clay on CMT. I was touched by the two videos that I saw, and the songs themselves...&quot;This woman and this man&quot; and &quot;My heart will never know&quot;. So I bought this album and loved it. He puts his heart into each and every song. &quot;The Melrose Avenue Cinema Two&quot; is a wonderful story/song. &quot;Boogie till the cows come home&quot; is a terrific upbeat song. You'll find yourself dancing. If you like country in the style of George Strait or John Michael Montgomery, you will love this album. (CD inlay contains photos and lyrics, and opens up into a mini poster of Clay).\n\n\nClay Walker - If I Could Make a Living\nArtist...............: Clay Walker\nAlbum................: If I Could Make a Living\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994\n\nMP3 320cbr\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTracklisting\n\n1.
