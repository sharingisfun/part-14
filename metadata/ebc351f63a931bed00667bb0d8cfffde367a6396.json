What is particularly sad about this is that many of these deaths could easily have been prevented. Although Dr. Garavaglia, or Dr. G, as sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s known to many, could not tell these individuals how to avoid their fates, we can benefit from her experience and profound insight into the choices we make each day.\n\nIn How Not to Die, Dr. G acts as a medical detective to identify the often-unintentional ways we harm our bodies, then shows us how to use that information to live better and smarter. She provides startling tips on how to make wise choices so that we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to see her, or someone like her, for a good, long time.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In Ã¢â‚¬Å“Highway to the Morgue,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we learn the one commonsense safety tip that can prevent deadly accidentsÃ¢â‚¬â€and the reason you should never drive with the windows half open\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Code BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ teaches us how to increase our chances of leaving the hospital aliveÃ¢â‚¬â€and how to insist that everyone caring for you practice the easiest hygiene method around\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everyday DangersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ informs us why neat freaks live longerÃ¢â‚¬â€and the best ways to stay safe in a car during a lightning storm\n\nUsing anecdotes from her cases and a liberal dose of humor, Dr. G gives us her prescription for living a healthier, better, longer lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and unlike many doctorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ orders, this one is surprisingly easy to follow.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/7bb0/e747a900.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/7bb0/e747a900.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc351f63a931bed00667bb0d8cfffde367a6396","amp;dn":"How+Not+to+Die-+Surprising+Lessons+on+Living+Longer%2C+Safer%2C+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc351f63a931bed00667bb0d8cfffde367a6396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,195,81,246,58,147,27,237,0,102,123,176,216,207,255,222,54,122,99,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
