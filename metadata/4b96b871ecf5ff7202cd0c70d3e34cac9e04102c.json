Instead of admitting his guilt, the detective is given an unexpected alibi, but this &quot;solution&quot; only multiplies the emotional complexity and guilt over his partner's death. He's also still got a murder to solve, in addition to the blackmail and framing of an innocent bystander being orchestrated by the man they were chasing. There's also a local detective (Swank) who is conducting her own personal investigation... of his partner's death. Will it all come crashing down on him?  ---  Summary written by greg Dean Scmitz\n\nCast overview, first billed only:\nAl Pacino .... Detective Will Dormer\nMartin Donovan ....
