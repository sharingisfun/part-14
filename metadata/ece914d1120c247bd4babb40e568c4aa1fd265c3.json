V. Pogorelov.  \n\n  Analytical geometry has no strictly defined contents. It is the\n  method but not the subject under investigation, that constitutes the\n  leading feature of this branch of geometry.\n\n  The essence of this method consists in that geometric objects are\n  associated in some standard way with equations (or systems of\n  equations) so that geometric relations of figures are expressed\n  through properties of their equations.\n\n  For instance, in case of Cartesian coordinates any straight line in\n  the plane is uniquely associated with a linear equation ax+by+ c =\n  0.\n\n    The intersection of three straight, lines at one point is\n    expressed by the condition of compatibility of a system of three\n    equations which specify these lines.\n\n    Due to a multipurpose approach to solving various problems, the\n    method of analytic geometry has become the leading method in\n    geometric investigations and is widely applied in other fields of\n    exact natural sciences, such as mechanics and physics.\n\n    Analytical geometry joined geometry with algebra and analysis -\n    the fact which has told fruitfully on further development of\n    these three subject of mathematics.\n\n    The principal ideas of analytical geometry are traced back to the\n    French mathematician, Rene Descartes (1595-1650), who in 1637\n    described the fundamentals of its method in his famous work\n    &quot;Geometric&quot;. \n    What this book is about and whom it is for?\n    \n    The present book, which is a course of lectures, treats the\n    fundamentals of the method of analytic geometry as applied to the\n    simplest geometric objects. It is designed for the university\n    students majoring in physics and mathematics, \n    \n\n  This book was translated from the Russian by Leonid Levant and\n  was first published by Mir Publishers in 1980.\n  \n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  DJVU | 3.1 MB | Pages: 239 |\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\t\n\nTable of Contents\n   \nChapter 1 \nRectangular Cartesian Coordinates In a Plane 11\n\nChapter 2 \nThe Straight Line 32\n\nChapter 3\nConic Sections 55 \n\nChapter 4 \nVectors 87\n\nChapter 5\nRectangular Cartesian Coordinates in Space 106\n\nChapter 6\nA Plane and a Straight Line 119 \n\nChapter 7\nSurfaces of the Second Order (Quadric Surfaces) \n\nChapter 8\nInvestigating Quadric Curves and Surfaces Specified by Equations of\nthe General Form 160 \n\nChapter 9\nLinear Transformations 180\n\nAnswers to the Exercises, Hints and Solutions 211\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ece914d1120c247bd4babb40e568c4aa1fd265c3","amp;dn":"Pogorelov+-+Analytical+Geometry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ece914d1120c247bd4babb40e568c4aa1fd265c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,233,20,209,18,12,36,123,212,186,187,64,229,104,196,170,31,210,101,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
