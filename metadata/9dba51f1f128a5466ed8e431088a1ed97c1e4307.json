Parsson (Author)\n\nPublication Date: March 8, 2011\nThe cover motif is a piece of old German money. It is a Reichsbanknote issued on August 22, 1923 for one hundred million marks. Nine years earlier, that many marks would have been about 5 percent of all the German marks in the world, worth 23 million American dollars. On the day it was issued, it was worth about twenty dollars. Three months later, it was worth only a few thousandths of an American cent. The process by which this occurs is known as inflation.\n\nA few years before, in 1920 and 1921, Germany had enjoyed a remarkable prosperity envied by the rest of the world. Prices were steady, business was humming, everyone was working, the stock market was skyrocketing. The Germans were swimming in easy money. Within the year, they were drowning in it. Until it was all over, no one seemed to notice any connection between the earlier false boom and the later inflationary bust.\n\n\nPaperback: 376 pages\nPublisher: Dog Ear Publishing, LLC (March 8, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1457502666\nISBN-13: 978-1457502668","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dba51f1f128a5466ed8e431088a1ed97c1e4307","amp;dn":"dying+of+money+lessons+of+german+and+american+inflation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dba51f1f128a5466ed8e431088a1ed97c1e4307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,186,81,241,241,40,165,70,110,216,228,49,8,138,30,217,124,30,67,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
