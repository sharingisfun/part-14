But the town he's sent to is an isolated outpost of mud huts, surrounded by landmines; the hospital, for which he's to be the only doctor, is filled with malnourished children and conditions he's never seen; and the health workersÃ¢â‚¬â€Angolan war veterans twice his age who speak no EnglishÃ¢â‚¬â€walk out on him following an altercation on his first shift. In the months that follow, Damien confronts these challenges all the while dealing with the social absurdities of living with only three other volunteers for company. The medical calamities pile upÃ¢â‚¬â€including a leopard attack, a landmine explosion, and having to perform surgery using tools cleaned on the fireÃ¢â‚¬â€but it's through Damien's evolving friendships with the local people that his passion for the work grows. This heartbreaking and honest account of life on the medical frontline in Angola, Mozambique, and South Sudan is a moving testimony of the work done by medical humanitarian groups and the extraordinary and sometimes eccentric people who work for them.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78c0dba2f4969a486c877002dfa06b577683b07f","amp;dn":"Band-Aid+for+a+Broken+Leg%3A+Being+a+Doctor+with+No+Borders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78c0dba2f4969a486c877002dfa06b577683b07f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,192,219,162,244,150,154,72,108,135,112,2,223,160,107,87,118,131,176,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
