It features an array of highly challenging instrumentals such as &quot;Echidna's Arf (Of You)&quot;, &quot;Don't You Ever Wash That Thing?&quot;, and the opening theme of &quot;Be-Bop Tango (of the Old Jazzmen's Church)&quot;. It also features &quot;Cheepnis&quot;, Zappa's tribute to low-budget monster movies, and reworks of earlier tracks such as &quot;More Trouble Every Day&quot; and &quot;Son of Orange County&quot; (excerpted from the song &quot;Oh No&quot; and given an extended guitar solo). &quot;Village of the Sun&quot; is about Sun Village, California, an unincorporated area near Palmdale, and also makes references to Lancaster, California, twin city to Palmdale and Zappa's hometown.\n\n(from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_%26_Elsewhere)\n\nTrack listing:\n\n\n   01. &quot;Penguin in Bondage&quot; 6:48\n   02. &quot;Pygmy Twylyte&quot; 2:13\n   03. &quot;Dummy Up&quot; 6:02\n   04. &quot;Village of the Sun&quot; 4:17\n   05. &quot;Echidna's Arf (Of You)&quot; 3:52\n   06. &quot;Don't You Ever Wash That Thing?&quot; 9:40\n   07. &quot;Cheepnis&quot; 6:33\n   08. &quot;Son of Orange County&quot; 5:53\n   09. &quot;More Trouble Every Day&quot; 6:00\n   10. &quot;Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)&quot; 16:41\n\nMusicians:\n\n    * Frank Zappa: guitar, vocals, producer\n    * Napoleon Murphy Brock: flute, saxophone, tenor saxophone, vocals\n    * Robert &quot;Frog&quot; Camarena: backing vocals (&quot;Cheepnis&quot;)\n    * Debbie: backing vocals (&quot;Cheepnis&quot;)\n    * Lynn: backing vocals (&quot;Cheepnis&quot;)\n    * Ruben Ladron de Guevara: backing vocals (&quot;Cheepnis&quot;)\n    * George Duke: synthesizer, keyboards, vocals\n    * Bruce Fowler: trombone, dancer\n    * Tom Fowler: bass guitar\n    * Walt Fowler: trumpet, bass trumpet\n    * Ralph Humphrey: drums\n    * Don Preston: synthesizer\n    * Jeff Simmons: rhythm guitar, vocals\n    * Chester Thompson: drums\n    * Ruth Underwood: percussion\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:189085dfdb8593d1aecce90d407a11b5cc0df233","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+1974+-+Roxy+%26+Elsewhere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"189085dfdb8593d1aecce90d407a11b5cc0df233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,144,133,223,219,133,147,209,174,204,233,13,64,122,17,181,204,13,242,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
