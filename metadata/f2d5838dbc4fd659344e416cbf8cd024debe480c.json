In \nExit Ghost, this master author crafts what may be the final chapter in \nthe story of his beloved hero Nathan Zuckerman. After 11 years of \nisolation in his New England mountain refuge, Zuckerman returns to New \nYork City and makes three important connections that threaten his \ncarefully protected sense of isolation.\n\n\nAmazon.com Review\n\nThe last ordeal of Nathan Zuckerman, the indomitable literary adventurer \nof Roth\\'s nine Zuckerman books, like Rip Van Winkle returning to his \nhometown to find that all has changed, Nathan Zuckerman comes back to \nNew York, the city he left eleven years before. Alone on his New England \nmountain, Zuckerman has been nothing but a writer: no voices, no media, \nno terrorist threats, no women, no news, no tasks other than his work \nand the enduring of old age.\n\nWalking the streets like a revenant, he quickly makes three connections \nthat explode his carefully protected solitude. One is with a young \ncouple with whom, in a rash moment, he offers to swap homes. They will \nflee post-9/11 Manhattan for his country refuge, and he will return to \ncity life. But from the time he meets them, Zuckerman also wants to swap \nhis solitude for the erotic challenge of the young woman, Jamie, whose \nallure draws him back to all that he thought he had left behind: \nintimacy, the vibrant play of heart and body.\n\nThe second connection is with a figure from Zuckerman\\'s youth, Amy \nBellette, companion and muse to Zuckerman\\'s first literary hero, E. I. \nLonoff. The once irresistible Amy is now an old woman depleted by \nillness, guarding the memory of that grandly austere American writer who \nshowed Nathan the solitary path to a writing vocation.\n\nThe third connection is with Lonoff\\'s would-be biographer, a young \nliterary hound who will do and say nearly anything to get to Lonoff\\'s \n\\&quot;great secret.\\&quot; Suddenly involved, as he never wanted or intended to be \ninvolved again, with love, mourning, desire, and animosity, Zuckerman \nplays out an interior drama of vivid and poignant possibilities.\n\nHaunted by Roth\\'s earlier work The Ghost Writer, Exit Ghost is an \namazing leap into yet another phase in this great writer\\'s insatiable \ncommitment to fiction.\n\n\n* A New York Times Notable Book of the Year\n\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n&gt;&gt;Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d5838dbc4fd659344e416cbf8cd024debe480c","amp;dn":"EXIT+GHOST+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d5838dbc4fd659344e416cbf8cd024debe480c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,213,131,141,188,79,214,89,52,78,65,108,191,140,208,36,222,190,72,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
