With strong assistance from pianist John Bunch, guitarist Chris Flory, bassist Phil Flanigan and drummer Chuck Riggs, Braff and Hamilton are a perfect team on such joyful swing tunes as &quot;A Sailboat in the Moonlight,&quot; &quot;'Deed I Do,&quot; &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; and &quot;Sweethearts on Parade.&quot; All eight selections (even the obscure &quot;Milkman's Matinee&quot;) are well wotth hearing, making this a highly recommended set. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - A Sailboat in the Moonlight\n02 - Lover Come Back to Me\n03 - Where Are You\n04 - 'Deed I Do\n05 - When Lights Are Low\n06 - Jeepers Creepers\n07 - The Milkman's Matinee\n08 - Sweethearts on Parade\n\nEnjoy and share!
