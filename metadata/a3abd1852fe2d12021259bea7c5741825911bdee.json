It was the only Queen album to reach No. 1 in the US and became Queen's best selling studio album in the US with four million copies sold to date, tying News of the World's US sales tally. The album received very favourable reviews. Notable songs on the album include the bass-driven &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; and the rockabilly &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, both of which reached No. 1 in the US. The Game was the first Queen album to use a synthesiser (an Oberheim OB-X).\n\nThe album features a more pop/rock sound than its predecessor, Jazz. The album's style would be augmented on Queen's next release Hot Space, and future Queen albums. At approximately 35 minutes 39 seconds, The Game is the 2nd shortest of Queen's studio albums, with their subsequent soundtrack for the film Flash Gordon being shorter by 39 seconds. It is estimated to have sold 12 million copies worldwide, including over 4.5 million in the United States.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Play the Game&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury \t3:30\n02. \t&quot;Dragon Attack&quot;   \tBrian May \t4:18\n03. \t&quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;   \tJohn Deacon \t3:35\n04. \t&quot;Need Your Loving Tonight&quot;   \tDeacon \t2:50\n05. \t&quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;   \tMercury \t2:44\n06. \t&quot;Rock It (Prime Jive)&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t4:33\n07. \t&quot;Don't Try Suicide&quot;   \tMercury \t3:52\n08. \t&quot;Sail Away Sweet Sister&quot;   \tMay \t3:33\n09. \t&quot;Coming Soon&quot;   \tTaylor \t2:51\n10. \t&quot;Save Me&quot;   \tMay \t3:50\n\n2011 Bonus EP\n\n01. \t&quot;Save Me (Live in Montreal, November 1981)&quot;   \t4:18\n02. \t&quot;A Human Body (B-Side)&quot;   \t3:44\n03. \t&quot;Sail Away Sweet Sister (Take 1 with guide vocal)&quot;   \t2:34\n04. \t&quot;It's a Beautiful Day (Original spontaneous idea)&quot;   \t1:31\n05. \t&quot;Dragon Attack (Live in Milton Keynes, June 1982)&quot;   \t5:15\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3abd1852fe2d12021259bea7c5741825911bdee","amp;dn":"Queen+-+The+Game+%5Bwith+BONUS+EP%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3abd1852fe2d12021259bea7c5741825911bdee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,171,209,133,47,226,209,32,33,37,155,234,124,87,65,130,89,17,189,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
