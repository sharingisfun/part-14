Written (sort of) and Narrated by Richard Wilson.\n\nCelebrity autobiographies are everywhere. Richard Wilson has always said he'd never write one. Now he has. And it's all true... or is it?\n\nHe narrates the series, weaving in and out of dramatised scenes from his fictional life-story. He plays a heavily exaggerated version of himself: a Scots actor and national treasure, unmarried, private, passionate about politics, theatre and Manchester United (all true), who's a confidant of the powerful and has survived childhood poverty, a drunken father, years of fruitless grind, too much success, monstrosity, addiction, charity work, secret work for governments and fierce rivalry with Sean Connery (not true). All the melodramatic staples of celebrity-autobiography are wonderfully undercut by Richard's deadpan delivery.\n(The title - in case you hadn't spotted - is an unashamed reference to his famous catchphrase.)\n\nRichard is supported by a small core cast viz:\nDavid Tennant\nJohn Sessions\nLewis Macleod\nArabella Weir\nAnd Jane Slavin\nWho play anyone and everyone!\n\nGhost written by Jon Canter\nProduced by: Clive Brill\nA Pacificus Production for BBC Radio 4.\n\nEpisode 1: Drink\n\nWhy does Richard Wilson get drunk every 25th November?\n\nEpisode 2: Rivals\n\nDid you know Sean Connery was offered the part of Victor Meldrew, before Richard Wilson?\n\nEpisode 3: Boots\n\nRichard Wilson reveals why he sleeps with a pair of miners' boots by the bed.\n\nEpisode 4: Power\n\nDoes power drive you mad? Richard Wilson knows. So do Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:442d8ac89743c1df38fcea7e9942764c1fa8268d","amp;dn":"Richard+Wilson+-+Believe+It%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"442d8ac89743c1df38fcea7e9942764c1fa8268d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,45,138,200,151,67,193,223,56,252,234,126,153,66,118,76,31,168,38,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
