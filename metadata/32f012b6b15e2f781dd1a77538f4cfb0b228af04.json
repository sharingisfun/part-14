This quality dramatic motion picture portrays the inspirational true life story of Robert Sheffey, a circuit riding preacher during the 1800's. The film tells the story of a unique servant of God, who as a rowdy young man followed his friends to a revival meeting and there found in the Scriptures new direction for his life. The film begins with the conversion of a young Sheffey and follows his life as he rides through the Appalachain mountains proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ. Although he suffers the loss of his two greatest earthly treasures in one day, Sheffey still finds forgiveness in his heart for the person who caused his sorrow. Based on the book The Saint of the Wilderness by Jess Carr, Sheffey brings hope, courage, joy, and tears. It captures the warmth and compassion of a man whose soul was on fire for the Lord, and, in the words of Bob Jones III, &quot;Every Christian who sees this film will be warmed by that heavenly heat.&quot;\n\nIt is a well produced drama that shows what one person can do if they are fully committed to Jesus Christ and His word. Sheffey was a man of prayer, tireless worker, soul winner, and had a servant's heart of love which is clearly demonstrated in this film. It's a great story for the family and one you'll enjoy over and over.\n\nFor more information please visit: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.christianbook.com/sheffey-dvd/9781591660057/pd/199646&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.christianbook.com/sheffey-dvd/9781591660057/pd/199646&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sheffey-DVD/dp/B000OEMMBM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sheffey-DVD/dp/B000OEMMBM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRuntime: 2 hrs 49 mins\nLanguage: English (No-Subtitles)\nYear: 1978\nMy Rating: 10/10\nQuality: 10/10 \n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business.
