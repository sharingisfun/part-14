Tensions between Russia and the United States are running at a record high, due to a conflict that has been running for the past six years. On top of all this, China is also on the brink of war as Admiral Cheng, plans to overthrow China's current government, if successful, the Russian will have full support from the Chinese, bringing China into a war with the United States. The player controls Sgt. Daniel Recker, a member of a US special operations squad callsigned &quot;Tombstone&quot;. His teammates include squad leader SSgt. Dunn, second-in-command SSgt. Kimble &quot;Irish&quot; Graves, and Marine Combat Lifesaver Clayton &quot;Pac&quot; Pakowski. Later in the Campaign, a CIA field operative named Laszlo W. Kovic joins Tombstone. The player will also meet Huang &quot;Hanna&quot; Shuyi, a female American soldier of Chinese descent.\n\nThe Battlefield 4 gameplay reveal trailer features footage from the prologue mission &quot;Fishing in Baku&quot;, where Tombstone Squad, carrying intelligence from a defecting Russian general, escapes from Baku, Azerbaijan with Russian special forces in hot pursuit. Afterwards, Tombstone squad is sent on a covert mission to Shanghai, to rescue a group of VIPÃ‚Â´s, Kovic among them. Another revealed mission, &quot;Angry Sea&quot;, shows Recker, Irish, Pac, and Kovic trying to escape from a sinking aircraft carrier en route to Singapore with more intel, while fighting off Chinese forces. The campaign's main plot involves American implication in the assassination of China's future leader and &quot;voice of peace&quot;, Jin JiÃƒÂ©, and the threat of a third world war between the United States, China, and Russia.\n\nSystem requirements\nDual core CPU (Intel Core i5 or AMD Ã¢â‚¬Å“BulldozerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\nAt least 4 GB main system memory\nGraphics card with at least 512 MB of VRAM and support for DirectX 10\n30+ GB of harddrive space\nWindows Vista[/color]\n30+ GB of free HDD space\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b995514eef80206e8fb0cafd67bf3f3e2b2eea2","amp;dn":"Battlefield+4+%5B-+PATCH+-%5D+RELOADED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b995514eef80206e8fb0cafd67bf3f3e2b2eea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,153,85,20,238,248,2,6,232,251,12,175,214,123,243,243,226,178,238,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
