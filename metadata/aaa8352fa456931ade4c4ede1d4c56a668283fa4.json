The film follows the band on the first leg of their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour between February and March 2008, during which they travelled on their own customised Boeing 757, Ed Force One, which used the call-sign &quot;666&quot;.\n\nFlight 666 is co-produced by Toronto-based Banger Films, Inc, known for their documentaries Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, Global Metal and Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage. The film was shot in high-definition video with accompanying 5.1 surround sound produced by Kevin Shirley (who has worked with the band since their 2000 album Brave New World). It was distributed by Arts Alliance Media and EMI (except in the US, where it was sub-distributed by D&amp;E Entertainment) in select digital theatres on 21 April 2009.\n\nIron Maiden: Flight 666 documents the opening leg of the band's Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, which took place between February and March 2008. During this leg of the tour, the group travelled 50,000 miles (encompassing India, Australia and North and South America) in just 45 days, performing 23 shows in 13 countries to half a million fans.  To achieve this, the band travelled in their own Boeing 757, nicknamed &quot;Ed Force One&quot; after the band's mascot, Eddie, which was specially converted to carry the band, their crew and twelve tonnes of equipment.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1 \t\n\n1. \t&quot;Churchill's Speech&quot;   \t  \t\t0:43\n2. \t&quot;Aces High&quot; (from Powerslave, 1984) \t4:49\n3. \t&quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot; (from Powerslave, 1984) \t5:57\n4. \t&quot;Revelations&quot; (from Piece of Mind, 1983) \t6:28\n5. \t&quot;The Trooper&quot; (from Piece of Mind, 1983) \t4:01\n6. \t&quot;Wasted Years&quot; (from Somewhere in Time, 1986) 5:07\n7. \t&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (from The Number of the Beast, 1982) 5:07\n8. \t&quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; (from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\t3:36\n9. \t&quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (from Powerslave, 1984) 13:41\n\nDisc 2 \t\n\n1. \t&quot;Powerslave&quot; (from Powerslave, 1984) \tDickinson \t7:28\n2. \t&quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (from Somewhere in Time, 1986) \t7:35\n3. \t&quot;Run to the Hills&quot; (from The Number of the Beast, 1982) 3:59\n4. \t&quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; (from Fear of the Dark, 1992) \t\t7:32\n5. \t&quot;Iron Maiden&quot; (from Iron Maiden, 1980) \t5:26\n6. \t&quot;Moonchild&quot; (from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, 1988) \t7:29\n7. \t&quot;The Clairvoyant&quot; (from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, 1988)4:38\n8. \t&quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; (from The Number of the Beast, 1982) \t7:52","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaa8352fa456931ade4c4ede1d4c56a668283fa4","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Flight+666+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaa8352fa456931ade4c4ede1d4c56a668283fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,168,53,47,164,86,147,26,222,76,78,222,29,76,86,166,104,40,63,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
