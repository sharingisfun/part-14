To explain things:\nDRM was in conflict with our own exe file and that caused everything. We came to an agreement with GG to drop the whole protection and release the unprotected version. Here's the exe file. GG will be releasing the unprotected version tomorrow.\n\nThis is a quick fix. It is rudimentary but simple\n*unzip the folder\n*copy the exe to your game root directory over the original exe file\n*play and have fun\n\nThank you once again for your patience and help. Thank you!\n\n\nlink: spacesimcentral[DOT]com. (you know it's unofficial)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is DRM and bug free one. Buggy DRM free is mostly likely, though.\n\n- No need of crack.\n- No crash for the Main Campaign. (Checked myself)\n- One of my save game caused crash but it's all gone now.\n\n\nUpload in here is to prevent his file downloaded 9,999,999 times (there's dl counter) whilst their game sold only 9,999 copies.\n\n\nIf you found any viruses, uninstall your AV or format your rig. Trust me.\nCheck the included HASH.TXT. Just in case.\n\n\nName:\tStarpointGemini.exe\n--------\nSHA-1:\t2354c6a65aecbd56bda40ef8c2782d6e16c36189\nMD5:\t94871959308b3509939e488d48b540b6\nCRC32:\t509dc01d\n\n\nWritten in English-ish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3d21738f97c88e6bdb43e5c9afe29a8d284ff19","amp;dn":"Starpoint+Gemini+-+Official+Quick+Fix+%28v1.002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3d21738f97c88e6bdb43e5c9afe29a8d284ff19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,210,23,56,249,124,136,230,189,180,62,92,154,254,41,168,210,132,255,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
