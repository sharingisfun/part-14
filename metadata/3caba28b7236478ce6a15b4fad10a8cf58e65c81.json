The plot progresses to a point of no return and a major battle takes place. Jonathan Hickman and Mike Costa wrap a plot tighter than they ever have before. This is the bursting point of the first arc and Di Amorim magnificently brings it to life. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been following this series you absolutely cannot miss this issue, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be holding your breath until you read the last words.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3273107/review-god-is-dead-5/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=review-god-is-dead-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3273107/review-god-is-dead-5/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=review-god-is-dead-5&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3caba28b7236478ce6a15b4fad10a8cf58e65c81","amp;dn":"God+is+Dead+005+%28Avatar+Press%29%282014%29%28Darkness-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3caba28b7236478ce6a15b4fad10a8cf58e65c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,171,162,139,114,54,71,140,230,161,91,79,173,16,168,207,88,230,92,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
