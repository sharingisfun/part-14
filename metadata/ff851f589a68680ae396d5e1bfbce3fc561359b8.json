Malik is driven by a hunger for\n                justice. He was twelve and at the till, when a masked \n                gunman held up the family shop. Malik refused to hand \n                over the money. His father was shot and injured. Since \n                he joined the Force, Malik has been looking for the \n                shadowy figure who pulled the trigger. \n\n                When he finally finds him, MalikÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s belief in the justice \n                system is challenged by a powerful desire for revenge. \n                As he hunts down the truth it is revealed that Crowley \n                had a part to play in the original investigation. But \n                will Crowley help or hinder Malik in his quest? He is a\n                man whose vision has been blighted by pain and prejudice.\n                \n                CrowleyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s son, Paul, was found dead of a drug overdose \n                sold to him by a Lebanese dealer. When the drug dealer,\n                who sold Paul the heroin, is found murdered, Internal \n                Affairs come asking questions. Looking for answers. \n                Not just from Crowley. Malik also. He was involved in the\n                case. Crowley is at the mercy of Malik. Will Malik end \n                his career? What will Crowley do to stop him? \n                \n                ThereÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s an edge of danger as these two men circle one \n                another. This might look like the battle between two \n                strong men for dominance - but it is also a metaphor for \n                the fear that exists between East and West - as two men \n                search for love, approval and forgiveness.\n\nIMDB Rating...: 7.9/10 from 133 users  \n\nLink..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907831/\n\n\nRELEASE NAME..: East.West.101.S01.DVDRip.x264-AUS\nRELEASE DATE..: 01.31.2012\nRUNTiME.......: 312mins\nSiZE..........: 2.51 GB\nViDEO CODEC...: x264, 2-pass, L3.1\nFRAMERATE.....: 25 fps\nBiTRATE.......: 1024 Kbps\nRESOLUTiON....: 720x400 (AR: 16.9)\nAUDiO.........: English, AAC LC 128Kbps Dolby Pro II\nSUBTiTLES.....: None\nSOURCE........: DVD9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff851f589a68680ae396d5e1bfbce3fc561359b8","amp;dn":"East.West.101.S01.DVDRip.x264-AUS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff851f589a68680ae396d5e1bfbce3fc561359b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,133,31,88,154,104,104,10,227,150,213,225,191,188,227,252,86,19,89,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
