The themes, as with The New Gods, are very much about tyranny, mechanization, dehumanization.\n\nThe Hunger Dogs is often confused and muddled, but whether that's a fault of editorial interference, or Kirby's own creative impulses, is hard to say.  In that weird, hit and miss, slightly mad Kirby way, there can be a genuine power to the Hunger Dogs.  The story is suffused with a bleak melancholy, an apocalyptic aura, a sense this really was Kirby's swan song with the property -- and he meant it.  Like the best of Kirby's New Gods run, there are richly dramatic moments, some quite powerful, and a sense that he really is pouring out his heart and soul, that the themes aren't merely pseudo-pretensions to jazz up the action scenes.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d147a2db304188a13877b6b34f4983c270babc","amp;dn":"The+Hunger+Dogs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d147a2db304188a13877b6b34f4983c270babc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,209,71,162,219,48,65,136,161,56,119,182,179,79,73,131,194,112,186,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
