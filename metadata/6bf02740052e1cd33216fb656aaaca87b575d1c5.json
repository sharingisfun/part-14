You're a robot who has been trapped in some sort of prison-like facility and you need to escape. That's all you know. There is no exposition at allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½largely because there is no actual dialog in the gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½so the bits of story you do pick up throughout the adventure are sparse but meaningful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bf02740052e1cd33216fb656aaaca87b575d1c5","amp;dn":"Machinarium+english+.dmg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bf02740052e1cd33216fb656aaaca87b575d1c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,240,39,64,5,46,28,211,50,22,251,101,106,170,202,135,181,117,209,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
