When Winston the local poacher and handyman is thrown out by his wife he invites himself to stay with them.\n\n\nCast:\nMaurice Denham\nShirley Dixon\nLiz Goulding\nChristian Rodska\nBill Wallis\n\nWritten by Peter Tinniswood\n\n\nWinston - S01 - E01 - A Happy Family\nWinston - S01 - E02 - Weaving The Spells\nWinston - S01 - E03 - Without A Doubt\nWinston - S01 - E04 - What Do You Reckon\nWinston - S01 - E05 - Whacko Jolly Dee\nWinston - S01 - E06 - The Village Fete\n\nWinston Comes To Town - S01 - E01 - A Tweak Of Thread\nWinston Comes To Town - S01 - E02 - Line Of Communication\nWinston Comes To Town - S01 - E03 - Has Anyone Seen Winston\nWinston Comes To Town - S01 - E04 - Repeat After Me\nWinston Comes To Town - S01 - E05 - Easy To Love\nWinston Comes To Town - S01 - E06 - The Best Place For Them\n\nWinston In Love - S01 - E01 - I'm In Love, I'm In Love\nWinston In Love - S01 - E02 - Taking Tea With Roland\nWinston In Love - S01 - E03 - Happy Days In Cawnpore\nWinston In Love - S01 - E04 - A Dangerous Critter\nWinston In Love - S01 - E05 - Figuratively Speaking\nWinston In Love - S01 - E06 - Clip Clop, Clip Clop\nWinston In Love - S01 - E07 - Winston At Christmas\n\nWinston In Europe - S01 - E01 - Don't Gush, Nancy\nWinston In Europe - S01 - E02 - An Educated Woman\nWinston In Europe - S01 - E03 - Where Are We Now\nWinston In Europe - S01 - E04 - Coping With Urges\nWinston In Europe - S01 - E05 - Questions And Answers\nWinston In Europe - S01 - E06 - Finis\n\nWinston Back Home - S01 - E01 - So This Is What Happiness Is All About\nWinston Back Home - S01 - E02 - A Whale of A Time With Chekhov\nWinston Back Home - S01 - E03 - Don't Call Me Soams\nWinston Back Home - S01 - E04 - Say It Again, Winston\nWinston Back Home - S01 - E05 - A Born Natural\nWinston Back Home - S01 - E06 - After All This Time A Happy Ending \n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n. \n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81058bab3d2c968aef5066bbf17ecb9283bce3ff","amp;dn":"Peter+Tinniswood+-+Winston+-+Audio+Comedy+-+128K+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81058bab3d2c968aef5066bbf17ecb9283bce3ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,5,139,171,61,44,150,138,239,80,102,187,241,126,203,146,131,188,227,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
