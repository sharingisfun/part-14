Presented as graphically violent parables, these infamous folk tales contain moral lessons that fluctuate from the obvious to the obscure. But told through the medium of comic book storytelling, these literary classics employ their often fatal, gruesome, authentic conclusions such as the horrific death of Cinderella&amp;#039;s stepsisters by pecking birds. Included in this massive volume are the enchanting tales of Snow White, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, and Rumplestiltskin.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=1507&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=1507&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9905814e5a1ae7cf4a7f65517dbe93d1dc4f984","amp;dn":"The+Big+Book+Of+Grimm+-+Comics+-+Written+by+various+%26+Art+by+var","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9905814e5a1ae7cf4a7f65517dbe93d1dc4f984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,144,88,20,229,161,174,124,244,167,246,85,23,219,233,61,29,196,249,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
