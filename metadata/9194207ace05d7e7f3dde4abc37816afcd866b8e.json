The film was written by William Hjortsberg, produced by Arnon Milchan, directed by Ridley Scott and released domestically by Universal Studios.\n\nAfter a disappointing test screening with Jerry GoldsmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original orchestral score, Scott decided to make changes and improve the film. Sidney Sheinberg, president of MCA (the parent company of Universal at the time) felt that the Goldsmith score would not appeal to the youth and pressed Scott for a new score. Tangerine Dream was contracted to complete a new, more contemporary scoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a job they completed in three weeks. Until 2002, only European audiences could see Legend with GoldsmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s score.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLoved By The SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a vocal version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnicorn ThemeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with vocals written and sung by Jon Anderson of Yes. The vocals were added after Tangerine Dream had composed the instrumental music. It was originally recorded with vocals by Susanne Pawlitzki based on William BlakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s poem, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe AngelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, but was rejected in favor of the Jon Anderson version. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnicorn ThemeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has been played live at several concerts in various versions. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIs Your Love Strong Enough?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, played over the end credits, has vocals written and sung by Bryan Ferry with guitar by David Gilmour and bass by Guy Pratt, and is a former out-take of the recording sessions for Avalon, the eighth and last Roxy Music album. All of the other tracks are Tangerine Dream instrumentals. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIs Your Love Strong Enough?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was also released as a 12&quot; single, and included an extended version of the same song and an instrumental, both not available on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLegendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9194207ace05d7e7f3dde4abc37816afcd866b8e","amp;dn":"Tangerine+Dream+-+Legend+%281986%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9194207ace05d7e7f3dde4abc37816afcd866b8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,148,32,122,206,5,215,231,243,221,228,171,195,120,22,175,205,134,107,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
