Game was patched to v. 2.00.11 - the latest one.\nGSM (German Soldiers Mod) is a best, freeware german mod, for original MoW and AS. It totaly changes mechanics of play,add 3 new factions, add LOTS of new units... Well, loook to modder's wibsite. Last version - 6.5\nBy the way, the mod may be plugged optionally, you also can play in original game.\n\nCheers!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f19ac4b380c3872eed11e22e00ad98749f5eec6f","amp;dn":"MoW%3A+Assault+Squad+2.00.11+%2B+5+DLC+%2B+GSM+mod+6.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f19ac4b380c3872eed11e22e00ad98749f5eec6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,154,196,179,128,195,135,46,237,17,226,46,0,173,152,116,159,94,236,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
