Heilbroner ^ azw3 ebook\r\n\r\n368 pages\r\nPublisher: W. W. Norton &amp; Company; Revised ed. edition (April 17, 1997)\r\n\r\nSelections from great writings on economics, annotated and introduced by a distinguished economist and teacher.\r\n\r\nAuthor of The Worldly Philosophers, a 3-million-copy seller, Robert Heilbroner offers here a compendium of readings from the &quot;worldly philosophers&quot; themselves. The selections range from the earliest economic thought to such towering volumes as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population, David Ricardo's Principles of Political Economy, and John Maynard Keynes's The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. Acting as &quot;a docent, not merely an editor,&quot; he takes the reader through the core arguments with &quot;brilliantly clear commentary&quot; (New York Times Book Review).\r\n\r\nazw3 can be converted in Calibre to whichever format you prefer, or can be directly placed in a Kindle file directory. Having been told I was uploading &quot;useless&quot; azw3 files, I hope you take the time to read this, learn about Calibre, or shut the fuck up. Cheers. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nheliiaruy heliiaruy heliiaruy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29ffb7545ef77558f03cb9b78e46aca5ff1ade89","amp;dn":"Teachings+from+the+Worldly+Philosophers+%5E+Robert+L.+Heilbroner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29ffb7545ef77558f03cb9b78e46aca5ff1ade89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,255,183,84,94,247,117,88,240,60,185,183,142,70,172,165,255,26,222,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
