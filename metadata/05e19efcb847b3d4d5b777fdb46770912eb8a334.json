It is a port of Mupen64plus, along with Ari64ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s ARM dynarec (and gles2N64 as an option).\n\n* Run most games smoothly at a reasonable speed (if not full speed) with sound. This requires you have a high-end device (Nexus-S, Galaxy-S, Xoom, etc).\n* Good game compatibility compared to other N64 emulators running on mobile devices. And most likely more issues will be fixed in future updates.\n* Save/load game states at ANY points, as well as in-game save support. Save files are fully compatible with Mupen64plus on PC.\n* A configurable, translucent on-screen keypad that is very easy to use.\n* Key mappings to map game keys to hardware buttons.\n* Option to use the G-sensor as the analog stick.\n* A variety of settings that you can tune on your needs.\n\n*System requirement*\n- Android 2.0 or above\n- ARMv7 compatible CPU\n- OpenGL-ES 2.0\n\n*NOTE*: Save files generated by v1.1.4 are no longer supported.
