'Door, Door' is their first release. The album is radically different in style from the recordings under the Birthday Party name that would follow after 1980, featuring an emphasis on pop singability and structure. In contrast to the conventional production stands Nick Cave's thick, unpolished vocal style and expressive lyrics. Together, they form a body of very catchy pop songs with an edge.\n\nThe standout tracks are 'Brave Exhibitions', 'After A Fashion'(penned by Rowland S. Howard), and 'Dive Position', the last of which is the most similar in spirit to the recordings of The Birthday Party.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f74d9bfadd9ecefc3f3771b3d232ec41b006e4a","amp;dn":"The+Boys+Next+Door+-+Door%2C+Door+%281979%29%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f74d9bfadd9ecefc3f3771b3d232ec41b006e4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,116,217,191,173,217,236,239,195,243,119,27,61,35,46,196,27,0,110,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
