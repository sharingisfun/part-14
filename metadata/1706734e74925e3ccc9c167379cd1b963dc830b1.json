Due to a blood spell cast on a battlefield during the Revolution, the infamous headless horseman is revived along with Crane, and the murderous rider embarks on a bloody rampage in present-day Sleepy Hollow. Ichabod realizes that he must act quickly, for the headless horseman is only the first of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Detective Abbie Mills, a woman familiar with supernatural experiences, forms a bond with Crane as they try to stop an increasingly vicious cycle of evil.\n\nTom Mison..............as Ichabod Crane\nNicole Beharie.........as Detective Abbie Mills\nOrlando Jones.........as Captain Frank Irving\nKatia Winter............as Katrina Crane","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1706734e74925e3ccc9c167379cd1b963dc830b1","amp;dn":"Sleepy+Hollow%2CSWESUB.S01E01-S01E012+-Lindoff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1706734e74925e3ccc9c167379cd1b963dc830b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,6,115,78,116,146,94,60,204,156,22,115,121,205,27,150,61,200,48,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
