Based around three classic effects (multimode filter, pitchshifter and delay), its aim is to generate evolving variations of the input audio by crossfading between two instances of each effect and modulating their key parameters using an extensive array of control modules. 4 LFOs with optional tempo sync and 2 envelope followers can have their output inverted or combined using mixers and multipliers. From subtle dub delays to mad glitch sequences, rmpx4 will help you generate complex variations of your original ideas.\n\nAdditional features include the ability to resize the plugin interface to fit your display (Windows and OS X only), share your presets between plugin formats and platforms, map your MIDI controller easily using the built-in MIDI learn system, and trigger presets using MIDI program changes.\n\n\n\nRmpx4 is available for Windows, Mac Os X, and Linux as VST (32/64 bit) and AU (32/64 bit, Mac only).\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install the plugin.\n3.Register with serial provided or use our keygen on Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
