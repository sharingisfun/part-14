It combines the standard Mario Kart game and his custom version with loads of new tracks!! Great if the kids (or you!) want a few more tracks to blast around...\n\nGame Name: Wiimms MKW-Fun (Mario Kart World-Fun)\nRelease  : 2014-04\nGame ID  : RMCP25 (different from standard Mario Kart, so can use both!)\nSaves    : Different Licences from standard Mario Kart to prevent corruption\nFormat   : PAL\nLanguage : ENGLISH\n\nMore info: http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Wiimms_Mario_Kart_Fun_2014-04\n\nI take *NO* credit for this game, just downloaded and merged/created it for my kids. This was a bit fiddly to do, and thought some people may not be able to do this (or have all the tools to do it), so I figured I would upload this to help them out.\n\nIf you like it, maybe buy a new Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! :-)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05388180f18273f01d3d9991a8b6c3d2a1be848f","amp;dn":"Wiimms+MKW-Fun+2014-04.v2.pal%2B+%5BRMCP25%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05388180f18273f01d3d9991a8b6c3d2a1be848f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,56,129,128,241,130,115,240,29,61,153,145,168,182,195,210,161,190,132,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
