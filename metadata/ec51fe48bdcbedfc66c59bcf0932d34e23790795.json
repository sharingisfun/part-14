The album was produced by Cooder who travelled to Cuba to record sessions with the musicians, many of whom were previously largely unknown outside Cuba. The musicians and the songs were later also featured in a documentary film of the same name. The music featured on the album was inspired by the Buena Vista Social Club, a membership club that was at its height during the 1940s and 1950s. Many of the musicians performing on the record were either former performers at the club or were prominent Cuban musicians during the era of the club's existence. Other younger musicians on the record trace their musical roots back to pre-revolutionary Cuban music, mainly the famous Havana musical scene of the 1950s.\n\nBuena Vista Social Club earned considerable critical praise and has received numerous accolades from several music writers and publications. In 2003, the album was ranked number 260 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, one of only two albums on the list to be produced in a non-English speaking country.\n\n.: Cover :.\n\n[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img443/6333/buenavistasocialclub.jpg[/img]\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01 - CHAN CHAN - 4'24&quot;\n02 - DE CAMINO A LA VERADA - 5'10&quot;\n03 - EL CUARTO DE TULA - 7'41&quot;\n04 - PUEBLO NUEVO - 6'08&quot;\n05 - DOS GARDENIAS - 3'03&quot;\n06 - Y TU QUE HAS HECHO - 3'17&quot;\n07 - VEINTE ANOS - 3'32&quot;\n08 - EL CARRETERO - 3'33\n09 - CANDELA - 5'38&quot;\n10 - AMOR DE LOCA JUVENTUD - 3'26&quot;\n11 - ORGULLECIDA - 3'21&quot;\n12 - MURMULLO - 3'50&quot;\n13 - BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB - 4'52&quot;\n14 - LA BAYAMESA - 2'53&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec51fe48bdcbedfc66c59bcf0932d34e23790795","amp;dn":"Buena+Vista+Social+Club+-+OST+%5BMp3+128%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec51fe48bdcbedfc66c59bcf0932d34e23790795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,81,254,72,189,203,237,252,102,197,155,207,9,50,211,78,35,121,7,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
