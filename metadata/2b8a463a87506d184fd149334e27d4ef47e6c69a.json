Produced by Toei Company Ltd., it was broadcast on NET (now TV Asahi) from May 12, 1973 to March 30, 1974, with a total of 46 episodes.\n\nPLOT SUMMARY:\nThree years have passed since Kikaida defeated DARK. The sky fills with thick black smoke. From a dark cloud streaks a bolt of lightning. Up out of the ground comes a dark form--Gill Hakaida, into whose head Professor Gill's brain has been implanted. Explosions follow, each resulting in the appearance of Red Hakaida, Blue Hakaida, and Silver Hakaida. The image of young boy, Akira, appears in the clouds. This is Akira, the object of the Hakaidas' ongoing search. In a Buddhist temple, the eyes of a statue begin to flash. With a bang, the statue falls apart to reveal a red and blue robot, Kikaida 01, the older brother of Kikaida. Kikaida 01 rides out in his Double Machine, to protect Akira and other innocents from the clutches of the Hakaidas.\n\nDETAILS:\nGenre: Tokusatsu, Action, Science Fiction\nRuntime: 24 min\nEpisodes: 46 (complete series)\nCountry: Japan\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English (hardsub)\n\nFile Size..............: 195MB\nFormat.................: AVI\nCodec..................: XViD\nVideo Bitrate..........: 900 Kbps\nResolution.............: 640x480\nAudio..................: MP3\nAudio Bitrate..........: 192 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b8a463a87506d184fd149334e27d4ef47e6c69a","amp;dn":"Kikaider+01+%281973%29+DVDRip+%5BComplete+English+Sub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b8a463a87506d184fd149334e27d4ef47e6c69a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,138,70,58,135,80,109,24,79,209,73,51,78,39,212,239,71,230,198,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
