George and Kathleen LutzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story went on to inspire a best-selling novel and the subsequent films have continued to fascinate audiences today. This documentary reveals the horror behind growing up as part of a world famous haunting and while DanielÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s facts may be otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiction, the psychological scars he carries are indisputable. Documentary filmmaker, Eric Walter, has combined years of independent research into the Amityville case along with the perspectives of past investigative reporters and eyewitnesses, giving way to the most personal testimony of the subject to date.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727523/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727523/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Documentary\niMDB Rating: 5,5/10 from 116 users\nDirector: Eric Walter\nStarring: Daniel Lutz, Laura DiDio, Neme Alperstein","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:574d2f91645c3646d9f90f5d14e8916e8cc5bbbf","amp;dn":"My+Amityville+Horror+2012+720p+WEBRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"574d2f91645c3646d9f90f5d14e8916e8cc5bbbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,77,47,145,100,92,54,70,217,249,15,93,20,232,145,110,140,197,187,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
