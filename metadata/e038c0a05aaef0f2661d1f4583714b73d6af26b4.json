On the methods side are proven techniques for monitoring subcellular RNA localization en masse, for mapping chromosomes at the resolution of a single gene, and for surveying the steady-state genome-wide distribution of DNA binding proteins in vivo. For those workers dealing with massive data sets, the book discusses the methodological aspects of data analysis and informatics in the design of microarray experiments, the choice of test statistic, and the assessment of observational significance, data reduction, and clustering.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e038c0a05aaef0f2661d1f4583714b73d6af26b4","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Functional+Genomics+%28Methods+in+Molecular+Biology%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e038c0a05aaef0f2661d1f4583714b73d6af26b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,56,192,160,90,174,240,242,102,29,31,69,131,113,75,115,214,175,38,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
