(Live 1963)\nMp3 320 mbit/s\nIncluded: This Info No Covers\n\nRecorded live in Decca's Studio No. 3, in front of several hundred screaming girls, with the Tornados (yes, the &quot;Telstar&quot; guys) backing him up. This is an energetic set, but one that, viewed in the cold light of history, is not enduring. Fury may have been one of the best of the pre-Beatles rockers, but that doesn't make him great. About half of this &quot;concert&quot; date consists of rock &amp; roll oldies like &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; and &quot;Unchain My Heart,&quot; sung in a competent sub-Elvis mold (though the Tornados aren't about to make anyone forget Scotty Moore or James Burton). There's also a lengthy medley of many of his early-'60s pop hits, which are better heard in their studio versions. The Tornados' arrangements have a certain dated charm, with a rinky-dink organ and tinny reverb guitar. But this has little more than nostalgic value, and not even that for American listeners, who were never aware of Fury in the first place. ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide\n\nTracklist:\n01.

Rheumatic fever, which damaged his heart, contributed to his death.\n\nEarly years\nBorn at Smithdown Hospital (later Sefton General Hospital, now demolished]), Smithdown Road, Liverpool, Ronnie Wycherley first attended a gig in Birkenhead run by impresario Larry Parnes, in the hope of interesting established artiste Marty Wilde in some of the songs he had written. Instead, in an episode that has become pop music legend, Parnes pushed young Wycherley up on stage right away. He was such an immediate success that Parnes signed him, added him to the tour, and renamed him &quot;Billy Fury&quot;.\nHe released his first hit for Decca, &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot;, in 1959. By March 1960, he hit UK Number 9 with his own composition &quot;Colette&quot;, followed by &quot;That's Love&quot; and his first album The Sound of Fury (1960), which featured a young Joe Brown on lead guitar, with backup vocals by The Four Jays.\nAfter further hits and sacking his band The Blue FlamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which included keyboardist Georgie FameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½auditions were held for a new group and held by Parnes in Liverpool. Among those who failed were the pre-fame Beatles, who for the first time called themselves The Silver Beetles. They were offered the job for Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£20 a week on condition that they sacked bass guitar player Stuart Sutcliffe. John Lennon refused and the band left after Lennon had secured Fury's autograph. The Beatles were salvaged, however, by being sent on a tour of Scotland with Johnny Gentle and Duffy Power, who were a couple more of Parnes' acts.\n\nUK chart and film success\nFury concentrated less on Rock 'n' Roll and more on mainstream ballads, such as &quot;Halfway to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot; (both 1961, each of which reached number 2 in the British Singles Chart). This was Decca's decision to mould Fury into a teen idol after his last self-penned song, &quot;My Christmas Prayer&quot;, had failed to chart. 1962 and 1963 were Billy Fury's best years chartwise. However, he was not a typical teen idol; there was too much sexuality in his performances and his renditions were never lightweight in the mould of some singers like Craig Douglas or Jimmy Justice. Fury's fans and contemporaries in music knew he was a rocker and the real thing musically.\nIn 1962 Fury appeared in his first film Play It Cool, modelled on the Elvis movies. It featured Helen Shapiro, Danny Rivers, Shane Fenton (aka Alvin Stardust) and Bobby Vee who appeared with the Vernons Girls. The hit single from the film was &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot;. In the film Fury did not get the girl but stayed with his friends. There are notable performances by many well-known British actors and performers such as Richard Wattis, Lionel Blair and Dennis Price. The music highlight of the film is Fury's singing of the title track.\nBilly Fury was known for excellent albums. His We Want Billy (released 1963, with The Tornados) was one of the first live albums in British rock history and featured renditions of his major hits and covers of several classic R&amp;B songs such as &quot;Unchain My Heart&quot; by Ray Charles. &quot;Turn Your Lamp Down Low&quot; (recorded in 1965 with backing band The Gamblers) was one of the earliest examples of a British act recording a track in the reggae style (with the emphasis on the second and fourth beats of each bar).\nIn 1965 he appeared in the film I've Gotta Horse, which featured the band The Bachelors. It was not a success but it seemed more real, and there are many interesting references to the British seaside towns of the 1960s. Appearing in minor roles were Michael Medwin, and Jon Pertwee of Doctor Who fame. The album from the film is available in stereo.\nHaving had more UK hits, such as &quot;It's Only Make Believe&quot; and &quot;I Will&quot; (written by Dick Glasser, not to be confused with the Paul McCartney song), both in 1964, and &quot;In Thoughts of You&quot; in 1965, Fury began a lengthy absence from the charts in 1967, and underwent surgery for heart problems caused by rheumatic fever which led to his abandoning touring. Despite spending many weeks on the charts, Billy Fury never achieved a number one single, but he remained popular even after his hits stopped. Fury's song &quot;I Will&quot; became a US hit for Dean Martin in 1965 and for Ruby Winters in 1977. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Fury&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Fury&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Tornados:\nThe first British group to top the American charts, the Tornados are best remembered for their ethereal organ-dominated instumental &quot;Telstar&quot;.\nThe band were London-based session musicians who were assembled by the legendary, maverick producer Joe Meek in 1961 as a deliberate challenge to The Shadows. They also worked as a backing-band for solo singers John Leyton, Don Charles and Michael Cox.\nIn 1962, while working as Billy Fury's backing group, they made their first recording &quot;Love And Fury&quot;. That failed but the Meek-penned follow-up &quot;Telstar&quot; - inspired by watching the first live television pictures transmitted via the Telstar satellite - was an international hit. The record was the first by a British group to top the American charts and went on to sell five million copies worldwide.\nHeinz Burt left for a solo career in 1963 but The Tornados carried on despite dwindling sales figures until '66, when the group disbanded and the members all returned to session work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:842a125202eb1b8cdc26df6559185b61ead3ae70","amp;dn":"Billy+Fury+%26+The+Tornados+-+We+Want+Billy%21+%28Live+1963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"842a125202eb1b8cdc26df6559185b61ead3ae70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,42,18,82,2,235,27,140,220,38,223,101,89,24,91,97,234,211,174,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
