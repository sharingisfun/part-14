Pilla&amp;#039;s informative book The Naked Truth - Everything You&amp;#039;ve Always Wanted to Know About the IRS But Couldn&amp;#039;t Afford to Ask (1986) which contains 163 questions and indepth answers about the IRS and the law, and should serve as a handbook for dealing with the IRS in nearly every situation you will encounter. Although the IRS is auditing less than before, if you are one of the &quot;lucky and chosen&quot; ones, this book will be a help in understanding the threats and intimidation that the IRS likes to wield on taxpayers. Pilla is one of the best authors on the subject of the IRS - his books are easy to read, get to the point, and are a real aid to taxpayers. The Naked Truth will provide enough information to even the odds in the audit arena. 210 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14dc3dec05dab77be9c34894d87a36935181de09","amp;dn":"Pilla+-+The+Naked+Truth+-+Everything+You%5C%27ve+Always+Wanted+to+Kn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14dc3dec05dab77be9c34894d87a36935181de09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,220,61,236,5,218,183,123,233,195,72,148,216,122,54,147,81,129,222,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
