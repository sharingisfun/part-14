It is expressing ideas and views which lighted him on the course of his policy toward the War, Peace and the Revolution. It throws light, therefore, on that policy; it helps to an understanding of it, if one wishes to understand. But that isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t all. \n\nThe spirit that flames and casts shadows upon these pages is not only Trotzky&amp;#039;s. It is the spirit also of the Bolsheviki; of the red left of the left wing of the revolutionary movement of New Russia. It flashed from Petrograd to Vladivostok, in the first week of the revolt; it burned all along the Russian front before Trotzky appeared on the scene. It will smoulder long after he is gone. It is a hot Fact which has to be picked up and examined, this spirit Whether we like it or donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, it is there; in Russia; it is elsewhere; it is everywhere today. It is the spirit of war; class war, but war. It is in this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0aeb7b71fb0cd6848037b532e6d15f6e5a2c5b","amp;dn":"Leon+Trotsky+-+War+And+The+International","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0aeb7b71fb0cd6848037b532e6d15f6e5a2c5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,10,235,123,113,251,12,214,132,128,55,181,50,230,209,95,110,90,44,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
