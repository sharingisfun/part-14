Her fondest wish -- just once before she dies -- is to revisit Bountiful, the small Texas town of her youth which she still refers to as &quot;home.&quot; The trouble is her son, Ludie, is too concerned for her health to allow her to travel alone and her petty daughter-in-law, Jessie Mae, insists they don't have money to squander on bus tickets. This prompts &quot;escape&quot; attempts each month which coincide with the arrival of Mrs. Watts' Social Security check. With writing by Horton Foote - &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; - this is the touching story of Mrs. Watts successful escape and last trip home.\n\n\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.36 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 47mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 809 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 1 675 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.282\n      Stream size : 1.26 GiB (93%)\n      Writing library : DivX 5.2.1 (WaffleDay) (UTC 2004-09-08)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 121 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 93.4 MiB (7%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 152 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17.6 --abr 128\n\nUpped KG: newgrange\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f247c1a6ddaa5a5e4b2d8749e7b6068ea78a4a2c","amp;dn":"The+Trip+to+Bountiful+%5B1985%5D+Geraldine+Page","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f247c1a6ddaa5a5e4b2d8749e7b6068ea78a4a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,71,193,166,221,170,90,94,75,45,135,73,231,182,6,142,167,138,74,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
