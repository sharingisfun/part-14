But New York Times bestselling author Bart D. Ehrman dares to call it what it was: literary forgery, a practice that was as scandalous then as it is today. In Forged, EhrmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fresh and original research takes readers back to the ancient world, where forgeries were used as weapons by unknown authors to fend off attacks to their faith and establish their church. So, if many of the books in the Bible were not in fact written by JesusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inner circleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but by writers living decades later, with differing agendas in rival communitiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½what does that do to the authority of Scripture?\n\nEhrman investigates ancient sources to:\n\n\nReveal which New Testament books were outright forgeries.\n\n\nExplain how widely forgery was practiced by early Christian writersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and how strongly it was condemned in the ancient world as fraudulent and illicit. \n\n\nExpose the deception in the history of the Christian religion.\n\nEhrmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fascinating story of fraud and deceit is essential reading for anyone interested in the truth about the Bible and the dubious origins of ChristianityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sacred texts.\n\nHardcover: 320 pages \nPublisher: HarperOne (March 22, 2011) \nLanguage: English \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc762fb4da11a1f855521aa58ec1979fcf38faaf","amp;dn":"Forged%3A+Writing+in+the+Name+of+God--Why+the+Bible%5C%27s+Authors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc762fb4da11a1f855521aa58ec1979fcf38faaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,118,47,180,218,17,161,248,85,82,26,165,142,193,151,159,207,56,250,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
