(2006) @320K\nUploader: valleyblue\nAdded On: 3 Aug 2007\nGenre: Rock\n\nJellyfish seemingly had all the right ingredients for success ? catchy, melodic pop songs squarely in the Beatles/Squeeze mold, plus strong kitsch appeal in its retro sound and wildly colorful, clashing wardrobe. Founding members Andy Sturmer (drums, vocals) and Roger Manning (keyboards) previously played in the pop/rock quartet Beatnik Beatch; after that group called it quits, the Jellyfish lineup was rounded out with guitarist Jason Falkner and bassist Chris Manning, brother of Roger. Bellybutton, the group&amp;#039;s well-received 1990 debut, produced a minor chart single in &quot;Baby&amp;#039;s Coming Back,&quot; but nothing made a major impact. The follow-up, Spilt Milk, followed the same style, adding more intricate arrangements and harmonies. Despite it being another stellar collection of tasty power pop, the album failed to live up to lofty expectations, and the band split up after an ensuing supporting tour wrapped up. \n\nIn the wake of their breakup, the former bandmembers turned up on different projects ? including former bassist Tim Smith&amp;#039;s outfit the Umajets, a pair of bands that include Roger Manning, Imperial Drag, and the Moog Cookbook, while Jason Falkner has issued a pair of critically acclaimed solo releases, very much in the style of his former band (Sturmer has appeared to have turned his back on performing and has produced such acts as the Merrymakers and Puffy). Although their career was short, a slew of Jellyfish-influenced bands began to crop up in their wake ? including the aforementioned Merrymakers, Ben Folds Five, the Hutchinsons, and the Excentrics, among others. A 14-track collection of Jellyfish&amp;#039;s best-known material (as well as a smattering of rare live tracks) (Greatest) was issued in 1999. \n\n\n\nTrack Listing: 1 Joining a Fan Club \n2 The King Is Half Undressed \n3 New Mistake \n4 Now She Knows She&amp;#039;s Wrong \n5 Bye, Bye, Bye \n6 Worthless Heart \n7 Baby&amp;#039;s Coming Back \n8 He&amp;#039;s My Best Friend \n9 All I Want Is Everything \n10 Let &amp;#039;Em In/That Is Why \n11 No Matter What \n12 Family Tree \n13 The Ghost at Number One \n14 Too Much, Too Little, Too Late \n15 I Wanna Stay Home \n16 Glutton of Sympathy \n17 The Man I Used to Be \n18 Calling Sarah \n19 Ignorance Is Bliss \n20 Think About Your Troubles \n\nLOVE THIS BAND TOO BITS!! fuck they just had a number one single covered by MC FLY ! what an accolade!! lol!\n\nenjoy and please SEED!!\n\n\n\nBit Rate: &lt;320kbps\n\nTracker: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSounds Like: beach boys/ rock/pop hybrid with multi harmonies\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97c67dd5d2b0213fc0c138cf36ae93f565bdaa6a","amp;dn":"jellyfish+-+best+%282006%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97c67dd5d2b0213fc0c138cf36ae93f565bdaa6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,198,125,213,210,176,33,63,192,193,56,207,54,174,147,245,101,189,170,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
