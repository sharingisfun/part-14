Cohen for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series follows the adventures of a late-20th-century New York City pizza delivery boy, Philip J. Fry, who, after being unwittingly cryogenically frozen for one thousand years, finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the retro-futuristic 31st century. The series was envisioned by Groening in the late 1990s while working on The Simpsons, later bringing Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.\n \n\nFuturama's seventh production season will consist of 26 episodes split equally across two broadcast seasons: 7A and 7B. It premiered on Comedy Central on June 20, 2012. A box set containing the 13 episodes of Season 7-A will be released as Futurama: Volume 7.
