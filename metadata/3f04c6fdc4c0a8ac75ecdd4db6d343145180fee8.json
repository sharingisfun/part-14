They consist of several of their early songs coupled with material that would appear on the Soundtrack From the Film More and Ummagumma, as well as unreleased songs. The concerts also featured visual performance elements such as the sawing and construction of a table and consumption of afternoon tea onstage.\n\nThis is the unedited soundboard recording of the September 13th, 1969 show at Concertgebouw, Amsterdam. This is NOT the frequently bootlegged version taken from the VPRO radio broadcast. The mix is slightly different from the radio broadcast, and the overall sound is outstanding. Total run time is 80:14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f04c6fdc4c0a8ac75ecdd4db6d343145180fee8","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+%7E+The+Man+%26amp%3B+The+Journey+COMPLETE+9%2F13%2F69","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f04c6fdc4c0a8ac75ecdd4db6d343145180fee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,4,198,253,196,192,168,172,117,236,221,77,182,211,67,20,81,128,254,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
