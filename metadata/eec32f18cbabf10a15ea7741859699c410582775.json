She has gorillas on her bedside lamp and even on her box of cereal. Hannah loves gorillas and longs to see a real one, but her father is always too busy - or too tired - to take her to the zoo. Then, on the night before her birthday, something extraordinary happens - and HannahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wish comes gloriously true.\n\n\n**********\n\n\nNotes: Have tested display of images within this ebook on the following devices and ereader applications:\nDesktop/laptop PC: Calibre and Kindle for PC\nIpad2: ibooks and Kindle for Apple\nSamsung Note 10.1 (2012 tablet): Aldiko, Moon+ Reader, and Kindle for Android.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eec32f18cbabf10a15ea7741859699c410582775","amp;dn":"Gorilla+ebook+by+Anthony+Browne+epub+mobi+fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eec32f18cbabf10a15ea7741859699c410582775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,195,47,24,203,171,241,10,21,234,119,65,133,150,153,196,16,88,39,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
