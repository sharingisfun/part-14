Korn bassist Fieldy felt as though his contributions to his band did not incorporate his love of rap enough. So during a down period between albums, he literally made a rap record despite having no previous experience in the genre besides listening to it. Programming most of the beats himself and enlisting producer Polar Bear to help with the rest, Fieldy's Dreams' first album was released in January of 2002. \n\n1. Cocky  \n2. Baby Hugh Hef  \n3.
