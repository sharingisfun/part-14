Throught this personal project I just put down my feelings, and Asphyxia is first made in order to evacuate sadness and hate, or other feeling I could have had since I started. Asphyxia music can be said as Electro-dark or Industrial, even if I try my best not to be a stereotype.\n\nBand Members Romain Florentz, programming &amp; voices\n \nInfluences + Electro-dark, Electro-noize, Gothic, Batcave, Classical +\nAgonoize, Amduscia, Arcana, Assemblage 23, Blutengel, Cephalgy, Cesium 137, Cinema Strange, Collide, Combichrist, Covenant, Dark Sanctuary, Dargaard, Das Ich, Die Form, Die Sektor, Dioxyde, Diva Destruction, Dulce Liquido, Elend, Feindflug, Flesh Field, Front 242, Front Line Assembly, Funker Vogt, God Module, Grendel, Haggard, Haujobb, Helium Vola, Hocico, Hypnoskull, Icon of Coil, KMFDM, L&amp;#039;Ame immortelle, Leather Strip, Micropoint, Ophidian, Panzer AG, Persephone, Psyclon Nine, Punish Yourself, Pzychobitch, SCR, Siouxie and the Banshees, Skinny Puppy, Suicide Commando, Switchblade Symphony, Syrian, Tactical Sekt, Tamtrum, Terminal Choice, The 69 Eyes, The CrÃƒÂ¼xshadows, The Horrorist, The Sisters of Mercy, Tristesse de la Lune, Tumor, Unter Null, Velvet Acid Christ, Virtual Embrace, VNV Nation, :Wumpscut:, X-Fusion \n\n+ Compilations +\nMesses SynthÃƒÂ©tiques [Track: Concupiscentia]\nNoise Terror Vol.2.
