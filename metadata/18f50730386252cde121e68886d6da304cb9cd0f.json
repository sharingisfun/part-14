He gets along with his colleagues although his boss wants him to go beyond technical cleanliness to problem solving. He's a dutiful husband; his wife's a social climber and pushes him to seek a promotion, but they also share sweet moments. He's a caring father, helping his son with homework. His parents visit; his mother criticizes his wife. Old School friends drop by, as do neighbors. Some comment on Raab's wife's expensive tastes. His promotion may be a long shot, especially after he gives a dull and tipsy toast at an office dinner. But why would Herr Raab run amok?  \n\n________________________________________\n\n\nDVDrip\n\ndur : 01h24\nenc : xvid 2-pass\nres : 544*400\n1070 kbs QF 0.197\nsnd : mp3 vbr mono 81k ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f50730386252cde121e68886d6da304cb9cd0f","amp;dn":"Why+Does+Herr+R.+Run+Amok%3F+%28R.+W.+Fassbinder+-+1970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f50730386252cde121e68886d6da304cb9cd0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,245,7,48,56,98,82,205,225,33,230,136,134,214,218,48,76,185,205,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
