That was no sheer coincidence, because actually not less than about 10 musicians, involved in the playground of Nucleus, joined the later Soft Machine. The only constant member (the nucleus, ha ha!) in the band's history was founder Ian Carr who played trumpet and flugelhorn.\n\n\nThese are the first three and most important albums of Nucleus, with a constant line-up lasting until &quot;Solarplexus&quot; in 1971.\n\nMuch to our regret Ian Carr, as a leading figure in the British jazz world died on February 25, 2009 at the age of 75.\n\n\nAlbums:\n- 1970 - Elastic Rock\n- 1970 - We'll Talk About It Later\n- 1971 - Solar Plexus\n\nLine-up:\n- Ian Carr / trumpet, flugelhorn\n- Karl jenkins / electric piano, oboe, piano, baritone saxophone\n- Brian Smith / tenor &amp; soprano saxes, flute\n- Chris Spedding / guitars\n- Jeff Clyne / bass, electric bass\n- John Marshall / drums, percussion\n\nGuest musicians on &quot;Solar Plexus&quot;:\n- Kenny Wheeler / trumpet, flugelhorn\n- Harry Beckett / trumpet, flugelhorn\n- Tony Roberts / Tenor saxophone, bass clarinet\n- Ron Matthewson / bass\n- Chris Karan / percussion\n- Keith Winter / synthesizer ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a228649bd4c7814c60329155fc238c5e1e7c533b","amp;dn":"Ian+Carr%5C%27s+Nucleus+-+First+Three+Albums+%281970+-+1971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a228649bd4c7814c60329155fc238c5e1e7c533b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,40,100,155,212,199,129,76,96,50,145,85,252,35,140,94,30,124,83,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
