Here's the video in all 700MB of glory, thanks to all the folks who mirror, and especially x_DontTreadOnMe_x. This man, or woman, is the loder of liberty. I used TMPGEnc DVD Author to chop it because Autogk couldn't encode it without the BS in the beginning. AutoGK is the best, and that's what I used to encode it into Xvid. Since AGI merely printed the svideo masters onto DVDs instead of VHS, there is no quality loss and Dunlap is an instructor, not Luther Vandross so don't complain about the sound.\n\nSIG Auto Pistols\n\nThe SIG pistol, in all of its models and iterations, is one of the highest quality and most respected handguns currently produced by experts in Law Enforcement and the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s militaries. It is in use by, and favored by many of the most elite tactical units in the world.\nBob Dunlap is a renowned expert on most of todays and yesterdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s important AND obscure firearms. He has been a warranty station for most manufacturers, both large and small. His understanding of the design, function, and repair of firearms in general is unsurpassed, and his appreciation of European and exotic arms is legendary among his students. This course is designed to help all of you SIG owners who love the gun, but are a little mystified about its workings. In typical AGI fashion, we use a factory cut-away gun that allows you to actually see how the various parts work and interact.\nhttp://www.americangunsmith.com/view.php?id=14\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f55f5be37653542ecaacf0f8eeba22b88a6952","amp;dn":"AGI+-+Sig+Pistols","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f55f5be37653542ecaacf0f8eeba22b88a6952","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,245,95,91,227,118,83,84,46,202,172,240,248,238,186,34,184,138,105,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
