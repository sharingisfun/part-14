The quality is something like V8 A8 since this was recorded via analog methods. \n\nThe reason for calling this &quot;PROPER&quot; is that the KILLERS releases and those encoded from them all have bad audio. Not to slam KILLERS, but they should at least check the first five seconds of their finished product before releasing it. \n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            Murdoch.Mysteries.S07E12.PROPER.WS.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            363,614,208 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             43:59.950\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         352\nFramerate:            23.976 fps\nBitrate:              966 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              128 kbps\nBitrate Type:         CBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7e9a418eca9833988a8bfa094906a31dd60cd2b","amp;dn":"Murdoch+Mysteries+S07E12+PROPER+WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7e9a418eca9833988a8bfa094906a31dd60cd2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,233,164,24,236,169,131,57,136,168,191,160,148,144,106,49,221,96,205,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
