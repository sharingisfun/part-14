This Fifth Edition has been thoroughly reorganized, revised, and updated: it includes extensive new coverage of topics ranging from wireless protocols to network performance, while reducing or eliminating coverage of older protocols and technologies. Comer begins by illuminating the applications and facilities offered by todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Internet. Next, he systematically introduces the underlying network technologies and protocols that make them possible: low-level data communications; packet switching, LAN, and WAN technologies; and Internet protocols such as TCP, IP, UDP, and IPv6. With these concepts and technologies established, he introduces several of the most important contemporary issues faced by network implementers and managers, including quality of service, Internet telephony, multimedia, network security, and network management. Comer has carefully designed this book to support both top-down and bottom-up teaching approaches. Students need no background in operating systems, and no sophisticated math: Comer relies throughout on figures, drawings, examples, and analogies, not mathematical proofs.\n\nHardcover: 768 pages\nPublisher: Prentice Hall; 5th edition (April 28, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0136066984\nISBN-13: 978-0136066989\nASIN: 0136061273\nAverage Customer Review: 4.1 out of 5 stars  \nAmazon Best Sellers Rank: #19,817 in Books \n#46 in Books &gt; Computers &amp; Technology &gt; Networking &gt; Networks, Protocols &amp; APIs\n#56 in Books &gt; Computers &amp; Technology &gt; Certification","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8cf49ef831482c500e6347c885b4a02cd760cec","amp;dn":"Computer+Networks+and+Internets+-+5th+Edition.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8cf49ef831482c500e6347c885b4a02cd760cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,207,73,239,131,20,130,197,0,230,52,124,136,91,74,2,205,118,12,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
