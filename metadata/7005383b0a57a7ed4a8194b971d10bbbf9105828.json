Volume III Part 3 explores the new prosperity and growth of the young city-states in the eighth to the sixth centuries B.C. This was the great period of expansion and colonization which saw the establishment of Greek city-states from the Western Mediterranean to the Black Sea. This volume describes the East and Egypt, the importance of West Greece and the Aegean islands in trading and exploration, the special characteristics of the societies which were established by colonization. While societies outside the mainstream of expansion and trade retained their old institutions, those at the centre changed rapidly and the period was a time of warfare in mainland Greece. Athens is seen developing into a leading state under the influence of the reforms of Solon and assessment of the social, economic and material history of Greece during these years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7005383b0a57a7ed4a8194b971d10bbbf9105828","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Ancient+History+Vol+03%2C+Part+03+-+The+Expansion+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7005383b0a57a7ed4a8194b971d10bbbf9105828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,5,56,59,10,87,167,237,74,129,148,185,113,209,11,187,249,16,88,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
