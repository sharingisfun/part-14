Nite Version contains some tracks that may sound familiar to clubbers. The Nite Version of &quot;E-Talking&quot; (one of the biggest club hits of 2004) and the kawasaki dub of &quot;NY Lipps&quot; stand among new tracks such as &quot;Another Excuse&quot; (A Collaboration with DFA) and their cover of Daft Punk?s &quot;Teachers&quot;. From Electro to Techo, from bombastic rock to disco, this record guarantees to keep you moving. The Album is mixed by de Dewaele Brothers (Soulwax/2 many DJ&amp;#039;s).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7954ec2b8b103babd0efcecc28707d864c9eb08c","amp;dn":"Soulwax-Nite+Versions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7954ec2b8b103babd0efcecc28707d864c9eb08c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,84,236,43,139,16,59,171,208,239,206,204,40,112,125,134,76,158,176,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
