The final 4 issues were released in 2008 by Image Comics.\n\nComic by Rob Schrab about a world in which one can buy robot assassins out of &quot;vending machines&quot;, the most popular of which are intelligent robots that kill a specified target and then self-destruct. The protagonist of the series is Scud, an average Heart Breaker Series 1373 model assassin. On his first mission, he is sent to kill Jeff, a rampaging female mutant with mousetraps for hands, an electrical plug for a head, and a squid for a belt. While on this mission, Scud glances in a mirror and sees the warning label on his back explaining how he will self-destruct upon completion of his mission. Realizing that he doesn't want to die, Scud mortally wounds Jeff, shooting off her arms and legs, then takes her to a hospital placing her on life support ensuring their mutual survival.\n\nScud: The Disposable Assassin's main plot follows Scud's career as a freelance mercenary and assassin, working to pay off Jeff's medical bills.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d4693e9d54ac0466e0c8565f561d357e8321d3","amp;dn":"Scud+-+The+Disposable+Assassin+v1+%28001+-+020+%2B+021+-+024%29++%281996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d4693e9d54ac0466e0c8565f561d357e8321d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,212,105,62,157,84,172,4,102,224,200,86,95,86,29,53,126,131,33,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
