Perhaps the human fascination with the supernatural stems from the fact that most of us, at some point in our lives, have experienced something we couldn't quite explain. From a very young age James Van Praagh was aware of a dimension that most of us cannot see, and he has dedicated his life to explaining it to the rest of us. Ghosts Among Us takes us on an incredible journey into the spirit world that brings to light one of our greatest mysteriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½what happens to us after we die?\n\nVan Praagh, the New York Times bestselling author and co-executive producer of the CBS series The Ghost Whisperer, shares his knowledge and life experience about ghosts, a subject that can seem to many of us both bizarre and terrifying. But when the world beyond is explained fully by an experienced guide, dismissal and apprehension can be turned into knowledge and inspiration. With incredible true ghost stories and surprising details about how ghosts actively participate in our lives, Van Praagh challenges us to question our perceptions and shows us how we can live more fully through understanding the world of spirits. Including eerily accurate readings, the author's development as a medium, and detailed how-to information, Ghosts Among Us is an all-encompassing guide to the supernatural.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9bc0bcc57c4d5488ce8037f69b952258cd332e5","amp;dn":"Ghosts+Among+Us+-+Uncovering+the+Truth+About+the+Other+Side","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9bc0bcc57c4d5488ce8037f69b952258cd332e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,188,11,204,87,196,213,72,140,232,3,127,105,185,82,37,140,211,50,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
