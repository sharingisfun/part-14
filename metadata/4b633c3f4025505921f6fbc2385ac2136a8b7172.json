It is the band's best-selling album, reaching No. 13 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and remaining on that chart for 33 weeks. Three singles also charted on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart: &quot;Dream Warriors&quot; reached No. 22, &quot;Prisoner&quot; at No. 37, and &quot;Burning Like a Flame&quot; at No. 20 as well as No. 72 on the Billboard Hot 100. Back for the Attack was certified Gold and Platinum on January 14, 1988.\n\n&quot;Dream Warriors&quot; was originally released earlier in 1987 as the theme song for the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. The album title for Back for the Attack was taken from an earlier Dokken track of the same name recorded during the sessions for Under Lock and Key (1985); it was later released as the B-side to &quot;Dream Warriors&quot;. The 2009 remaster includes &quot;Back for the Attack&quot; as a bonus track.\n\nTrack listing\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n\n1. \t&quot;Kiss of Death&quot;   \tGeorge Lynch, Don Dokken, Jeff Pilson \t5:51\n2. \t&quot;Prisoner&quot;   \tLynch, Pilson, Mick Brown \t4:20\n3. \t&quot;Night by Night&quot;   \tPilson, Lynch, Brown, D.
