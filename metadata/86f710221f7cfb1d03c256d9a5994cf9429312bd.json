The Victorian farmers - Ruth Goodman, Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn - return to the Acton Scott estate in Shropshire to celebrate a traditional Victorian Christmas.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nThe Victorian farmers - Ruth Goodman, Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn - return to the Acton Scott estate in Shropshire to celebrate a traditional Victorian Christmas. There's an enormous amount of farm work to be done on the estate in the lead-up to the festive season, including the hay harvest, to make food for the animals over winter. Having been thwarted last time by rain, the team anxiously monitor the weather. Peter travels to the Royal Agricultural Society's annual show with sheep expert Richard Spencer to choose a new ram for the flock; back at the farm, Ruth makes mincemeat for the Christmas mince pies. She also prepares for the hoped-for hay harvest celebration with some essentials - bread and butter.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nThe Victorian farm team tackle their biggest project yet: restoring the village blacksmith's forge. First they must make bricks to restore the chimney - a full five day and night process in which the farmer gets no sleep. As winter marches on and Christmas nears, they must source a Yule log: firewood to burn for the Twelve Days of Christmas. At the cottage, Ruth winter-proofs the house, making a paper blanket and remedies for chilblains, rheumatism, coughs and colds It is also a chance to begin preparations for the Christmas banquet in earnest - in particular, a very Victorian invention, Christmas crackers. Ruth enlists the help of Christmas cracker historian Peter Kimpton..\n\n3)  Part 3 \nChristmas is coming to Acton Scott, but first there's a huge amount of preparation to do. Ruth Goodman and food historian Ivan Day try their hand at making a Christmas pudding using the same methods as Bob Cratchit's wife in A Christmas Carol. Meanwhile, Alex and Peter light the forge for the first time to re-shoe the farm workhorse Clumper - the first time a horse has been shod at this forge in over five decades. Alex goes in search of a Christmas tree for the banquet, while Ruth and Peter head for the Victorian town of Blists Hill for Christmas shopping. At the cottage, Ruth meets Debbie Bamford to dye an array of colourful Christmas ribbons to decorate the tree and the presents that sit beneath it. Finally it's time for the Christmas meal in the estate's School Hall. With a rapturous toast to Queen Victoria and a quick trip to the cattle shed to wassail the animals, day turns into night and the drunken Victorian parlour games commence. The next morning it'll be time for the team to bid a fond farewell to Mr Acton as they depart Acton Scott for good.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/4760/victorianfarmchristmassm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/4760/victorianfarmchristmassm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/2015/victorianfarmchristmass.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1519 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 700 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/victorianchristmas/about.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/victorianchristmas/about.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86f710221f7cfb1d03c256d9a5994cf9429312bd","amp;dn":"BBC+Victorian+Farm+Christmas+1of3+DVDrip+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86f710221f7cfb1d03c256d9a5994cf9429312bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,247,16,34,31,124,251,29,3,194,86,217,165,153,76,249,66,147,18,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
