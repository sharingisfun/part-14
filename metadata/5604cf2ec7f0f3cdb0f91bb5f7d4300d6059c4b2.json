A rough mix had been done prior to this which turned out to be not so rough/really good, the band thought.  They planned on leaking it, but friends of theirs did it anyway early in August and the leaked version has been referred to as Engine Glow.  I think it was mixed by someone named 'Engine' or at 'Engine Studios' or some other relevant reason.\n\nThis is Engine Glow.  The track listing is the same as Canopy, and the songs are similar...a few songs have noticeable differences upon a few listens.\n\nIf you like this band, buy their albums and see them live.  Support them, they are awesome!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5604cf2ec7f0f3cdb0f91bb5f7d4300d6059c4b2","amp;dn":"Anathallo+-+Canopy+%28Engine%29+Glow+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5604cf2ec7f0f3cdb0f91bb5f7d4300d6059c4b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,4,207,46,199,240,243,205,176,249,27,181,247,212,48,13,96,89,196,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
