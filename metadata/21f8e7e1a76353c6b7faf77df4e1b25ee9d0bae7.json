A formidable boogie and blues pianist with a lovable growl of a voice, his most enduring achievements have fused New Orleans R&amp;B, rock, and Mardi Gras craziness to come up with his own brand of &quot;voodoo&quot; music. He's also quite accomplished and enjoyable when sticking to purely traditional forms of blues and R&amp;B. On record, he veers between the two approaches, making for an inconsistent and frequently frustrating legacy that often makes the listener feel as if &quot;the Night Tripper&quot; (as he's nicknamed himself) has been underachieving. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.94% CDDA &amp; 99.82% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog#\t\tR2 71450\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Bad Neighborhood (Ronnie &amp; Delinquents)\n02.Morgus The Magnificent (Morgus &amp; The 3 Ghouls)\n03.Storm Warning (Mac Rebennack)\n04.Sahara (Mac Rebennack &amp; His Orchestra)\n05.Down The Road (Roland Stone)\n06.Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya\n07.Mama Roux\n08.Jump Sturdy\n09.I Walk On Guilded Splinters\n10.Black Widow Spider\n11.Loop Garoo\n12.Wash, Mama, Wash\n13.Mardi Gras Day\n14.Familiar Reality - Opening\n15.Zu Zu Mamou\n16.Mess Around\n17.Somebody Changed The Lock\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Iko Iko\n02.Junko Partner\n03.Tipitina\n04.Huey Smith Medley\n05.Right Place Wrong Time\n06.Traveling Mood\n07.Life\n08.Such A Night\n09.I Been Hoodood\n10.Cold Cold Cold\n11.Quitters Never Win\n12.What Comes Around (Goes Around)\n13.Mos' Scocious\n14.Let's Make A Better World\n15.Back By The River\n16.I Wanna Rock\n17.Memories Of Prof. Longhair\n18.Honey Dripper\n19.Pretty Libby\n20.Makin' Whoopee!\n21.Accentuate The Positive\n22.More Than You Know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f8e7e1a76353c6b7faf77df4e1b25ee9d0bae7","amp;dn":"Dr.+John+-+Mos%27+Scocious+Anthology+2CD+1993+Flac+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f8e7e1a76353c6b7faf77df4e1b25ee9d0bae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,248,231,225,167,99,83,198,183,250,247,125,244,225,178,94,233,208,186,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
