Angela Dodson who needs his help to prove that her twin sister Isabel's death was not a suicide. The dead woman was a devout Catholic and Angela refuses to accept that she would have taken her own life. She's asked Constantine for help because he has a reputation for dealing with the mystical. In fact, he is a demon hunter whose sole purpose on Earth is to send demons back to the nether regions. John himself has been to Hell - as a young man he too committed suicide and now knows that he is destined to return there on his death - but hopes that his good deeds may somehow find him a place in Heaven. As he looks into Isabel's death, he realizes that demons are trying to break through to the human world and his battles lead him into a direct conflict with Satan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:802ed8082bd0b2b5d9b2724bffe394dad05ff70d","amp;dn":"Constantine%282005%29BDRip+XviD+AC3+BG+.and.+ENG+AUDIO+PYP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"802ed8082bd0b2b5d9b2724bffe394dad05ff70d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,46,216,8,43,208,178,181,217,178,114,75,255,227,148,218,208,95,247,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
