In this Nova documentary, Private Lives of Dolphins, we see footage of behavior never witnessed before. While the privacy of dolphins at research stations in Florida and Australia may not be as secluded as in the open seas, we do get a glimpse of their behavior in the wild. In addition, the dolphin's relationship with humans is closely examined. This fascinating study of the dolphin's intelligence, and their interactions with both their own kind and with us, furnishes the viewer with a unique insight into the development of the mammalian brain.&quot;\nNarrated by Stacy Keach.\n\nFile: PBS.Nova.-.S20E08.-.Private.Lives.of.Dolphins.mp4 (493MB)\nResolution: 702x480 (native DVD), 4:3 aspect ratio\nAudio: AAC 48kHz 128kb/s stereo\nVideo: H-264 MPEG-4, 29.97fps\nSubtitles: English\nEncoding: Handbrake, RF=25 (22.5 was too large but this looks fine regardless)\nOriginally broadcast: 1992-Nov-17\n\nNote: Wikipedia calls this episode S19E17 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)\n\nThis episode has already been posted ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5336135/Private_Lives_of_Dolphins_1992-2006_documentary_ENG_DVD5 ) but is 2.66GB (uncompressed DVD video) so here is a quality alternative at about one-fifth the size.\n\nPlease seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others!
