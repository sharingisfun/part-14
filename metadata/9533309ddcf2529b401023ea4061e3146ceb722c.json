It is a great shame that John Alderton had had enough because after he left the magic was gone, the antics of Mr. Cromwell, Doris Ewell, Mr. Price, Mr. Smith and Norman Potter were not enough to keep the series going.  \n\nA new batch of children were introduced, but from a character point of view they were a very poor substitute for the likes of Duffy, Sharon, Craven, Dennis, Maureen, and Frankie Abbott. Some new teachers were also brought in, but it did nothing to help keep the series alive and it was ultimately cancelled.\n\nDuffy and the gang make appearances throughout this series, as do Mrs Abbott and others from series 1 to 3, so it does have its moments.\n\nIf there is enough interest from people I can upload The Fenn Street Gang, see what you think...enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9533309ddcf2529b401023ea4061e3146ceb722c","amp;dn":"Please+Sir+-+Series+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9533309ddcf2529b401023ea4061e3146ceb722c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,51,48,157,220,242,82,155,64,16,35,234,64,97,227,20,108,235,114,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
