Recorded at Indian Camp Ranch Studios, Cortez, Colorado. Although Diane Arkenstone&amp;#039;s music is often compared with that of her former husband David Arkenstone, with whom she occasionally still records, her own oeuvre is generally much more meditative and introspective. As its name suggests, THE HEALING SPIRIT is a collection of restful, soothing compositions, the most notable of these being &quot;Secret Garden&quot; and &quot;Healing Spirit.&quot; But soothing doesn&amp;#039;t mean soporific. Both &quot;Transformation&quot; and the refreshing &quot;Dreamscape&quot; employ rejuvenating percussion and keyboards amidst the trademark swirl of Arkenstone&amp;#039;s angelic voicings.\n\n\nTracklist:\n        \n1. The Secret Garden  \n2. The Angels Voice  \n3. A Gentle Touch  \n4. Dreamscape   \n5. Transformation  \n6. Hidden World    \n7. Ocean Of Stars    \n8. Sanctuary    \n9. Waters Of Life     \n10. The Healing Spirit \n\nEnjoy It!!\nUlysses56\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6dfebfc5541d5837b9da5621a857d44acf4b843","amp;dn":"%28NEW+AGE%29+Diane+Arkenstone+-+The+Healing+Spirit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6dfebfc5541d5837b9da5621a857d44acf4b843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,223,235,252,85,65,213,131,123,157,165,98,26,133,125,68,172,244,184,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
