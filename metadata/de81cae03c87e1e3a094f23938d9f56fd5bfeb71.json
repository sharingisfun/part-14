But unexpected drought forces the family south in search of food, and there they suffer the spiritual impoverishment of life in the city. Wang LungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s courageous journey back to his farm is a spiritual affirmation of the values of the land.\n\nAwards:\n - Pulitzer Prize Winner\n - Nobel Prize-winning author\n - OprahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Book Club Selection\n\n\n\n[when baying comes back up: http://bayimg.com/kAeILAaCI]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de81cae03c87e1e3a094f23938d9f56fd5bfeb71","amp;dn":"THE+GOOD+EARTH+-+Pearl+S.+Buck.+Read+George+Guidall++%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de81cae03c87e1e3a094f23938d9f56fd5bfeb71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,129,202,224,60,135,225,227,160,148,242,57,56,217,245,111,213,191,235,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
