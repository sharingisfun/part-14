He has drawn on copious original sources and consulted experts familiar with them, enabling him to cast fresh light on familiar episodes\n The book's portrait of Churchill is scrupulously fair and often deeply moving Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ in fact Hastings excels with all his character portraits, especially with Roosevelt and Stalin. Hastings is truly a master of strategy and high command.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edc5a706ae4515b82fadb7fc7c438e24e7f7f885","amp;dn":"Finest+Years+-+Churchill+as+Warlord+1940-45","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edc5a706ae4515b82fadb7fc7c438e24e7f7f885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,197,167,6,174,69,21,184,47,173,183,252,124,67,142,36,231,247,248,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
