When a Native Australian man is accused of murdering a white woman, three white men (The Fanatic, The Follower and The Veteran) are given the mission of capturing him with the help of an experienced Native Australian (The Tracker). So they start their quest in the outback, not knowing that their inner wrestles against and for racism will be more dangerous than the actual hunting for the accused. Director:Rolf de Heer  Stars:David Gulpilil, Gary Sweet, Damon Gameau \n\nEnglish subtitle file included in torrent courtesy of FatPlank [RLB] for KG.
