The album marked a departure from the folk rock sound of the band's self-titled debut album towards a unique progressive rock sound, and also marked the growth of the band, as members Serge Fiori, Michel Normandeau and Louis Valois were joined by Pierre Daigneault and Serge Locat.\n\nSi on avait besoin d'une cinquiÃƒÂ¨me saison is regarded as &quot;one of the best transitional albums ever recorded and an essential item in QuÃƒÂ©bec's music history&quot;. It was nominated for the Juno Award for Best Selling Album in 1976 and was ranked at 56 in music journalist Bob Mersereau's The Top 100 Canadian Albums.\n\n\nThe album revolves around a seasonal concept; the first four songs each represent one of the traditional four seasons, respectively spring, summer, autumn, and winter, while the final track, &quot;Histoires sans paroles&quot;, represents the imaginary fifth season. Some lyrics on this album, like on Depuis l'automne, show the separatist ideology shared by the band at that time.\n\nThe band was supported by Marie Bernard playing the ondes Martenot, as well as the voice of Judi Richards in &quot;Histoires sans paroles&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78dc2e7f255eb6c12e5a96dcaa44afdfc66aff37","amp;dn":"Harmonium+-+%281975%29+Si+on+avait+besoin+d%27une+cinqui%26egrave%3Bme+sai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78dc2e7f255eb6c12e5a96dcaa44afdfc66aff37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,220,46,127,37,94,182,193,46,90,150,220,170,68,175,223,198,106,255,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
