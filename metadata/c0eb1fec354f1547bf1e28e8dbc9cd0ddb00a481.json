After a fierce daily \nbidding war at auction, the duo acquires a \nhome, sight unseen, meaning when they \nfirst enter their newly purchased house, they never \nknow what will be waiting behind the door. Will \nit be a biohazard, a meth lab, or an angry former \ntenant who just doesn't want to leave? Doug \nand Mike then have to clean up the place,\n renovate it, stage it, get it to market, and flip\n it...fast. It's a race against time, because every\n day means thousands of dollars out of their\n pocket. They're the ultimate prospectors, and\n the stakes couldn't be higher.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0eb1fec354f1547bf1e28e8dbc9cd0ddb00a481","amp;dn":"Flip.Men.Season.2.HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0eb1fec354f1547bf1e28e8dbc9cd0ddb00a481","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,235,31,236,53,79,21,71,191,30,40,232,219,201,205,13,219,0,164,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
