Rice, Duong D. Do (Wiley, 1995).pdf\n\nISBN 0471303771\n\nBridges the gap between classical analysis and modern applications. Following the chapter on the model building stage, it introduces traditional techniques for solving ordinary differential equations, adding new material on approximate solution methods such as perturbation techniques and elementary numerical solutions. Also includes analytical methods to deal with important classes of finite-difference equations. The last half discusses numerical solution techniques and partial differential equations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0184d17a2f42116be8ac68e97722a172d2b51cfe","amp;dn":"Applied+Mathematics+and+Modeling+for+Chemical+Engineers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0184d17a2f42116be8ac68e97722a172d2b51cfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,132,209,122,47,66,17,107,232,172,104,233,119,34,161,114,210,181,28,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
