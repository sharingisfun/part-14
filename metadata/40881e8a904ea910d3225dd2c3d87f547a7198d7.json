When this September 23rd show was broadcast, AT40 only had one more three-hour show to release and then they went to a four-hour format. All my old AT40 shows survived on an external hard drive. Some of those are shows from 1978 and 1979 where the re-broadcasting stations only played the last three hours of a four hour show. Each one is like a smile with a missing tooth. As soon as I get a new desk top, I'll get back to torrenting them, however they were recorded. Now, on with the countdown!\n\n\n&quot;Hello again, and welcome to American Top 40. I'm Casey Kasem and this is our weekly countdown of the forty hottest records in the country.&quot;\n\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nA listener writes, &quot;When Chuck Mangione was on the chart recently with an instrumental hit, it made me wonder which recording act in the rock era placed the most instrumentals in the top 40.&quot; The act that did it put more than two dozen hits in the hot 100 and 15 in the top 40.\n\nThere is a group in the countdown who once had a job in a night-club where the owner wouldn't let them play the most popular song they'd ever had. That song is in this countdown.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What has been the biggest song of the rock era with a man's name in the title?&quot;\n\nCasey tells us about a session musician who has 150 gold records to his name, more than Elvis or The Beatles.\n\n40:    Heartbreaker - Dolly Parton\n39:    Paradise By Dashboard Lights - Meat Loaf\n38:    Devoted To You - Carly Simon &amp; James Taylor        \n37:    Almost Like Being In Love - Michael Johnson    \n36:    Josie - Steely Dan     \n35:    Beast Of Burden - The Rolling Stones    \n34:    Magnet And Steel - Walter Egan\n33:    Miss You - The Rolling Stones\n32:    5-7-0-5 - City Boy\n31:    Talking In Your Sleep - Crystal Gayle\n30:    I Love The Night Life - Alicia Bridges\n29:    Who Are You - The Who    \n28:    You Never Done It Like That - The Captain &amp; Tennille\n27:    Just What I Needed - The Cars\n26:    She's Always A Woman - Billy Joel\n25:    Come Together - Aerosmith\n24:    Back In The U.S.A. - Linda Ronstadt\n23:    Grease - Frankie Valli\n22:    Love Theme From Eyes Of Laura Mars - Barbra Streisand\n21:    Get Off - Foxy\n20:    Right Down The Line - Gerry Rafferty\n19:    Shame - Evelyn ChampagneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ King\n18:    Oh Darlin' - Robin Gibb\n17:    Got To Get You Into My Life - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n16:    Whenever I Call You &quot;FriendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Kenny Loggins\n15:    Hollywood Nights - Bob Seger\n14:    You Needed Me - Anne Murray\n13:    You And I - Rick James\n12:    Fool If You Think It's Over - Chris Rea\n11:    Love Is In The Air - John Paul Young\n10:    Reminiscing - The Little River Band\n9:    Hot Child In The City - Nick Gilder\n8:    Hot Blooded - Foreigner\n7:    Don't Look Back - Boston\n6/LDD: Summer Nights - John Travolta &amp; Olivia Newton-John\n5:    An Everlasting Love - Andy Gibb\n4:    Three Times A Lady - The Commodores\n3:    Hopelessly Devoted To You - Olivia Newton-John\n2:    Kiss You All Over - Exile\n1:    Boogie Oogie Oogie - A Taste Of Honey\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40881e8a904ea910d3225dd2c3d87f547a7198d7","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_September_23rd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40881e8a904ea910d3225dd2c3d87f547a7198d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,136,30,138,144,78,169,16,211,34,93,210,195,216,127,84,122,113,152,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
