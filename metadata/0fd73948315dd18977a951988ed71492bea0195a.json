The arranged marriage of Philip (Matthew Rhys) and Elizabeth Jennings\n(Keri Russell), who have two children Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 13-year-old Paige (Holly Taylor) and\n10-year-old Henry (Keidrich Sellati), who know nothing about their parents' true\nidentity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ grows more passionate and genuine by the day, but is constantly tested\nby the escalation of the Cold War and the intimate, dangerous and darkly funny\nrelationships they must maintain with a network of spies and informants under\ntheir control. Complicating their relationship further is Philip's growing sense\nof affinity for America's values and way of life. Tensions also heighten upon\nthe arrival of a new neighbor, Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich), an FBI agent. Stan\nand his partner, Agent Chris Amador (Maximiliano HernÃƒÂ¡ndez), are members of a new\ndivision of Counterintelligence tasked with fighting against foreign agents on U.S.\nsoil, including KGB Directorate S illegals, Russian spies posing as Americans.\n\nProduced by FX Productions, DreamWorks, Amblin and Fox Television Studios.\n\n\nJust when Philip and Elizabeth think they have a quiet road ahead, an old friend\nreturns to complicate things. Not only do they have to intercept a target who\ncould prove valuable to the Soviet Union, but they also have to take on an\nimportant rogue mission without the support of the Centre. Divisions inside\nthe Rezidentura deepen between Oleg and Arkady and there's an upheaval at\nthe FBI as the chickens come home to roost for Agent Gaad. Meanwhile,\nMartha's frustrations threaten to blow Philip's cover.\n\nThe.Americans.S02E04.A.Little.Night.Music.WEB-DL.x264.AAC.mp4\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x404 23.976fps [CRF 19.0]\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo  [128Kbps ABR]\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:46:49\nFile size: 246 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd73948315dd18977a951988ed71492bea0195a","amp;dn":"The.Americans.S02E04.A.Little.Night.Music.WEB-DL.x264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd73948315dd18977a951988ed71492bea0195a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,215,57,72,49,93,209,137,119,169,81,152,142,215,20,146,190,160,25,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
