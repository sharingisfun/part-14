Every document or file you download, every web page or link you click on, is scanned by AVG before you open it. Unlike other security products, we stop the threats before they reach your hard drive and become a problem. Safe internet surfing is now possible.\n\nTraditional antivirus isn't enough!\n\n&quot;Traditional&quot; viruses and spyware keep on growing - every day we see tens of thousands of new examples in our labs. And online criminals are getting smarterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they keep inventing types of threat that have never been seen before, usually aimed at stealing your bank account, credit card details or other personal information, so weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve developed an extra layer of identity theft protection that sits on top of traditional antivirus and antispyware software. It looks for changes in your PC's behavior that are caused by new threats ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and then stops them in their tracks.\nThreats can be here today, gone tomorrow!\n\nCybercriminals are also setting up their own web sites ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or poisoning legitimate websites ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to distribute all sorts of malware over the internet. These web ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œexploitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are often around for less than a day, shutting up shop once theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve infected enough people for that day. So to counter this, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve developed real-time software protection that gives you safety ratings for web pages and stops you opening the bad ones at the only time that matters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re about to click the link.\n\n\n\nHOW TO INSTALL:\n\n1. Run the Exe &quot;avg_avwt_stf_all_8_199a1389&quot;\n\n2. When the setup starts it will tell you that it's recommended to Uninstall the anti-virus you have (if u have one). You can do it or just install it without uninstalling the other one. (I Would Recommend to Uninstall the Old one So AVG can Download the Definitions Safely)\n\n3. On the Setup is A place to Paste a Serial, It already Has one There but You have To delete It and Paste the One given On the Torrent:\n\n8MEH-REDSL-7ETEC-ULA8R-EAOKL-4EMBR-ACED\n\nThat one Expires until 2018.\n\n4. After the Installation finishes Open AVG and It Will probably Say that Your Data Base is Obsolete so just Download all The updates.\n\n5. Restart your Computer and Just to Be sure Run the Anti Virus.\n\nEnjoy your Safety\n\nLeave a Comment if You need Help.\n\nThanks to Blaze69 for This Grate torrent\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8576fbd86c3877a86ea40814e6a228da0aa8e8a","amp;dn":"AVG+Antivirus+8+0+%2B+Serial+Expires+Year+2018-Clean+%2F-ZM-%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8576fbd86c3877a86ea40814e6a228da0aa8e8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,87,111,189,134,195,135,122,134,234,64,129,78,106,34,141,160,170,142,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
