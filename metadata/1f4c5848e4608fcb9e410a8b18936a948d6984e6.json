So when you throw in imaginary friends turned real, monster attacks, and faerie magic - well, that's just not fair, is it? Suburban Glamour follows Astrid Johnson as she and her best friend Dave get caught in a faerie family battle that stretches back through the centuries. Modern teenage life meets age-old magic in this story from the co-creator of Phonogram!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f4c5848e4608fcb9e410a8b18936a948d6984e6","amp;dn":"Suburban+Glamour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f4c5848e4608fcb9e410a8b18936a948d6984e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,76,88,72,228,96,143,203,158,65,10,139,24,147,106,148,141,105,132,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
