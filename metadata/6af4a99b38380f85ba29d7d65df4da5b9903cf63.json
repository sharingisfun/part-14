Since then some of the greatest road and racing cars ever made have been those bearing the famous Porsche shield. Join us as we celebrate these legendary cars and their legacy. We look at the most outstanding road cars of the last fifty years, from the first VW-inspired models through the illustrious 911 in its various incarnations to the current Boxster convertible. The super-cool Carrera GT concept car points to he future direction of Porsche's road-going cars. And then we concentrate on the great racing success Porsche has achieved at events like the Le Mans and Daytona 24-Hours and the Paris-Dakar, East African Safari and Monte Carlo ralies. Archive footage from these events together with interviews with Le Mans winners Richard Attwood and Hurley Haywood bring this racing heritage to life. The 356 coupes of the 1950s, highly successful 907/908 and awesome 917; the all conquering 956/962, the 914/6 and the 911 Carrera RSR; the whale-tailed 935, fabulous 959 supercar plus the 1998 Le Mans-winning 911 GTi - every significant competition car over four decades is featured in depth. Enduring, exotic and always exciting, Porsche has always been more than just a sportscar.
