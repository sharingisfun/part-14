Climbing a notch to 27 this week here is the group Utopia with, 'Set Me Free'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is one I found on the internet.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nA listener wants to know what album has spent the most weeks at number one on the album chart. Casey says that although the soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever and Rumors by Fleetwood Mac stayed at number one for 24 and 31 weeks respectively, this LP stayed in the number one spot for 16 months!\n\nOne artist in this countdown got her big break by dancing on the television show &quot;Soul Train&quot; but she had to be snuck in by another dancer in the trunk of his car. The sneaker and the sneakee are now members of a group who have a song in this countdown.\n\nCasey tells how Neal Schon (guitarist for Journey) was offered positions in Eric Clapton's band Cream and with the group Santana, both before the age of sixteen.\n\nOne artist in the countdown was once in a band so untalented that he had to write simple songs for them so they would have something to play.\n\nCasey tells how, when the group Dr. Hook was on tour in Japan, they got boredand tried wrestling some of Japan's top sumo wrestlers. The account is laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nAir Supply has their first chart hit in this countdown, &quot;Lost In Love&quot; at number 6.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What number one song in the rock era took the longest time to drop off the chart after leaving the number one spot?&quot; Casey says this song, by a man known for his white buck shoes, took 24 weeks to fall off the hot 100.\n\nThis is the week that Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; passes Carole King's &quot;Tapestry&quot; album for most weeks on the album chart. It would eventually fall off the Album chart after 741 weeks, or almost 14 years.\n\nLW#3: Working My Way Back To You - The Spinners\nLW#2: Call Me - Blondie\nLW#1: Another Brick In The Wall - Pink Floyd\n40:    Heart Hotels - Dan Fogelberg\n39:    Desire - Andy Gibb\n38:    Three Times In Love - Tommy James        \n37:    Funky Town - Lipps Inc.     \n36:    Only A Lonely Heart Sees - Felix Cavaliere     \n35:    Do Right - Paul Davis\nLDD: An Everlasting Love - The Bee Gees    \n34:    Carrie - Cliff Richard\n33:    Fire In The Morning - Melissa Manchester\n32:    I Can't Help It - Andy Gibb &amp; Olivia Newton-John\n31:    The Second Time Around - Shalamar\n30:    Breakdown Dead Ahead - Boz Scaggs\nEXTRA: Happy Together - The Turtles\n29:    Brass In Pocket - The Pretenders\n28:    Stomp - The Brothers Johnson\n27:    Set Me Free - Utopia\n26:    Any Way You Want It - Journey\n25:    Cars - Gary Numan\n24:    Biggest Part Of Me - Ambrosia\nARCHIVE: You Needed Me - Anny Murray\n23:    Hurt So Bad - Linda Ronstadt\n22:    Think About Me - Fleetwood Mac\n21:    Him - Rupert Holmes\n20:    I Pledge My Love - Peaches &amp; Herb\n19:    And The Beat Goes On - The Whispers\n18:    How Do I Make You - Linda Ronstadt\n17:    Pilot Of The Airways - Charlie Dore\nLDD: Love Thing From &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; - Henry Mancini\n16:    Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer - Kenny Rogers With Kim Carnes\n15:    Crazy Little Thing Called Love - Queen\n14:    Hold Onto My Love - Jimmy Ruffin\n13:    Sexy Eyes - Dr. Hook\nARCHIVE: Macarthur Park - Donna Summer\n12:    You May Be Right - Billy Joel\n11:    Too Hot - Kool &amp; The Gang\n10:    Off The Wall - Michael Jackson\n9:    Working My Way Back To You - The Spinners\n8:    I Can't Tell You Why - The Eagles\n7:    Fire Lake - Bob Seger\n6:    Lost In Love - Air Supply\n5:    Special Lady - Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown\n4:    With You I'm Born Again - Billy Preston &amp; Syreeta\n3:    Ride Like The Wind - Christopher Cross\n2:    Another Brick In The Wall - Pink Floyd\n1:    Call Me - Blondie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5641035027834a5c8b681197e308a8e26b874c2","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1980_April_19th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5641035027834a5c8b681197e308a8e26b874c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,100,16,53,2,120,52,165,200,182,129,25,126,48,138,142,38,184,116,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
