If the abusive attitude keeps up I have no problem pulling my torrents.\n\nWelcome to the 2014 version of DC Universe 52.  Each week I will bring you the currrent weeks' comics fresh from the depths of your local comic shop.  This week is week 131 (February 26th) and includes 15 issues.  Join me on this journey, won't you?\n\nNOTE:  Yes I am aware that Animal Man is listed among both this and last week's submissions.  I have chosen to include it since ComicList listed it both weeks.  If you do not want to download it, either move on to the next torrent or deselect it in your torrent application.\n\nBefore uploading these, I am opening them with ComicRack, and made sure they all opened there. If there are problems please let me know. As usual, these are not my scans. Thanks to the original scanners and uppers. If you like what you got here, please purchase them in some form.
