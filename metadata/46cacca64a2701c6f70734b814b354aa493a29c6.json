Spanning the period from the death of Alexander the Great, when Greek culture was introduced into Bactria, to  the end of classical, Mazdean, and Buddhist civilizations in Central Asia, when Islamic hordes wreaked destruction upon their culture in seventh century a.d., the  book is a vivid chronicle of the artistic heritage of the whole area.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46cacca64a2701c6f70734b814b354aa493a29c6","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Central+Asia+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46cacca64a2701c6f70734b814b354aa493a29c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,202,204,166,74,39,1,198,247,7,52,184,20,179,84,170,73,58,41,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
