Via Arista Records, it was released on September 30, 2003, in most of Japan, November 24, 2003 in the United Kingdom and with a late release on June 21, (see 2004 in music) in North America. The album comprises nearly all of their singles (with the sole exception being &quot;Hands Up,&quot; which was inexplicably not included) released between the years of 1991 and 2003, compiling all their albums Ooooooohhh.... On the TLC Tip (1992), CrazySexyCool (1994), FanMail (1999) and 3D (2002), as well as soundtracks to films such as Poetic Justice (1993). Most of the tracks on this album are radio edits in order to fit all of the songs on one disc. While featuring new material, the greatest hits disc contains rare tracks such as a 2003 production &quot;Come Get Some,&quot; which featured Sean Paul and Lil Jon of YoungBloodZ, and an exclusive censored version of the song &quot;Whoop De Woo&quot; (a leftover track from the 3D recording sessions (2002)) and a digital download of &quot;I Bet,&quot; the single which featured winner O'so Krispie from their UPN reality television R U the Girl. All &quot;singles&quot; on the album appear in their original radio released format. The album debuted to number 53 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart in its opening week with about 26,000 copies sold. However, the album did well in Latin America, peaking in Mexican International album charts at #3 and was certified Gold in late 2004 (50,000 sold). The album has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg\n[02] What About Your Friends\n[03] Hat 2 Da Back\n[04] Get It Up\n[05] Baby-Baby-Baby\n[06] Creep\n[07] Red Light Special\n[08] Waterfalls\n[09] Diggin' On You\n[10] Kick Your Game\n[11] Silly Ho\n[12] No Scrubs (Rap Version)\n[13] Unpretty\n[14] Come Get Some\n[15] Girl Talk\n[16] Damaged\n[17] Whoop De Woo\n[18] In Your Arms Tonight\n[19] Turntable\n\n\nMusic Videos \n\n[01] Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg\n\nGeneral           : [1992] TLC - Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg.mpg\nFormat            : MPEG-PS at 2 782 Kbps\nLength            : 86.9 MiB for 4mn 22s 120ms\nVideo #0          : MPEG Video at 2 503 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 224 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz\n\n[02] Waterfalls\n\nGeneral           : [1995] TLC - Waterfalls.mpg\nFormat            : MPEG-PS at 2 785 Kbps\nLength            : 118 MiB for 5mn 56s 440ms\nVideo #0          : MPEG Video at 2 505 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 224 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz\n\n[03] Creep\n\nGeneral           : [1994] TLC - Creep.mpg\nFormat            : MPEG-PS at 2 783 Kbps\nLength            : 86.3 MiB for 4mn 20s 80ms\nVideo #0          : MPEG Video at 2 503 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 224 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz\n\n[04] No Scrubs\n\nGeneral           : [1999] TLC - No Scrubs.mpg\nFormat            : MPEG-PS at 2 783 Kbps\nLength            : 86.0 MiB for 4mn 19s 360ms\nVideo #0          : MPEG Video at 2 504 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 224 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz\n\n[05] Unpretty\n\nGeneral           : [1999] TLC - Unpretty.mpg\nFormat            : MPEG-PS at 2 785 Kbps\nLength            : 123 MiB for 6mn 10s 240ms\nVideo #0          : MPEG Video at 2 506 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 224 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz\n\n\n[06] Behind The Scenes Interviews And Tribute\n\nGeneral           : Behind The Scenes Interviews And Tribute.mpg\nFormat            : MPEG-PS at 1 395 Kbps\nLength            : 63.5 MiB for 6mn 21s 880ms\nVideo #0          : MPEG Video at 1 150 Kbps\nAspect            : 352 x 288 (1.304) at 25.000 fps\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 224 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 01h:17m:49s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 756mb (Including MP3s, Videos, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Mpeg\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; R&amp;B Hip Hop Rap\nRelease Date\t&gt; 30 September 2003 [Japan] 24 November 2003 [UK] 21 June 2005 [US]\nRecord Company\t&gt; Arista BMG Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.poprockbands.com/tlc/band/prt.html\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLC_%28band%29\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/t/tlc.html\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f11fc319389866a6857bac427f2bf38a7afeeb04","amp;dn":"%5B2003%5D+Now+And+Forever+%28The+Hits%29+-+TLC+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f11fc319389866a6857bac427f2bf38a7afeeb04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,31,195,25,56,152,102,166,133,123,172,66,127,43,243,138,122,254,235,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
