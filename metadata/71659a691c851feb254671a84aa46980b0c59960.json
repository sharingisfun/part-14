She launched her YouTube page in 2009 and began covering songs by Adele, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez, accompanying herself on piano and earning a large digital audience in the process. One of her viewers was Selena GomezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, who eventually became her manager. With his help, Grimmie released an independent EP, 2011Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Find Me, and hit the road that summer with Selena Gomez, whose music shared a similar dance-pop sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71659a691c851feb254671a84aa46980b0c59960","amp;dn":"Must+Be+Love+-+Christina+Grimmie+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71659a691c851feb254671a84aa46980b0c59960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,101,154,105,28,133,31,235,37,70,113,168,74,164,105,128,176,197,153,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
