The balanced 13-track effort is the polished and passionate testament to seven years of hard work, heavy touring and diligent attention to its craft. From the swirling grinds of the first single &quot;So Happy&quot; to the soaring melodicism of &quot;Not Meant to Be&quot; and &quot;By The Way,&quot; &quot;Scars &amp; Souvenirs&quot; is a broad-reaching endeavor that puts singer/guitarist Tyler Connolly, guitarist Dave Brenner and bassist Dean Back high in the rock pantheon, achieving creative growth without sacrificing the hard-hitting power that got them here in the first place.\n\n&quot;It's the Scars &amp; Souvenirs of your life,&quot; Connolly explains. &quot;The songwriting on the record is really about someoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s past or and present, their relationships and how they shape everything. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more metaphorical than physical scars and trophies.WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just a hard-working band, man. We want to be out there for a couple of years and play these songs to everybody we possibly can.&quot; Tyler also contributed guitar and appeared in the video for Chad KroegerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s #1 smash hit &quot;Hero,&quot; the theme song to the massive Spider-Man movie.\n\nTracks:\n\n01  So Happy\n02  By The Way\n03  Got It Made\n04  Not Meant To Be\n05  Crutch\n06  All Or Nothing\n07  Heaven [Little By Little]\n08  Bad Girlfriend\n09  Hate My Life\n10  Little Smirk\n11  End Of The Summer\n12  Wait For Me\n13  Sacrifice\n\nEnjoy, SvC\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebb0ee5ede58a5fe931d2c8fbb5747992bdf1d0f","amp;dn":"Theory+Of+A+Deadman+-+Scars+%26+Souvenirs+%5B2008-mp3-320%5D+%5BSvC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebb0ee5ede58a5fe931d2c8fbb5747992bdf1d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,176,238,94,222,88,165,254,147,29,44,143,187,87,71,153,43,223,29,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
