The story is told in flashback and from Christie's point of view at two distinctly different times in her life - one through the sessions she had with her psychiatrist after her famous 11 day disappearance in 1926 and the other through recollections she give at interviews with journalists on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the West End run of her play The Mousetrap.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab4ce1a20b840c657e42fb97b17e767ba0822417","amp;dn":"Agatha+Christie+A+Life+in+Pictures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab4ce1a20b840c657e42fb97b17e767ba0822417","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,76,225,162,11,132,12,101,126,66,251,151,177,126,118,123,160,130,36,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
