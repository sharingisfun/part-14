He performed with Billy Lee Riley and Brad Suggs but then in 1959 joined the original Bill Black Combo, recording for the Hi label. He stayed with the band until 1961, when he made his solo chart debut with the instrumental &quot;Tuff,&quot; which made it to the country Top 20. This in turn was followed by a Top 40 hit, &quot;Blues (Stay Away From Me),&quot; and a minor hit for the Santos label, &quot;Sugar Blues.&quot; He had two more hits in the mid-'60s with &quot;Cotton Fields&quot; and &quot;Searchin',&quot; both recorded for Hi. A decade later, he became the subject of the 1974 documentary film, Ace's High. After moving to Nashville in the mid-'70s, Cannon's version of &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot; became a minor hit and was nominated for the Best Country Instrumental Performance Grammy that year. Cannon continued to perform into the '90s and frequently toured with such legends of early rock &amp; roll as Carl Perkins.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ace-cannon-p16279/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ace-cannon-p16279/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:dbfuxql5ldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:dbfuxql5ldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DSY2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DSY2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
