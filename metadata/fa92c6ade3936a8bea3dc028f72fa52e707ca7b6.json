What\nwe offer here is our interpretation, based on deep reading,\nextensive research, interviews with the series' creators and a healthy\ndollop of common sense.\n\nIn this book you'll find critical analyses of the series as a whole,\nits themes, characters, covers and even individual panels themselves.\nThe series is analyzed volume by volume, issue by issue. Implicit in\nthe author/reader relationship for this book is that you have\nalready read the complete series. Anarchy For the Masses is a\ncompanion to an understanding of THE INVISIBLES, not a substitute\nfor it. Brief summaries are included of each issue and the two\nshort stories for readers who may have gaps in their personal\ncollections - although of course we recommend obtaining the\ntrade paperback compilations published by DC/Vertigo. But\nbecause the reader is assumed to already be familiar with THE\nINVISIBLES, individual chapters may make reference to future\nevents and themes without pause.&quot;\n\n     -Introduction to Anarchy For The Masses The Disinformation Guide To The Invisibles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa92c6ade3936a8bea3dc028f72fa52e707ca7b6","amp;dn":"Anarchy+For+The+Masses+OCR+%28Grant+Morrison%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa92c6ade3936a8bea3dc028f72fa52e707ca7b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,146,198,173,227,147,106,139,234,61,192,40,247,47,165,46,112,124,167,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
