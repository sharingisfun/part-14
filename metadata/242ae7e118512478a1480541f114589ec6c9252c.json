Dombrowski\nCategory: Academic/Philosophy/Religion\nPublisher: State University of New York Press (April 30, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0791462846\nISBN-13: 978-0791462843\n\nPromotional info/Publisher's summary - &quot;A Platonic Philosophy of Religion challenges traditional views of Plato's religious thought, arguing that these overstate the case for the veneration of Being as opposed to Becoming. Daniel A. Dombrowski explores how process or neoclassical perspectives on Plato's view of God have been mostly neglected, impoverishing both our view of Plato and our view of what can be said in contemporary philosophy of religion on a Platonic basis. Looking at the largely ignored later dialogues, Dombrowski finds a dynamic theism in Plato and presents a new and very different Platonic philosophy of religion. The work's interpretive framework derives from the application of process philosophy and discusses the continuation of Plato's thought in the works of Hartshorne and Whitehead.&quot;\n\nThis torrent contains a scanned copy of the book in PDF format.
