Now We Hurry On (6:49)\n\nBeth Tacular and Phil Moore Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a nature-loving, woods-dwelling, earnestly creative pair who comprise two-thirds of indie folk trio Bowerbirds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are not the sort of couple on whom you'd wish calamity. But when the result of broken ribs, serious illness, break-up and reconciliation is an album as gorgeous as this, you half-wish the hardships keep coming. Their songs on this, their third record, are more expansive, bolder and stranger than those that have come before: like life, they're also messy and loosely formed, swelling and subsiding in ways that sound both slapdash and irresistibly serendipitous.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6122e0fba859cbdce292e9dc4dc8cad2418f09ba","amp;dn":"Bowerbirds+-+The+Clearing+%5B2012%5D+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6122e0fba859cbdce292e9dc4dc8cad2418f09ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,34,224,251,168,89,203,220,226,146,233,220,77,200,202,210,65,143,9,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
