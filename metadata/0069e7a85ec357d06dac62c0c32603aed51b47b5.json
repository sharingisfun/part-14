Characteristic of Pharoah's other work at this time, &quot;Black Unity&quot; rides an often static bass figure. In this way, while the improvisations may evoke the reflective or the frantic, an assertive central theme pervades in the lower register: determination (Does &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; rear its head towards the end?). The harmony is sparse, yet a profound sense of movement permeates throughout. Add exciting cymbal work, care of Billy Hart or Norman Connors, and the mix is complete. Black Unity is a true highlight among Sanders' Avant-Garde articulations of Black cultural visions[\n\nTracklist\n1 Black Unity  37:21\n\nRecorded at A &amp; R Recording Studios, New York, New York on November 24, 1971.
