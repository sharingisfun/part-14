T. A. Hoffmann's (1776-1822) finest short stories vividly demonstrates his intense imagination and preoccupation with the supernatural, placing him at the forefront of both surrealism and the modern horror genre. Suspense dominates tales such as &quot;Mademoiselle de Scudery&quot;, in which an apprentice goldsmith and a female novelist find themselves caught up in a series of jewel thefts and murders. \n\nIn the sinister &quot;The Sandman&quot;, famously used by Sigmund Freud to illustrate both his concept of the unheimlich, or 'uncanny', and of Oedipal guilt, a young man's sanity is tormented by fears about a mysterious chemist; while in &quot;The Choosing of a Bride&quot; a greedy father preys on the weaknesses of his daughter's suitors. Master of the bizarre, Hoffman creates a sinister and unsettling world combining love and madness, black humour and bewildering illusion.\n\nWorth keeping in mind a warning from an Amazon review: &quot;A word of advice to anyone thinking of buying the Penguin Classics version of these talesÃ¢â‚¬â€donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t! It dates from 1982, but the introduction could easily have been written in 1882, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s criminally thin; it contains no critical analysis or discussion of context, but is simply a brief account of the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. \n\nThere are no notes. And the translator, a certain R.J. Hollingdale, admits to having done some Ã¢â‚¬Å“editorializingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ during translation to improve the rhythms of the original, which he thinks a little slow for the modern English reader.&quot;\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction\nMademoiselle de Scudery\nThe Sandman\nThe Artushof\nCouncillor Krespel\nThe Entail\nDoge and Dogaressa\nThe Mines at Falun\nThe Choosing of the Bride\n\nGenre: Horror | Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc29187d57733413db8999d7d104c9d3f1bbdc5d","amp;dn":"Tales+of+Hoffmann+by+E.+T.+A.+Hoffmann","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc29187d57733413db8999d7d104c9d3f1bbdc5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,41,24,125,87,115,52,19,219,137,153,215,209,4,201,211,241,187,220,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
