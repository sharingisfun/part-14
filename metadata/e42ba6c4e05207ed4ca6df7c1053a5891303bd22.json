She established a successful international recording career featuring characteristically Latin-flavoured jazz-pop crossover songs during the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly in the United States, Japan, England and France. \nmore on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basia_Trzetrzelewska\n\n\n\nBasia&amp;#039;s Discography:\n1987 Time And Tide \n1990 London Warsaw New York \n1990 The Best Remixes (Japonia) \n1991 The Best Remixes II (Japonia) - missing in this torrent\n1991 Brave New Hope \n1994 The Sweetest Illusion \n1995 Basia On Broadway \n1998 Clear Horizon - The Best Of Basia \n\n\nMatt Bianco is a UK band that was formed in 1983, by the late Kito Poncioni (bass), Mark Reilly (vocals), and Danny White (keyboards), in 1982, out of the shards of the abandoned art poppers Blue Rondo A La Turk, for their first album Whose Side Are You On? they hired then unknown Polish vocalist Basia Trzetrzelewska. Her vocal arrangements gave the album a jazzy dimension that Reilly and White could not anticipate, but made good use of. Mixmaster Phil Harding applied what would become his signature style to the recordings. Hits like &quot;Get Out of Your Lazy Bed&quot; and &quot;Half a Minute&quot; (which Basia would feature live throughout her solo career) turned Matt Bianco into one of the biggest acts of Europe in 1984. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Bianco&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Bianco&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMatt Bianco&amp;#039;s Discography\n1984 - Whose Side Are You On? \n1986 - Matt Bianco \n1988 - Indigo \n1991 - Samba in Your Casa \n1991 - The Best of Matt Bianco: 1983-1990 \n1994 - Another Time Another Place \n1995 - Gran Via \n1998 - World Go Round \n2000 - Rico\n2002 - Echoes \n2004 - Matt&amp;#039;s Mood \n\n\nAlbums taken from different websites. \nMostly 320 kbps with covers (only one - 128kbps)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42ba6c4e05207ed4ca6df7c1053a5891303bd22","amp;dn":"Basia+and+Matt+Bianco+-+Discography+%281984-2004%29+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42ba6c4e05207ed4ca6df7c1053a5891303bd22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,43,166,196,224,82,7,237,76,166,223,124,16,83,165,137,19,3,189,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
