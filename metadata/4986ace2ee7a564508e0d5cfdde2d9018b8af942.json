There are also a few non-English movies which have hardcoded English subs; if you don't want those you'll have to download your own copy of the movie. However, if there are any English movies with hardcoded subs, please let me know.\n\nI also recommend using VLC for playing them, as it should be compatible with all of the subtitle setups.\n\nSome special exceptions to the movies (in order of rank):\n\n#3 - The Godfather Pt. II is in .mp4 format. Get over it.\n#4 - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the EXTENDED EDITION\n#15 - Goodfellas is the SPECIAL EDITION\n#42 - Taxi Driver is the COLLECTERS EDITION\n#47 - Spirited Away is ENGLISH DUBBED (the original language is Japanese)\n#63 - Das Boot is the UNCUT EDITION, and is also split into 3 parts\n#73 - Cinema Paradiso is in .mp4 format. Get over it.\n#85 - Full Metal Jacket is the RESTORED EDITION\n#93 - Metropolis is the RESTORED EDITION\n#107 - Princess Mononoke is ENGLISH DUBBED (the original language is Japanese)\n#117 - Blade Runner is the REMASTERED DIRECTOR'S CUT\n#124 - Grave of the Fireflies is ENGLISH DUBBED (the original language is Japanese), but can be toggled between the two languages by selecting a different audio track\n#125 - Ran is in .mkv format. Get over it. The subs are also embedded within the file\n#149 - Scarface is the UNCUT AND COLLECTORS' EDITION\n#157 - Groundhog Day is the SPECIAL EDITION\n#169 - Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is in .m4v format. Get over it.\n#184 - My Neighbour Totoro is ENGLISH DUBBED (the original language is Japanese), but can be toggled between the two languages by selecting a different audio track\n#212 - Fanny and Alexander is the LONG VERSION, it's the original miniseries which was rleased as one movie, not the 188-minute theatrical release\n#221 - Magnolia is in .mkv format. Get over it.\n#222 - Nights of Cabiria is in .mkv format. Get over it.\n#240 - His Girl Friday is the REMASTERED EDITION\n#250 - Castle in the Sky is ENGLISH DUBBED (the original language is Japanese)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4986ace2ee7a564508e0d5cfdde2d9018b8af942","amp;dn":"Official++IMDb++Top++250++Movies++Collection++6%2F17%2F2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4986ace2ee7a564508e0d5cfdde2d9018b8af942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,134,172,226,238,122,86,69,8,224,213,207,221,226,217,1,139,138,249,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
