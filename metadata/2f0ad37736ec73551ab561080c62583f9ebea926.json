It was released on September 18, 2012.[1] It is the first album featuring bassist Pat Bruders due to the departure of former bassist Rex Brown in 2011, and the last to feature guitarist Kirk Windstein, who left in 2013.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Background\n    2 Lyrics and style\n    3 Reception\n        3.1 Critical\n        3.2 Commercial\n    4 Track listing\n    5 Personnel\n    6 Charts\n    7 References\n\nBackground\n\nIn January 2012, Philip Anselmo announced that the band have been recording songs in the studio since October 2011. The band plans to release a series of EPs over the next few years. On May 21, 2012, Down performed &quot;Misfortune Teller&quot; for the first time in North Carolina. On July 26, 2012, another new song, &quot;Witchtripper&quot; was made available for streaming. It was made available for purchase on iTunes on July 31, 2012. The band revealed the artwork and title of their first EP to be Down IV Part I Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Purple EP in July 2012.\nLyrics and style\n\nWith the EP, the band decided to go back to its roots and earlier style of song writing that was most prominent on the band's debut album. Much of the work was done at Anselmo's barn named &quot;Nodferatu's Lair&quot;, where the band recorded their entire second album, Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow. Influences such as Black Sabbath, Trouble and Witchfinder General would play a significant role in the writing process with the EP containing traces of doom metal and southern rock influences, giving the EP a dark, raw and ominous feel.\n\nAnselmo described the album as:\n\n    &quot;very stripped down. Nothing flashy. Straight to the pointÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ really just DOWN music. If you liked the first record, the demosÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ something like thatÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ This record, we're pretty dead straight and honest and on the money as far as making it as simple and direct as possible and I think we did that. . . It has that practice-room vibe to it. We didn't really try and fucking slick it out and anything. We went the more raw route, as far as an approach.&quot;\n\nThe lyrics tackle subjects outside of just personal experiences unlike most of the band's previous work, exploring such themes as the faith and imperfection of mankind, and cultural belief systems.\nReception\nCritical\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nAbout.com \t3.5/5 stars[8]\nArtistdirect \t5/5 stars[9]\nBlabbermouth.net \t8.5/10[10]\nBrave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles \t9.0/10[11]\nCraveOnline \t7.5/10[12]\nExclaim! \tfavorable[13]\nLoudwire \t5/5 stars[14]\nPopMatters \t6/10[15]\n\nThe EP was well received by critics. Artistdirect.com and Loudwire both giving the EP a perfect 5 out of 5 star rating. Natalie Zed of About.com gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars in her review. She stated:\n\n    &quot;While the sound of this record is classic Down, delivered without experimentation or flourish, the form of the album is where the band allow themselves freedom to explore, and very successfully. The Purple EP is at once extremely satisfying, but also leaves the listener hungry and wanting more Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a fine balance.&quot; Huh,I always want more songs from them. \n\nCommercial\n\nReleased on September 18, 2012, nearly 17 years after their debut album NOLA, The Purple EP debut on the Billboard 200 at number 35, number 15 on the Rock Albums chart, number 7 on the Independent Albums chart, and topped the Hard Rock Albums chart all in the week on October 6, 2012. The album peaked at number 57 on the UK Albums Chart.\nTrack listing\n\nAll lyrics written by Phil Anselmo, all music composed by Down.\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Levitation&quot;   \t4:58\n2. \t&quot;Witchtripper&quot;   \t3:49\n3. \t&quot;Open Coffins&quot;   \t5:43\n4. \t&quot;The Curse Is a Lie&quot;   \t6:00\n5. \t&quot;This Work Is Timeless&quot;   \t3:43\n6. \t&quot;Misfortune Teller&quot;   \t9:05\nTotal length:\n\t33:18 \t\nPersonnel\n\nDown\n\n    Philip Anselmo Ã¢Ë†â€™ lead vocals\n    Pepper Keenan Ã¢Ë†â€™ guitar\n    Kirk Windstein Ã¢Ë†â€™ guitar\n    Patrick Bruders Ã¢Ë†â€™ bass\n    Jimmy Bower Ã¢Ë†â€™ drums\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n    Ross Karpelman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n\nCharts\nYear \tChart \tPosition\n2012 \tU.S. Billboard 200\t35\nUK Albums Chart\t57\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f0ad37736ec73551ab561080c62583f9ebea926","amp;dn":"Down+IV+Pt.1-+The+Purple+-+EP+320k++mp3++ak2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f0ad37736ec73551ab561080c62583f9ebea926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,10,211,119,54,236,115,85,26,181,97,8,12,98,88,63,158,190,169,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
