As the series progresses Vincent is able to convince a small number of people to help him fight the aliens. It was notable that normally at least one individual, often a key figure, such as a USAF intelligence officer ('The Innocent'), a police officer ('Genesis', 'The Spores'), a U.S. Army major ('Doomsday Minus One'), or a NASA official ('Moonshot') would become aware of the alien threat and survive the episode in which he or she was introduced.\nThe Invaders, alien beings from a dying planet. Their destination: the Earth. Their purpose: to make it their world. David Vincent has seen them. For him, it began one lost night on a lonely country road, looking for a shortcut that he never found. It began with a closed deserted diner, and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey. It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy. Now David Vincent knows that the Invaders are here, that they have taken human form. Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun.[1]\n\nAspect Ratio 624x400 = 600x400\nFrame Rate 25\nBit Rate 700\nCodec MP4\nAudio AAC 93","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b65853dbc16da34a626f476df0cb657fb5968c0c","amp;dn":"The.Invaders.%281967%29.Season.01.MP4-AJAXEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b65853dbc16da34a626f476df0cb657fb5968c0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,88,83,219,193,109,163,74,98,111,71,109,240,203,101,127,181,150,140,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
