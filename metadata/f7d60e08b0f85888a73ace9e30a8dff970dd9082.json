Install Macrium Reflect x86 for 32 bit operating system and x64 for 64 bit operating system\r\n2. Copy the path file (x86 for 32bit version and x64 for 64bit version) to the installed folder\r\n3. Patch and it's done\r\nNOTE: Please block the application from connecting to the internet using a firewall, preventing issues with the crack.\r\n\r\nWhat's New:\r\n\r\nDelta Incremental Index\r\n\r\nThis new feature optimises the size of each index associated with incremental backups as they only contain a list of changed blocks in the incremental itself. This even further improves the backup and recovery speeds and reduces the amount of storage required to store backups.\r\n\r\nGerman Language Support\r\n\r\nOur international customer base is continually expanding and weâ€™re working hard in-house to ensure that we support as many countries and languages as possible. German language support is now available and stay tuned for regular releases in other new languages in the near future.\r\n\r\nReflect supports Windows PE 10\r\n\r\nMacrium Reflect now also supports Windows PE 10. This is especially important as with the recent release of Windows 10, PE 10 is now the default PE option for installations on Windows 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2012, 2012R2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7d60e08b0f85888a73ace9e30a8dff970dd9082","amp;dn":"Macrium+Reflect+Workstation+-+Server+-+Server+Plus+v6.1.871","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7d60e08b0f85888a73ace9e30a8dff970dd9082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,214,14,8,176,248,88,136,167,58,206,158,48,168,223,249,112,221,144,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
