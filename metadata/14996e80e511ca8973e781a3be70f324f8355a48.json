The game is set in a futuristic star system Algo, with three planets - Palma, Motavia, and Dezoris. The world is controlled by an evil dictator called Lassic. Anyone who opposes him is mercilessly executed. You control Alis, a young girl whose brother was killed by Lassic. She swears to avenge his death, and this is where her adventure begins.\n\nThe remake maintains most cardinal aspects of the original, including story, characters, battle system, 3D dungeons, and graphical style. Changes include updated graphics (pre-rendered for towns and overworld, real-time 3D for dungeons), more dialogue and characterization (you can now talk to your party members), as well as gameplay-related changes: there are more weapons, more levels to gain for the characters, additional items and spells, as well as combo attacks which can be performed by equipping various crystals in addition to a fitting weapon.\n\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nIf Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.\n(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14996e80e511ca8973e781a3be70f324f8355a48","amp;dn":"Phantasy+Star+Generation+1+%5BNTSC-J%5D+%5BEnglish+Patched%5D+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14996e80e511ca8973e781a3be70f324f8355a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,153,110,128,229,17,202,137,115,231,129,163,190,112,243,36,248,53,90,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
