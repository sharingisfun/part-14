ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen I was growing up there was a beach town called Patonga that my\nfamily would go to every year. The song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The SummerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is based on that town.\nEveryday I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d jump in a canoe and paddle up the river and set crab traps, or jig\nfor squid from the wharf or get my dad to drive me to the next town to go\nsurfing. I always think of those simple pleasures as the ultimate happiness, and\nso I think I relate solid, seafaring adventuring tales as the romantic,\nalternate universe that I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d want to live in if I was ever to throw it all away\nand disappear.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe album is more than a simple ode to seafaring though. Pyke traverses an ocean\nof memories, ideas and thoughts about everyday concerns, with stability and the\nnotion of making up your own mind emerging as overriding themes.\nHe explores the concept of a home, what it means and why it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important; fate,\nand whether there is a plan for us all; getting older and what it means to\nsettle down; responsibility; being careless or careful with people and the\nlegacy one leaves when they go. While these concepts arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly unchartered\nmusical territory, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s PykeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique way with words, sense of melody and quirky\nsong structures though that set him apart from other singer/songwriters.\n\nWith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ChimneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s AfireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, Pyke is set to anchor himself as one AustraliaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most\ntalented artists. While he co-produced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Memories &amp; DustÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ with Wayne Connolly\n(resulting in an ARIA Award for Producer of the Year), this time around he\nrecorded and produced the majority of the record himself. In the studio, Pyke\nwould perform the songs then dash into the control room to compile in Pro-Tools,\nas well as arrange the songs and direct the additional musicians.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe main challenge was switching roles a million times a day and not losing\nthat sense of fun when I was doing the performance side, and not losing the\nsense of objectivity when I had my producerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hat on.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nWhile other artists have chosen to self-produce records because they havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\nbeen happy with earlier albums, this wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the case for Pyke.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned so much from people like Wayne Connolly, and I want to produce\nother artists in the future, so it seemed like the natural progression to\ndevelop my skills on my own record. At least that way if I was no good it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d be\nmy own record and not someone elseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d be ruining!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nBoth Connolly and Paul McKercher (Augie March, You Am I) co-produced a pair of\nsongs each, while the album was mixed by both Rob Schnapf (Elliott Smith, Beck,\nThe Vines) in Los Angeles and McKercher in Sydney.\n\nP.S.
