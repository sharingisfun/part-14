It was shown on UK's Channel 4 from September to October 2001. Each\nshow had a rough theme, often somewhat existentialist in nature, around\nwhich Iannucci would weave a series of surreal sketches and monologues.\n\nRecurring themes in the episodes are the superficiality of modern culture,\nour problems communicating with each other, the mundane nature of working\nlife and feelings of personal inadequacy and social awkwardness. Several\ncharacters also make repeat appearances in the shows, including the East\nEnd thug, who solves every problem with threats of violence; Hugh, an old\nman who delivers surreal monologues about what things were like in the old\ndays; and Iannucci's barber, who is full of nonsensical anecdotes.\n\nVideo\n-----\nCodec: H264 / MPEG-4 AVC (part 10)\nResolution: 704560\nFrame rate: 25\n\nAudio\n-----\nCodec: MPEG AAC Audio\nLanguage: English\nChannels: Stereo\nSample rate: 48000Hz\n\nCREW SHOUTZ N GREETZ\n\naXXo, BallyD, C-Bomb, a$$men$, MancPaul89, Jay_Hawk, Trevor9Zone,\ncrackaLuv, tr0, B3NDone, the_inception, D0NNIE, Relentless, X2C,\nPipelayer,Pressure, Satisfaktion\n\nClose like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch\nDare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3\n\nPeace Love,\nfrom Shadow Demon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e9a46e69965157d66a66963c67f5727da6b570","amp;dn":"The+Armando+Iannucci+Shows+-+Series+1+-+Shadow+Demon+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e9a46e69965157d66a66963c67f5727da6b570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,233,164,110,105,150,81,87,214,106,102,150,60,103,245,114,125,166,181,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
