Meanwhile, Aragorn [Viggo Mortensen], Legolas\n[Orlando Bloom], and Gimli [John Rhys-Davies] join in the defense of the people of Rohan,\nwho are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman\n(Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron. Fantastic creatures, astounding visual effects,\nand a climactic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep make The Two Towers a worthy\nsuccessor to The Fellowship of the Ring, grander in scale but retaining the story's emotional\nintimacy.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/96098675609279655364.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/96098675609279655364.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54927477253328676629.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54927477253328676629.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12750945828574314019.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12750945828574314019.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/84043219641750260102.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/84043219641750260102.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/18911844744865094185.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/18911844744865094185.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nReview [c/o amazon]\n\nI already reviewed the regular &quot;Motion Picture Trilogy&quot; containing the non-extended editions\nof the legendary Lord of The Rings masterpieces on one set. However, this newest edition is\na grand improvement on the previous edition. This item is a much, MUCH better investment\nthan the old theatrical counterparts and is perhaps the greatest DVD purchase one will likely\never make.\n\nA lot &quot;Director's Cut&quot; scenes are usually just added footage that doesn't do a whole lot to add\nonto the theatrical edition of movies with examples like Star Wars, Manhunter, or even most\nof the &quot;Aliens&quot; movies as well. The extra material is just that, extras, that wouldn't kill me to\nnever see again.\n\nIt's a totally different story altogether with the &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; movies altogether. While\nthe regular theatrical editions were mind-blowing, the extended cuts of the same films do\nwonders in fleshing out the story and expanding the characters a lot more. Several characters\nthat were not much more than background people are shown much more screen time, stories\nare greatly expanded, other scenes are much more meaningful, and the movies overall have\na totally different feel altogether thanks to all of the extra footage that was not included on the\ntheatrical editions. Now as I watch them, the old editions of them are rendered almost\ncompletely obsolete due to the chopped up nature of them. I sometimes wonder if Peter\nJackson grimaced when he had to leave a lot of extra shots out of the movies to fit them onto\nthe theatres when they were released.\n\n&quot;Fellowship&quot; has 30 minutes of extra footage included to a length of 3 and a half hours. &quot;The\nTwo Towers&quot; was extended 43 minutes to a total of 3 hours and 42 minutes and finally &quot;The\nReturn of The King&quot; is extended by a grand 50 minutes and the ultimate result is a whopping\n4 hours and 11 minutes long! I don't know about you but I don't know how one can make a\nlonger movie like this but Jackson did it! The grand total of all three extended editions is at\nleast an astronomical 11 hours long! This is just the movies themselves.\n\nAs for all of the extras on the &quot;Extended Editions&quot;, there are over a days worth of extras for\nsurf through on the latter two discs of each film set. The things on them are too great to\nexplain in detail with this review.\n\nWhether you buy them individually or all at once on this massive gift set, &quot;The Lord of The\nRings&quot; trilogy goes down as the greatest trilogy of all time. You could not make a better\npurchase.
