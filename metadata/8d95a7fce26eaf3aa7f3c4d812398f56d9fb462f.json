In Weapons of Mass Diplomacy, diplomat Abel Lanzac reveals the tension and politics through a French insider's point of view, with satirical humor that softens the controversial subject matter. A graphic milestone of diplomacy, Weapons of Mass Diplomacy, a bestseller in Europe, provides a revelatory account of a period that saw French fries become 'freedom fries' and an alternative perspective on the decisions leading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d95a7fce26eaf3aa7f3c4d812398f56d9fb462f","amp;dn":"Weapons+of+Mass+Diplomacy+%282014%29+%28Minutemen-Nweako%29.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d95a7fce26eaf3aa7f3c4d812398f56d9fb462f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,149,167,252,226,110,175,58,167,243,196,216,18,57,143,86,217,251,70,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
