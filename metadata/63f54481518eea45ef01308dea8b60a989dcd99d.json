In this day and age of &quot;wham, bam, thank you ma&amp;#039;am&quot; no-brainer action films and simpering synthetic rom coms, it was such a relief to have an intelligent film with characters that needed to be understood rather than handed out on a plate, that was beautiful but still harsh and brutal in its intensity.\n\nIt was a pleasure to watch. I for one am exceedingly grateful that it was nothing like &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (a pale comparison) and for once, which is unusual for Hollywood, historically accurate or as accurate as you can be in the 21st century. I am not a great historian of the period though I do have an interest in the Crusades, but I recently read another review of this film that praised it&amp;#039;s historical accuracy -\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f54481518eea45ef01308dea8b60a989dcd99d","amp;dn":"Soldier.Of.God.2005.DVDRip.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f54481518eea45ef01308dea8b60a989dcd99d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,245,68,129,81,142,234,69,239,1,48,141,234,139,96,169,137,220,217,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
