They are Apple's preferred format for distributing Mac software. Disk images are also the only archive format whose contents you can directly access in the Finder.\n\nDropDMG is the easiest way to create Mac OS X disk images, as well as cross-platform archives. Just drag and drop a folder or file and you're done. Or, you can drag an existing disk image or archive onto DropDMG to convert it to any of the other supported formats or to burn it to CD or DVD.\n\nDropDMG supports advanced options such as encrypted and segmented disk images, WYSIWYG layout with background pictures and custom volume icons, and rich-text license agreements in multiple languages. There are many time-saving features, and it can also be automated via AppleScript, the command-line, and Automator.\n\nWhats new:\n\nDropDMG no longer posts errors to Notification Center. Instead, if DropDMG is not frontmost, it will bounce the Dock icon to alert you of an error.\nMade some code signing changes for better compatibility with Mac OS X 10.9.\nDropDMG is better at detecting errors when setting the background picture and arranging the icons.\nFixed a bug that could cause a crash when using DropDMGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Automator action.\nFixed a bug that could cause an internal error when creating a hybrid disk image if the layouts preferences were open.\nFixed a bug where DropDMG could report an error when converting a disk image from .iso format to .dmg if the destination file already existed.\nUpdated the sample AppleScripts.\nUpdated the French localisation.\n\nPatch courtesy of Special K","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bb714d3fbea83ab1e2a82da64fb3030d074432a","amp;dn":"DropDMG+v3.2.4+Special+K+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bb714d3fbea83ab1e2a82da64fb3030d074432a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,183,20,211,251,234,131,171,30,42,130,218,100,251,48,48,208,116,67,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
