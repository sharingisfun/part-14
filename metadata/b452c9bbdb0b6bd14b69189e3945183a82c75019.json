This volume combines, for the first time in English, five of these works: The Antichrist, Ecce Homo, Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche contra Wagner, and The Case of Wagner. Nietzsche takes on some of his greatest adversaries in these works: traditional religion, contemporary culture, and above all, his one-time hero, Richard Wagner. His writing is simultaneously critical and creative, revealing his alternative philosophical vision, which, after more than a hundred years, still retains its audacious originality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b452c9bbdb0b6bd14b69189e3945183a82c75019","amp;dn":"Nietzsche+-+Anti-Christ%2C+Ecce+Homo%2C+Twilight+of+the+Idols+%28CUP%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b452c9bbdb0b6bd14b69189e3945183a82c75019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,82,201,187,219,11,107,209,75,105,24,158,57,69,24,58,130,199,80,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
