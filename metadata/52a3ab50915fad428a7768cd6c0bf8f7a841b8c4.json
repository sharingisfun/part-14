Author Peter Bergen is CNN's terrorism analyst, and an acclaimed journalist who actually spent time with bin Laden prior to the events of September 11, 2001. It features interviews with people from each stage of bin LadenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life-from childhood to the present day-and reveals both formative moments and intimate details that reveal his character and personality. The only book of its kind, this is the authoritative account of al Qaeda's notorious leader.\n\n\nIt is a comprehensive collection of personal accounts by people who have met bin Laden or worked with him at various stages of his terrorist career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52a3ab50915fad428a7768cd6c0bf8f7a841b8c4","amp;dn":"THE+OSAMA+BIN+LADEN+I+KNOW+-+Peter+Bergen.+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52a3ab50915fad428a7768cd6c0bf8f7a841b8c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,163,171,80,145,95,173,66,138,119,104,205,108,11,248,247,168,65,184,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
