How can a routine bathroom fixture be considered a work of art? Shouldn\\'t a novel have a beginning, a middle, and an end--or at least a story? In this Very Short Introduction, Christopher Butler provides a coherent account of Modernism across various aesthetic and cultural fields. Butler examines how and why Modernism began, explaining what it is and showing how virtually all aspects of 20th and 21st century life have been influenced by its aesthetic legacy. Butler considers several aspects of modernism, including some classic modernist works, movements and notions of the avant garde, and the idea of \\&quot;progress\\&quot; in art. Finally, Butler sheds light on modernist ideas of the self, subjectivity, irrationalism, people and machines, and the political dimensions of modernism as a whole.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:512b92b66583b1a977ec8de616ed4acb6336268a","amp;dn":"Modernism%3A+A+Very+Short+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"512b92b66583b1a977ec8de616ed4acb6336268a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,43,146,182,101,131,177,169,119,236,141,230,22,237,74,203,99,54,38,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
