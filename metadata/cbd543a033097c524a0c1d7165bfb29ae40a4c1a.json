All of the new Unisols, which are faster and stronger than their predecessors, are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called SETH, a Self-Evolving Thought Helix. When SETH discovers that the Universal Soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts, he takes matters into his own &quot;hands&quot; to protect himself. Killing those who try to shut off his power, and unleashing his platoon of super-soldiers, led by the musclebound Romeo, SETH spares Deveraux, only because Deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built-in program that will shut SETH down in a matter of hours. With the help of a hacker named Squid, SETH takes human form. Not only must Luc contend with ambitious reporter Erin, who won&amp;#039;t leave his side, but Luc also must contend with General Radford, who wants to take extreme measures to stop SETH. SETH has also kidnapped Luc&amp;#039;s injured 13-year-old daughter Hillary, and is now holding her hostage. Luc is the only person who can rescue Hillary, because Luc knows firsthand how a UniSol thinks, feels, and fights.\n\nCast: Jean-Claude Van Damme    ... \tLuc Deveraux\n\n      Michael Jai White\t       ... \tS.E.T.H.\n\n      Heidi Schanz             ... \tErin Young, KTXD\n\n      Xander Berkeley          ... \tDr. Dylan Cotner\n\n      Justin Lazard\t       ... \tCaptain Blackburn\n\n      Kiana Tom                ... \tMaggie\n   \n      Bill Goldberg            ... \tRomeo / UniSol 2500\n\n      Brent Hinkley            ... \tSquid\n\nPlz seed after dlding and do comment on the quality of the rip.\nFor movie requests leave them as comments.
