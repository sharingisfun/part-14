Not only have they lost founding member, singer and once-chief songwriter Sam Genders, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve added a new lyricist, renewed their acquaintance with electronic experimentation and embraced their inner adventurer. And, like all revolutions before they turn into despotic dictatorships, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been a revealing, liberating experience.\n\nIt wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t easy, however. Troubled by collective writersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ block, they embarked on a tour last year with desert bluesmen Tinariwen, finding common ground in their very different musical heritages that produced a snaky, loose-limbed hybrid of both bandsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ work that freed up their minds. Their asses, as George Clinton once predicted, soon followed, and after three albums that gradually toned down the blips and squelches, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦And Then We Saw Land is littered with electronic flourishes which take Tunng far beyond the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“folktronicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ tag theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been handed. In fact, if you look at it from the other direction, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve become less a folk band with bleepy bits and more the acoustic Hot Chip.\nThis set is dazzling in its breadth. The most traditional track here, the almost a cappella These Winds, could be a group of pub singers by a forest inn fireside, and yet itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sandwiched between By Dusk They Were in the City, which features a Thin Lizzy-esque guitar solo, and Santiago, which circles a cute synth melody and looped handclaps. And then there is The Roadside. If it was played by robots it would be hailed as Kraftwerk at their epic best; if it was shrouded in layers of guitars small indie boys would be throwing their caps in the air that SpiritualizedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s return was nigh. But it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largely acoustic but has all the repetitive, explosive, shuddering and gliding hallmarks of a Motorik classic or an indie gospel masterpiece.\n\nThroughout, there is a sense of rebirth, nowhere more so than in the voice of Becky Jacobs. This is the first time on an album sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s taken centre stage, and her new-found confidence swims through everything else.\nTunng were always the eccentric cousins of British folk: a band born in a basement that played seat-of-the-pants shows with Malian freedom fighters, at ease with traditional folk music as cut up loops and samples. That, however, is a world theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve outgrown. Instead of shadowing the pack, this album puts them right up the fronT.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/02/14/3122/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b8105ab6b992f14d126de1ec8aa9ba4c00e0e46","amp;dn":"Tunng...And+Then+We+Saw+Land%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b8105ab6b992f14d126de1ec8aa9ba4c00e0e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,129,5,171,107,153,47,20,209,38,222,30,200,170,155,164,192,14,14,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
