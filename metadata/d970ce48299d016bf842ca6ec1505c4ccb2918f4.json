With Pure Data, a graphical programming environment, creating interactive multimedia applications is just visually connecting graphical icons together. It is straightforward, intuitive, and effective.\n\n&quot;Multimedia Programming with Pure Data&quot; will show you how to create interactive multimedia applications. You will learn how to author various digital media, such as images, animations, audio, and videos together to form a coherent title. From simple to sophisticated interaction techniques, you will learn to apply these techniques in your practical multimedia projects.\n\nYou start from making 2D and 3D computer graphics and proceed to animation, multimedia presentation, interface design, and more sophisticated computer vision applications with interactivity. With Pure Data and GEM, you will learn to produce animations with 2D digital imagery, 3D modelling, and particle systems. You can also design graphical interfaces, and use live video for motion tracking applications. Furthermore, you will learn Audio signal processing, which forms the key aspect to multimedia content creation. Last but not least, Network programming using Pure Data extension libraries explores applications to other portable devices.\n\nWhat you will learn from this book\n\nPrepare computer animations with 2D images, 3D modelling, and geometric transformation.\nProduce imageries with digital image processing techniques.\nDesign graphical interfaces for audio-visual performance.\nDevelop motion detection and tracking applications.\nGenerate interactive animation with particle systems.\nSynthesize audio content for interactive applications.\nConnect Pure Data applications with external devices.\nExtend Pure Data with external libraries for advanced interactive applications.\nApproach\n\nA quick and comprehensive tutorial book for media designers to jump-start interactive multimedia production with computer graphics, digital audio, digital video, and interactivity, using the Pure Data graphical programming environment.\n\nWho this book is written for\n\nAn introductory book on multimedia programming for media artists/designers who like to work on interactivity in their projects, digital art/design students who like to learn the first multimedia programming technique, and audio-visual performers who like to customize their performance sets","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d970ce48299d016bf842ca6ec1505c4ccb2918f4","amp;dn":"Multimedia+Programming+With+Pure+Data+-+Bryan+WC+Chung","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d970ce48299d016bf842ca6ec1505c4ccb2918f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,112,206,72,41,157,1,107,248,66,202,110,193,80,92,76,203,41,24,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
