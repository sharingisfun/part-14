Among the highlight songs are the original version of I Wouldn't Change You If I Could (later a #1 country hit for Ricky Skaggs) and a version of Angel Band that not only preceded the Stanley Brothers' recording, but is regarded by many as the absolutely definitive version of this classic song (later recorded by Emmylou Harris and countless others). Also features recordings with the Webster Bros. , plus a few Webster solos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:318359a82d49b5888ffda8207c274ad0fce21532","amp;dn":"Carl+Butler+-+I+Wouldn%27t+Change+You+If+I+Could+-+Bear+Family+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"318359a82d49b5888ffda8207c274ad0fce21532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,131,89,168,45,73,181,136,143,253,168,32,124,39,74,208,252,226,21,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
