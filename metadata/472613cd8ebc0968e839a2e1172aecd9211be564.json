The Scarlets formed in 1953, while Parris was still in high school. The group had a local hit with &quot;Dear One&quot; the following year. In 1954, Parris formed the Five Satins with vocalists Al Denby, Ed Martin, and Jim Freeman. Within the next year, Parris had the group record &quot;In the Still of the Night,&quot; a song he had recently written in the basement of a local church. The first single the group released was &quot;In the Still of the Night.&quot; The single was released on Standard Records in the spring of 1956. By the end of the year, it had been leased to Ember and became a huge hit, peaking at number three on the R&amp;B charts and number 25 on the pop charts\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.
