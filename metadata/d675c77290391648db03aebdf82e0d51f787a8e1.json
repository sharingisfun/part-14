The Nightguard\n\nDespite her popularity in the metal scene, Haugen's music is often refered to as &quot;ambient/folk/rock/gothic.&quot; She describes &quot;Dead Waters&quot; as &quot;very own, very dark, very organic, very strange. 'Dead Waters' certainly turned out to be more organic, kind of like a mix of dreamy ambient, tribal, and a darker form of country... or something like that... maybe it was the influence of that Texas snake beer we were drinking in the studio (cool stuff!) and the hot weather. The songs, as usual, embrace many of my deep and dark thoughts, dreams... and recent experiences... I have a talent for ending up in unusual, interesting and weird situations... always kinda stressy when it happens... but they always makes the best and entertaining stories afterwards.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/12/nebelhexeandrea-nebel/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/12/nebelhexeandrea-nebel/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d675c77290391648db03aebdf82e0d51f787a8e1","amp;dn":"Nebelhex%C3%83%C2%AB...Dead+Waters%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d675c77290391648db03aebdf82e0d51f787a8e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,117,199,114,144,57,22,72,219,3,174,189,248,46,13,81,247,135,168,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
