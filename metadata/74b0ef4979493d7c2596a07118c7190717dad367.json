It was released in 1977 by Polydor Records and featured the hit single and title track &quot;In the City&quot;.\n\nWeller's guitar style on the album is very much influenced by Wilko Johnson and Pete Townshend.\n\nThe album includes two cover songs, &quot;Slow Down&quot; and the theme to the 1960s television series, Batman, the latter of which had also been previously covered by The Who.\n\nUpon the album's release, In The City received all-round positive reviews. Phil McNeil from the NME said Weller's songwriting &quot;captures that entire teen frustration vibe with the melodic grace and dynamic aplomb of early Kinks and Who&quot;. Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker was equally impressed, proclaiming that &quot;[t]he Weller composed songs are anything but an embarrassement, he has a deft touch that places his material on a much higher plateau&quot;. In the Record Mirror, Barry Cain wrote, &quot;[a]rmed and extremely dangerous The Jam stalk the decrepit grooves. If you don't like them, hard luck they're gonna be around for a long time. It's been a long time since albums actually reflected pre-20 delusions and this one does&quot;.\n\nAll songs by Paul Weller unless otherwise noted.\nTrack listing:-\n\n01-&quot;Art School&quot; (2:02)\n02-&quot;I've Changed My Address&quot; (3:31)\n03-&quot;Slow Down&quot; (2:39) (Larry Williams)\n04-&quot;I Got By in Time&quot; (2:07)\n05-&quot;Away from the Numbers&quot; (4:03)\n06-&quot;Batman Theme&quot; (1:31) (Neal Hefti)\n07-&quot;In the City&quot; (2:19)\n08-&quot;Sounds from the Street&quot; (3:14)\n09-&quot;Non-Stop Dancing&quot; (2:28)\n10-&quot;Time for Truth&quot; (3:10)\n11-&quot;Takin' My Love&quot; (2:15)\n12-&quot;Bricks and Mortar&quot; (2:37)\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b0ef4979493d7c2596a07118c7190717dad367","amp;dn":"The+Jam++-++In+the+City+++%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b0ef4979493d7c2596a07118c7190717dad367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,176,239,73,121,73,61,124,37,150,160,113,24,199,25,7,23,218,211,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
