He is married to Sweety (Rimi Sen). Jai seeks the help of a thief named Ali (Uday Chopra) and devises a trap to catch the gang, but it fails. Kabir (John Abraham), the leader of the gang, eventually taunts Dixit by saying that he couldn\\'t catch him even if he were right in front of him. He is proved correct and the failure of Dixit seemingly leads to the break-up of his partnership with Ali.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f27727a366acd1502c502eb6b9aeaa0687325704","amp;dn":"Dhoom+-+1+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f27727a366acd1502c502eb6b9aeaa0687325704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,119,39,163,102,172,209,80,44,80,46,182,185,174,170,6,135,50,87,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
