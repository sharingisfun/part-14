They were popular sights at the head of semi-fast and freight trains across the Western Region of the British rail network during the 1960s. \n\nA total of 101 models were produced by Beyer Peacock between 1961 and 1964, although their operational life was relatively short Ã¢â‚¬â€œ withdrawals began in 1971 and were completed by 1975. A total of four locomotives have survived into preservation. \n\nThe Class 35 for Train Simulator is available in British Railways green livery and is a former Iron Horse House model, which has been updated to TS2014 standard, including new scenarios and improved exterior modelling. Also included are BR Mk1 passenger coaches in chocolate and cream livery.
