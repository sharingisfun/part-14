P. Lovecraft into calling him Ã¢â‚¬Å“unexcelled by any other writer, dead or livingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or compel Fritz Lieber to employ the worthy term sui generis. Clark Ashton SmithÃ¢â‚¬â€autodidact, prolific poet, amateur philosopher, bizarre sculptor, and unmatched storytellerÃ¢â‚¬â€simply wrote like no one else, before or since. This new collection of his very best tales and poems is selected and introduced by supernatural literature scholar S. T. Joshi and allows readers to encounter SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s visionary brand of fantastical, phantasmagorical worlds, each one filled with invention, terror, and a superlative sense of metaphysical wonder.\n\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d779386e59357346626c2ef080153e326ad191a8","amp;dn":"Clark+Ashton+Smith+-+The+Dark+Eidolon+%26amp%3B+Other+Fantasies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d779386e59357346626c2ef080153e326ad191a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,121,56,110,89,53,115,70,98,108,46,240,128,21,62,50,106,209,145,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
