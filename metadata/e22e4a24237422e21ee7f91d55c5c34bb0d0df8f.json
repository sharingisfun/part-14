He is then saved by Urahara, who agrees to help him rescue Rukia, who faces the death penalty in the Soul Society. Ichigo, however, must agree to train with Urahara to regain his powers. \n\n18 \t&quot;Reclaim! The Power of the Shinigami!&quot;\n\n&quot;Torimodose!

He begins his training at the Urahara Shop, first battling the shop's girl assistant, Ururu Tsumugiya to regain control of his spirit body. As the training enters stage two, Ichigo's soul is cut from his body and thrown into a pit. He must regain his Soul Reaper powers within three days, or risk becoming a hollow. Meanwhile, Yoruichi ShihÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½in, a talking cat, offers to train Chad and Orihime to control and enhance their powers so they can join Ichigo to go to the Soul Society and rescue Rukia. \n\n19 \t&quot;Ichigo Becomes a Hollow!&quot;\n\n&quot;Ichigo, HorÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ ni Ochiru!&quot; (ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¸Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¨Ã‚Â­Ã‚Â·ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â­ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â«ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¢Ã…â€œÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã¢â‚¬Â¹ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¼Ã‚ï¿½)  \t\nFebruary 15, 2005 \t\nJanuary 19, 2007\n\nIn the Soul Society, RukiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sentence is moved up and she only has twenty five days left. In the pit, Ichigo battles through the agony of the process of becoming a hollow. His transformation is almost complete as he enters his own mind, coming face to face with his inner spirit, Zangetsu, who helps him unleash the Soul Reaper powers he was born with. In a powerful display, Ichigo emerges from the pit with his Soul Reaper uniform on, wearing the mask of a hollow. Breaking the mask off, Ichigo enters the next stage of his training, that is to fight Urahara. \n\n20 \t&quot;Gin Ichimaru's Shadow&quot;\n\n&quot;Ichimaru Gin no Kage&quot; (ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¸Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¸Ã‚Â¸ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â®ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â®ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â½Ã‚Â±)  \t\nFebruary 22, 2005 \t\nJanuary 26, 2007\n\nWhile fighting Urahara, Ichigo learns that Zangetsu is the name of his zanpakutÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½.

Orihime and Chad, meanwhile, finish their training with Yoruichi. The entire group, including UryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«, who has been training alone, set out for the Soul Society using a gate Yoruichi and Urahara made.\n\nUploader Notes:\n===============\n\nFormat: .mp4 videos\n\nUse VLC Player for best results.\n\nMy internet speed is slow but I am seeding.
