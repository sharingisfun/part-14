The files are released in this\nformat to give the viewer the greatest flexibility in choosing their preferred\nplayback experience.\n\n\nBackground:\nRather than import The Rebirth three-part mini-series as a conclusion, Takara,\nthe Japanese producers of the Transformers toyline, opted instead to create a\nspin-off of the original series by creating the full-length 35-episode series,\nTransformers: The Headmasters. Supplanting The Rebirth's position in Japanese\ncontinuity, The Headmasters occurred one year after The Return of Optimus Prime,\nintroducing the titular characters to the Transformers universe in a different\nway. Whereas in western fiction, the Headmasters result from the merging of a\nTransformer with an organic alien being from the planet Nebulos, the Headmasters\nof the Japanese series are a group of small Cybertronians who departed the\nplanet millions of years ago and crash-landed on the inhospitable planet Master.\nTo survive its harsh climate, a select few Cybertronians constructed larger\nbodies called &quot;Transtectors&quot;, to which they connected as the heads.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3ccb04906b8b08ecedee237268e949f09ae108f","amp;dn":"Transformers.Headmasters.1987.DVDRip.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3ccb04906b8b08ecedee237268e949f09ae108f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,204,176,73,6,184,176,142,206,222,226,55,38,142,148,159,9,174,16,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
