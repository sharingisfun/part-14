He was a superstar by the age of 25; he was dead at the age of 29. In those four short years, he established the rules for all the country performers who followed him and, in the process, much of popular music. Hank wrote a body of songs that became popular classics, and his direct, emotional lyrics and vocals became the standard for most popular performers. He lived a life as troubled and reckless as that depicted in his songs. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t97.18% CDDA &amp; 88.55% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tUTV Records\nCatalog:\t\t088 170 268-2\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.I Saw The Light\n02.A Mansion On The Hill\n03.Honky Tonkin'\n04.Move It On Over\n05.You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)\n06.I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\n07.Mind Your Own Business\n08.My Bucket's Got A Hole In It\n09.Long Gone Lonesome Blues\n10.Cold, Cold Heart\n11.Howlin' At The Moon\n12.I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)\n13.Hey, Good Lookin'\n14.Ramblin' Man\n15.I Dreamed About Mama Last Night\n16.(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle\n17.Honky Tonk Blues\n18.Half As Much\n19.Jambalaya (On The Bayou)\n20.Settin' The Woods On Fire\n21.I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive\n22.You Win Again\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Your Cheatin' Heart\n02.Please Make Up Your Mind\n03.Kaw-Liga\n04.Take These Chains From My Heart\n05.Rockin' Chair Money\n06.Please Don't Let Me Love You\n07.Someday You'll Call My Name\n08.Cool Water\n09.First Year Blues\n10.Alone And Forsaken\n11.The Angel Of Death\n12.Ready To Go Home\n13.There's A Tear In My Beer\n14.Weary Blues From Waitin'\n15.Why Don't You Love Me\n16.Moanin' The Blues\n17.I'm A Long Gone Daddy\n18.Lost Highway\n19.I Can't Get You Off Of My Mind\n20.Lovesick Blues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1311d1839b4a7eccba4c6cd65eba8cb35b85e8b2","amp;dn":"Hank+Williams+-+Ultimate+Collection+%282002%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1311d1839b4a7eccba4c6cd65eba8cb35b85e8b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,17,209,131,155,74,126,204,186,76,108,214,94,186,140,179,91,133,232,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
