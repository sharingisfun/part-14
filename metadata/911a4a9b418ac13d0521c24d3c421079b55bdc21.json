The original band comprised initiator and main songwriter Chrissie Hynde (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), James Honeyman-Scott (lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), Pete Farndon (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Martin Chambers (drums, backing vocals, percussion). Following the drug-related deaths of Honeyman-Scott and Farndon, the band has experienced numerous subsequent personnel changes, with Hynde as the only consistent member, and Chambers returning after an absence of several years.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGet Close is the fourth album by rock group The Pretenders, released in 1986. The album contains the band's two biggest Mainstream Rock Tracks chart hits, &quot;Don't Get Me Wrong&quot; and &quot;My Baby&quot;, both of which reached #1.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\nChrissie Hynde: vocals, rhythm guitar\nRobbie McIntosh: guitars\nT.
