She follows it down a rabbit hole when suddenly she falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a small key to a door too small for her to fit, but through which she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle labelled &quot;DRINK ME&quot;, the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key. A cake with &quot;EAT ME&quot; on it causes her to grow to such a tremendous size her head hits the ceiling.\n\n\nAlice Through the Looking Glass\nAlice is playing with a white kitten (whom she calls &quot;Snowdrop&quot;) and a black kitten (whom she calls &quot;Kitty&quot;)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the offspring of Dinah, Alice's cat in Alice's Adventures in WonderlandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirror's reflection. Climbing up on the fireplace mantel, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she is able to step through it to an alternative world. In this reflected version of her own house, she finds a book with looking-glass poetry, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that the chess-pieces have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up.\n\n\nAdditional:\nLewis Carroll - Miscellany.\nAdventures In Russia 2002.\nFury Said to a Mouse.\nJabberwocky.\nWalrus and Carpenter (Joss Ackland).\n\nLewis Carroll - The Hunting of the Snark.\nThe Hunting of the Snark (Poetry Please).\nThe Hunting of the Snark (1992-05-04) (30.38) stars Alan Bennett.\n\n\ntorrent hash: a766d7a09e703822bca7c9c8f65a20566eb9b367 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a766d7a09e703822bca7c9c8f65a20566eb9b367","amp;dn":"Lewis+Carroll+Collection%5BAudiobooks%5D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a766d7a09e703822bca7c9c8f65a20566eb9b367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,102,215,160,158,112,56,34,188,167,201,200,246,90,32,86,110,185,179,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
