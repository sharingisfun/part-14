Case &quot;InquiringMind&quot; \n\nI've been interested in Asperger's Syndrome for more than 15 years, ever since articles about the syndrome first started to appear in popular newspapers and magazines. It was obvious to me from the very beginning that the academic world in which I worked had an unusually high number of these brilliant, but decidedly weird, personalities. I wanted to know more about these colleagues that seemed to think and act so differently from the norm. \n\nWhen autobiographies by Aspergians started to appear in publication, I snapped them up and read them eagerly. One of the very first was Temple Grandin's &quot;Thinking In Pictures.&quot; She became widely known when the famous neurologist and author, Oliver Sacks, wrote about her in his bestselling book &quot;An Anthropologist On Mars.&quot; I recommend both of these books highly. \n\nAutobiographies are great, but there is nothing like the power of fiction to get a reader deeply inside the mind of another human being! There are two outstanding works of fiction that I am familiar with that are told from the perspective of someone on the high end of the autism spectrum: &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; by Mark Haddon, and &quot;The Speed of Dark&quot; by Elizabeth Moon. I also recommend both of these books highly. \n\nA few weeks ago, I stopped to gaze on the many titles that Amazon was recommending to me, based on the titles I've purchased from them or reviewed on their site. I was delighted to see there was a new Aspergian autobiography on the market: John Elder Robison's &quot;Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's.&quot; I ordered it immediately. Yesterday, I picked up the book after breakfast and was surprised to find that I had completely finished it by later that same afternoon. \n\nWhat a delightful, and often humorous, book this was! The book is mainly a collection of stories from the Robison's unusual life. The writing is surprisingly fresh, honest, and emotionally open. The stories are full of amazingly dysfunctional parents, geeky pranks, and weird happenings. Though them, and many inward-looking passages found throughout the book, Robison gives us keen insight into the mind and thinking processes of a high-functioning person with Asperger's Syndrome, aptly named by Robison throughout this work as Aspergians. \n\nOther reviewers have covered well what is included in these stories and how Robison's life and this book relates to his younger brother's bestselling book and major motion picture &quot;Running With Scissors,&quot; so I won't cover those aspects here. \n\nWhat I do want to add that as is wholly new, is that this book is a great companion-piece to &quot;The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science&quot; by Norman Doidge. This absolutely fascinating new book gives an easily readable, enjoyable, and thought-provoking nonprofessional overview of the new science of neuroplasticity--the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections over the life span. This is what Robison was able to do--completely by himself, without professional intervention. As you read this book, you'll be able to see how Robison was able to rewire his brain, and eventually to make himself more normal. \n\nRobison, the adult accomplished 40-year-old author who writes this book, no longer possesses the same brain wiring problems that his younger self had to deal with. That is why this book can be told with such a high degree of emotional openness and understanding. Toward the end of the book, Robison talks with great understanding briefly about the new science of neuroplasticity and how he is confident that he has been able to slowly rewire his brain over the last two decades of his life. \n\nThis is what is wonderful about this book. For me, it was not so much a good book about Aspergians, but it was a fascinating tale about an Aspergian who was able to rewire his brain successfully to respond more normally to life. \n\nIf this aspect of Robison's autobiography interests you, then by all means, read &quot;The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science.&quot; There you will find numerous real-life stories about people, with a wide range of disabilities, who were able to achieve successfully what seemed--until only very recently--an impossible task: changing their brains and conquering their disabilities. Norman Doidge's neuroplasticity book gets my unqualified highest recommendation. It will change the way you look at the world and you will be able to understand, on an easy scientific level, what Robison was able to do to his Aspergian brain over the last two decades. \n\nSo, what do I feel about Robison's book in general? Well, it was easy and pleasant to read and well worth the time and effort. There are perhaps better books that take you deeper into the mind of an Aspergian. But no book out there shows you a better real-life example of the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections over the life span. I'd give it three stars for the storytelling, three stars for the writing, three stars for the insight it brings to bear on Asperger's Syndrome, but four stars on what it brings to bear on the new science of neuroplasticity, and for me, that last one out weighs all the rest. \n\nBrain That Changes Itself, The: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science\nBy M.D., Norman Doidge\n\n________________________________________\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fae973b69691c12fa7878b41a35e78bb5638788","amp;dn":"Brain+That+Changes+Itself+The%3A+Stories+of+Personal+Triumph+from","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fae973b69691c12fa7878b41a35e78bb5638788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,174,151,59,105,105,28,18,250,120,120,180,26,53,231,139,181,99,135,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
