Thus begins his life as a quiet, straight-A student by day and a self-appointed hero at night. But what is a real hero? And who decides what is right or wrong? As the boundaries blur, SeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dual life wears on his psyche and his two worlds careen dangerously close to colliding. Like a graphic novel you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t put down, Boy Wonder challenges morality, distorting perceptions of what is right and what is justified, as it races to its shocking conclusion.\n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Drama | Thriller\nIMDB rating: 6.7/10\nDirected by: Michael Morrissey\nStarring: Zulay Henao, James Russo and Tracy Middendorf\n\nRelease Name: Boy.Wonder.2010.DvDRip.XviD.Ac3.Feel-Free\nSize: 854 MiB\nVideo: XviD | 640 x 272 | 781 Kbps\nAudio: English | AC-3 | 448 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 36mn\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9e66426055b76d813f3b769b98b4e867d2108b9","amp;dn":"Boy.Wonder.2010.DvDRip.XviD.Ac3-Feel-Free","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9e66426055b76d813f3b769b98b4e867d2108b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,230,100,38,5,91,118,216,19,243,183,105,185,139,78,134,125,33,8,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
