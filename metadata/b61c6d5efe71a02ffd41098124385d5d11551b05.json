Born in Missouri, Howard moved to Portland\n where he recorded his debut, self-titled album in a basement studio. Influenced by Bert Jansch, Neil Young, \nTownes Van Zandt, and James Talley, Barna Howard echoes the same legendary sound. Barna Howard is so honest, \nsincere and charismatic itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to believe that it was released just over a week ago. It most certainly\n is one of the finest examples of true folk music IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard lately. And, while writing a review for the album, \nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m finding it hard to translate my feelings into words. I absolutely love, LOVE this album and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all I can say.\n Expressing my admiration and adoration for it would be like me trying to explain the meaning of life.\n\n\n=======================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1  Horizons Fade  4:07 \t\n2  I'll Let You Pick a Window  3:34 \t\n3  Tinker Creek  4:05 \t\n4  I Don't Fall Much, Anymore  3:44 \t\n5  Song For Joe  2:36 \t\n6  Promise, I Won't Laugh  3:15 \t\n7  It Hurts To Know  3:41 \t\n8  Pat's House  2:19 \t\n9  Turns Around the Bottle  2:51 \t\n10  Timber, Nails and Tears  3:09 \n\n=========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 80.4 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Barna Howard\nTrack name/Total                         : 10\nPerformer                                : Barna Howard\nRecorded date                            : 2012\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpg\n\n========================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b61c6d5efe71a02ffd41098124385d5d11551b05","amp;dn":"Barna+Howard+-+Barna+Howard+%282012%29+-+Mp3+%5B320cbr%5D+-+ausy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b61c6d5efe71a02ffd41098124385d5d11551b05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,28,109,94,254,113,160,47,253,65,9,129,36,56,93,93,17,85,27,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
