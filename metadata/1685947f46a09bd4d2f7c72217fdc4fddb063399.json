On the day Katniss and Peeta are set to begin a victory tour of the country, President Coriolanus Snow visits her. He explains that her approach to ending the last Hunger Games, where she and Peeta attempted a suicide pact after learning they could not both survive, inspired rebellions in the districts; he orders that Katniss not only convince the entire country of her and Peeta's love as the reason for their actions, but convince Snow himself.\n\nThe first stop of the tour is in District 11, former home of Rue, Katniss' 12-year-old ally who was killed in the previous games. After Katniss and Peeta voice their personal thoughts regarding both the districts' fallen tributes, a man in the crowd whistles the tune Katniss and Rue shared to ensure each another of their safety, and provides the three-finger salute of District 12. Everyone follows the man's example until a Peacekeeper shoots the man dead, leaving Katniss angry, afraid, and upset. Their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, informs Katniss and Peeta that they must display their relationship for the remainder of their lives. Katniss proposes a public engagement between herself and Peeta, which is carried out and celebrated at Snow's home in the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1685947f46a09bd4d2f7c72217fdc4fddb063399","amp;dn":"The+Hunger+Games+-+Catching+Fire+CamRip.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1685947f46a09bd4d2f7c72217fdc4fddb063399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,133,148,127,70,160,155,212,210,247,199,34,23,253,196,253,219,6,51,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
