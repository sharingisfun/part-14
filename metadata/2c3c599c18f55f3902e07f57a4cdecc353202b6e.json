Greatest Hits rectifies that problem by collecting all of his best-known     \n          tracks, from &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; to &quot;Crossfire.&quot; Not only is it a terrific introduction, \n          it's his most consistent album, demonstrating exactly why he was one of the most     \n          important guitarists of the '80s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide         \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Taxman                      [03:34]                                        \n                 02.Texas flood                 [05:22]                                        \n                 03.The house is rockin'        [02:24]                                        \n                 04.Pride and joy               [03:40]                                        \n                 05.Tightrope                   [04:39]                                        \n                 06.Little wing                 [06:49]                                        \n                 07.Crossfire                   [04:10]                                        \n                 08.Change it                   [03:59]                                        \n                 09.Cold shot                   [04:01]                                        \n                 10.Couldn't stand the weather  [04:42]                                        \n                 11.Life without you            [04:17]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               47:37 min                                       \n                                                71,7 MB                                        \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c3c599c18f55f3902e07f57a4cdecc353202b6e","amp;dn":"Stevie_Ray_Vaughn_And_Double_Trouble-Greatest_Hits-%28Retail%29-1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c3c599c18f55f3902e07f57a4cdecc353202b6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,60,89,156,24,245,95,57,2,224,127,87,164,205,236,195,83,32,43,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
