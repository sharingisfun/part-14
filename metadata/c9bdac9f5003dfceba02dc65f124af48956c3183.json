Super sorry for the late upload; life kind of got in the way. Here's a Marvel NOW! torrent. At this point, all the series are fully into the All-New Marvel NOW! era.\nIncluded are:\n\nAvengers A.I. 010\nCaptain America 018\nIron Man 022\nLoki Agent of Asgard 002\nMagneto 001\nMoon Knight 001\nNew Warriors 002\nNova 014\nThe Punisher 003\nShe-Hulk 002\nUncanny X-Men 018\nWolverine and the X-Men 001\n\n\nIf you like them and have the money, BUY THEM and support your favorite creators, writers, artists, local comic shops and publishers. \n\nSeriously, buy the comics you have money for. But only the ones you think deserve your money-- vote with your dollars, and also make your voices heard. Marvel has a pretty good internet presence, which also means they read emails, tweets, tumblr responses, facebook comments. They've shown that they are solely focused on sales numbers-- vote with yr money, and tell them with words (not curses). They WILL listen, eventually. You know-- the internets.\n\nAll my thanks to all the uploaders and scanners and seeders out there! Enjoy! (and seed!)\n\nPersonal commentary of the week:  so... okay. &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men 001&quot;. AND! All-new Moon Knight! Sweet. Written by one of my favorite writers ever, Warren Ellis, and drawn by the awesome Declan Shalvey?! Super sweet!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9bdac9f5003dfceba02dc65f124af48956c3183","amp;dn":"Marvel+NOW%21+Week+68+All-New+Week+11+05%2F03%2F2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9bdac9f5003dfceba02dc65f124af48956c3183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,189,172,159,80,3,223,206,186,2,220,101,241,36,175,72,149,108,49,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
