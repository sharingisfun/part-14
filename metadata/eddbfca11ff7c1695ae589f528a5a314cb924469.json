It will be the first album since the original Sublime disbanded in 1996, due to lead singer and guitarist Bradley Nowell dying from a drug overdose. After the break up, its surviving members Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh reformed Sublime in 2009 almost by accident, with Rome Ramirez filling in for Nowell. However, the group were unable to use the name Sublime for legal reasons, which resulted in the birth of Sublime with Rome. After embarking on their first US tour in 2010, Sublime with Rome signed with the independent record label Fueled by Ramen and went to work on its first full-length studio album. Guitarist Paul Leary of Butthole \nSurfers, who co-produced Sublime\\\\\\'s eponymous final album, produced it.\n\n\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Panic\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ 2:23\n\\\\\\&quot;Only\\\\\\&quot; - 2:40\n\\\\\\&quot;Lovers Rock\\\\\\&quot; - 3:25\n\\\\\\&quot;Murdera\\\\\\&quot; - 4:26\n\\\\\\&quot;My World\\\\\\&quot; - 2:29\n\\\\\\&quot;Paper Cuts\\\\\\&quot; - 1:53\n\\\\\\&quot;PCH\\\\\\&quot; - 3:23\n\\\\\\&quot;Same Old Situation\\\\\\&quot; - 3:44\n\\\\\\&quot;Take it or Leave It\\\\\\&quot; - 3:52\n\\\\\\&quot;You Better Listen\\\\\\&quot; - 3:20\n\\\\\\&quot;Spun\\\\\\&quot; - 3:27\n\\\\\\&quot;Can You Feel It\\\\\\&quot; (feat.
