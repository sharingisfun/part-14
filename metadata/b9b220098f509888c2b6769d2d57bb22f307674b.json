The game first appeared only in Japan on Nintendo's Super Famicom (known internationally as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System). It has been ported with minor differences to Sony's PlayStation and the Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. An original video animation produced in 1994 called Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals serves as a sequel to the events depicted in the game. \n\nThe game begins as a wanderer named Bartz investigates a fallen meteor. There, he encounters several characters, one of whom reveals the danger facing the four Crystals that control the world's elements. These Crystals act as a seal on Exdeath, an evil sorcerer who once threatened their world. Bartz and his party must keep the Crystals from being exploited by Exdeath's influence and prevent his resurgence. \n\nFinal Fantasy V has been praised for the freedom of customization that the player has over the characters, achieved through the greatly expanded Job System. Despite the lack of an early release in territories other than Japan, the Super Famicom version sold more than two million copies.[2] The PlayStation version has earned &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; status, selling more than 350,000 copies. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Fantasy V \nDeveloper: SquareSoft \nGenre: Role-Playing \nRelease Date: 03/19/98 \nISO Size: 304 mb \n\nWill not run on firmware prior to 3.03 CE-C.
