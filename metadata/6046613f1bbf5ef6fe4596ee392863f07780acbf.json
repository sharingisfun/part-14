The material covered is quite broad in that it describes both the secondary plant products such as pigments, alkaloids, and terpenoids which are dear to the organic chemist's heart and the primary products such as the lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins which are more frequently dealt with in biochemistry. The organization is along biogenetic lines: first, the acetogenins, then the nitrogeneous compounds followed by carbohydrates and isoprenoids. The book would appear to be unique. The only similar texts available are the laboratory manuals used in pharmacognosy.  \n\nEach section of the book is preceded by a brief and concise description of the general chemistry of the type of compounds being considered. \nThese are especially well done and, taken together, provide an excellent introduction to natural product chemistry.   \n\nReviewed by James M. Bobbitt University of Connecticut Storrs, Connecticut","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6046613f1bbf5ef6fe4596ee392863f07780acbf","amp;dn":"Natural+Products%2C+A+Laboratory+Guide%2C+Raphael+Ikan%2C+2nd+edition.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6046613f1bbf5ef6fe4596ee392863f07780acbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,70,97,63,27,191,94,246,254,69,150,238,57,40,99,240,119,128,172,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
