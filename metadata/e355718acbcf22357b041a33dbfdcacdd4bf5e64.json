The authors do not mean to imply that the foreign policy views of the CFR are shared by all 1400 of its members.\nUnfortunately, there have been instances when, for example, a busy industrialist will join an organization or permit his name to be used without first fully investigating the aims and purposes of such an organization.\nPerhaps after reading the documented material contained in this book some members of the Council on Foreign Relations, who do not agree with the national-sovereignty-destroying aims of the CFR may wish to conduct their own investigation.\n\nAbout the author:\nKent and Phoebe Courtney, a husband-and-wife team, are publisher and editor, respectively, of THE INDEPENDENT AMERICAN, a national Conservative Political Action Newspaper, which they founded in January, 1955. THE INDEPENDENT AMERICAN Newspaper has subscribers in all 50 States.\nOther activities of Kent and Phoebe Courtney include the publishing of TAX FAX pamphlets advocating the Conservative position on such national issues as Foreign Aid, Federal Aid to Education, Socialized Medicine, Federal Urban Renewal, etc. More, than 3,000,000 copies of these TAX FAX pamphlets have been published and distributed during the past five years.\nThe CourtneysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ first book THE CASE OF GENERAL EDWIN A. WALKER Ã¢â‚¬â€ How the Appeasers Propose to Substitute Surrender for Victory, was published in August, 1961.\nThe second book by Kent and Phoebe Courtney, THE CSA VOTING INDEX, which contained a tabulation and analysis of the key votes in the 1961 Session of Congress, was published in early 1962.\nKent Courtney is the commentator of The Radio Edition of Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the Independent American, a weekly broadcast of Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Conservative side of the news,*Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ which is heard over an ever-increasing number of stations from coast to coast.\nCourtney, born in Minnesota, moved to New Orleans in 1929. He is a graduate of the School of Business Administration of TulanÃƒÂª University in New Orleans, having majored in economics and later serving as an instructor in economics in TulaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s University College.
