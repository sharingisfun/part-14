He had brilliant technique, a very wide range, his own sound, a witty and swinging style, and gave the impression that he could play anything. Over five CDs, the Lone Hill label has reissued most of Shavers' recordings as a leader from 1954-1964, just skipping an album for Capitol, live sets put out by Hep and Spotlight, a Storyville date and two albums released by Vogue. Complete Recordings, Vol. 1 is a perfect place to start, because this CD reissues a set of French-associated songs (from the album Charlie Digs Paree), an exciting and successful program of Dixieland tunes (from Charlie Digs Dixie) and four numbers from the trumpeter's At Le Crazy Horse Saloon, an album whose contents are split between three CDs in this series. Shavers is heard throughout as the only horn in a quartet, with pianist Ray Bryant on all but the Crazy Horse selections. Sometimes the rhythm section provides a shuffle rhythm (ÃƒÂ  la Jonah Jones) while at other times they swing conventionally. It is particularly fun to hear the trumpeter tear into the Dixieland repertoire. Shavers is the star throughout and was at the peak of his remarkable powers during this period. It is a pity that he is largely forgotten today, for he was a truly remarkable player. (AllMusic)\nVol. 2\nMost of Charlie Shavers' recordings from the 1954-1964 period have been reissued on five single CDs by the Lone Hill Jazz label. The virtuoso trumpeter was at the peak of his powers during this period but his recordings were made for small labels and he was greatly overshadowed by quite a few other brassmen. Complete Recordings, Vol. 2 has the complete contents of the LPs Memorial and Here Comes Charlie, plus three numbers from his Charlie Shavers at Le Crazy Horse Saloon album. The focus is almost entirely on Shavers' horn, for he is in the spotlight throughout while backed by pianist Ray Bryant (who is very much in a supportive role), bassist Aaron Bell, and drummer Roy Burns. Shavers takes quite a few spectacular solos and, although the performances are mostly very concise (nearly all of the selections are under three-minutes long), the trumpeter makes every note count during the consistently exciting program. (AllMusic)\nVol. 3\nCharlie Shavers, one of the greatest if most underrated trumpeters of all time, was in his late prime during the period covered by Complete Recordings, Vol. 3 and four other volumes of Lone Hill Jazz reissues. Shavers' extroverted sound, brilliant technique, wide range and fertile wit always made his solos a delight. This CD reissues all of the music from his LPs Like Charlie and Excitement Unlimited plus five cuts from Charlie Shavers at Le Crazy Horse Saloon. The Like Charlie album has Shavers joined by a rhythm section with pianist Ray Bryant, and includes spectacular versions of &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free,&quot; &quot;A Little Spanish Town,&quot; &quot;Carioca,&quot; and other swing standards. The Crazy Horse numbers have Shavers with an unidentified trio while the Excitement Unlimited sessions showcase the trumpeter in an octet with tenor-saxophonist Budd Johnson and altoist Jerome Richardson. Although the first two volumes in this series are a bit more essential, this generous CD is also a must for Charlie Shavers collectors. (AllMusic)\n\nEnjoy and share!
