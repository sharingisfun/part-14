Told in a sentimental tone, Burns weaves a lyrical tale of the great metropolis that encompasses not only the city&amp;#039;s streets, but also that of the history of America. Though around fourteen hours in length, this epic documentary presents a thoughtful, entertaining look at our relatively young country.\n\nI have a very slow connection so please share and if you can upload it to file storing servers that&amp;#039;s even better.
