Blues Bureau International is a guitar oriented, blues, blues guitar and blues rock record label from Novato, California. Blues Bureau is a member of Mike Varney's Shrapnel Label Group, which also includes Shrapnel Records, another guitar oriented label which features shred guitar, hard rock, metal and progressive metal, and Tone Center Records, a jazz oriented label featuring fusion guitar as well as a number of jazz tributes. Blues Bureau artists include Rick Derringer, Eric Gales, Marc Ford, Stoney Curtis, Jon Butcher, Chris Duarte, Leslie West and Pat Travers. The Blues Bureau catalog is a reflection of Mr. Varney's desire to provide a platform for talented young blues guitarists, and to allow established artists to pursue their artistic vision.\n\n...... Blues Bureau's Rowdy Roadhouse Blues is a rambunctious collection of barroom blues rockers that would be the ideal film soundtrack for one of those scenes in an out of the way roadside joint where Chairs are broken and asses are kicked.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4db419032ff0c93a208e0747ac5254164bff26e1","amp;dn":"%28Blues-VA%29+Rowdy+Roadhouse+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4db419032ff0c93a208e0747ac5254164bff26e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,180,25,3,47,240,201,58,32,142,7,71,172,82,84,22,75,255,38,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
