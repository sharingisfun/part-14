Brooks assumed the Chris Gaines personality in 1999, recording one album under the name and charting three singles on the Billboard charts, including the Top 5 pop hit &quot;Lost in You.&quot;\n\n\nIn 1999 Brooks and his production company Red Strokes Entertainment, with Paramount Pictures, began to develop a movie in which Brooks would star. The Lamb was to have revolved around Chris Gaines, a fictional rock singer and his emotionally conflicted life as a musician in the public eye. To create buzz for the project, Brooks took on the identity of Gaines in the October 1999 album Garth Brooks in ... The Life of Chris Gaines, which was intended as a 'pre-soundtrack' to the film. Brooks also subsequently appeared as Gaines in a television &quot;mockumentary&quot; for the VH1 series Behind The Music and as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live, which he hosted as himself.\n\nBrooks' endless promotion of the album and the film did not seem to stir much excitement and the lack of success of the Chris Gaines experiment became fairly evident mere weeks after the album was released. Although critics admired Brooks for taking a musical risk, the majority of the American public was either totally bewildered, or completely unreceptive to the idea of Garth Brooks as anything but a pop-country singer. Many of his fans also felt that, by supporting the Gaines project, they would lose the real Garth Brooks. Sales of the album were unspectacular and although it made it to #2 on the pop album chart, expectations had been higher and retail stores began heavily discounting their oversupply. Less than expected sales of the album (more than two million) and no further developments in the production of the film as a result brought the project to an indefinite hiatus in February 2001 and Gaines quickly faded into obscurity.\n\nDespite the less than spectacular response to the Chris Gaines project, Brooks gained his first - and only - US Top 40 pop single in &quot;Lost in You&quot;, the first single from the album.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Life of Chris Gaines 1999\n\n\nGreatest Hits, also titled Garth Brooks in.... The Life of Chris Gaines, is part of the alter ego project of American country music artist Garth Brooks, in which Brooks assumes the fictitious persona of alternative rock artist Chris Gaines. Originally, this album was intended to be the soundtrack for a movie called The Lamb that would star Brooks as a rock star recalling the different periods of his life. This album was purposely released a year in advance from the scheduled film release date to pique interest in Brooks performing rock instead of country. The Lamb, however, was never filmed due to financial and management problems.\n\nThis is Brooks' eleventh overall album, released on September 28, 1999. It reached #2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and also gained Brook's first and, to date, only appearance on the U.S. Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, with &quot;Lost in You&quot;, which peaked at #5.\n\nOn November 13, 1999, Brooks hosted Saturday Night Live as himself but performed the musical numbers as Chris Gaines without acknowledging to the audience that they were the same person. He performed &quot;Way of the Girl.&quot;\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;That's The Way I Remember It&quot; (Tommy Sims, Tony Arata) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n2.\t&quot;Lost in You&quot; (Gordon Kennedy, Wayne Kirkpatrick, Sims) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n3.\t&quot;Snow in July&quot; (Kennedy, Kirkpatrick, Mike More, Andrew Logan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n4.\t&quot;Driftin' Away&quot; (Sims) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n5.\t&quot;Way of the Girl&quot; (Kennedy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n6.\t&quot;Unsigned Letter&quot; (Kennedy, Kirkpatrick, Sims) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n7.\t&quot;It Don't Matter to the Sun&quot; (Kennedy, Kirkpatrick, Sims) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n8.\t&quot;Right Now&quot; (Cheryl Wheeler, Chet Powers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n9.\t&quot;Main Street&quot; (Kennedy, Kirkpatrick, Trisha Yearwood) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n10.\t&quot;White Flag&quot; (Kennedy, Kirkpatrick) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n11.\t&quot;Digging for Gold&quot; (Kennedy, Kirkpatrick) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n12.\t&quot;Maybe&quot; (Kennedy, Phil Madeira) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11\n13.\t&quot;My Love Tells Me So&quot; (Kennedy, Kirkpatrick, Sims) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:139ea098722e7e6c3cc836a138f7f58897660990","amp;dn":"Garth+Brooks+-+In+The+Life+of+Chris+Gaines+1999+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"139ea098722e7e6c3cc836a138f7f58897660990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,158,160,152,114,46,126,108,60,200,54,161,56,247,245,136,151,102,9,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
