And you know what? It sounds fantastic. Proving that, in this age of digital wonders, a song as instantly appealling as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKatieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will cut through all the studio trickery. Because good songwriting is something that no amount of computer aids can create and Eaglesmith is the real thing. Moaning the words to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJohnny CashÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ over Matty SimpsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ragged Neil Young-ish guitar about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhis songs give you a real good feelingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and so on to all of those latecomers to the late singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s art once the American Recordings series arrived. Sadly, Eaglesmith noting that the radio stationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing his hero now when they never did when he was alive could be being prophetic. He is one of CanadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest and isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t getting the respect he deserves.\n\ncd ripped by  EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/10/30/fred-eaglesmith/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70574cdda6759c93de22f1a3b8bad651b1b63f9f","amp;dn":"Fred+Eaglesmith...6+Volts%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70574cdda6759c93de22f1a3b8bad651b1b63f9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,87,76,221,166,117,156,147,222,34,241,163,184,186,214,81,177,182,63,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
