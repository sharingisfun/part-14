But now is everything allright..\n\n\n******************** Mafia II ******************\n\nis upon us and ushering in a new era of wise guys and made men. If you've been waiting for this one, there is good news GGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼GÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ the game is\n fun. Having shootouts in bars while bottles explode and glass flies, finding a mob hacking your friend to death, and going to brothels are all\n great times. Still, those moments aren't the entire game, and the accompanying parts hurt the whole.\n\nMafia II casts you as Vito Scaletta, a young Italian who returns from World War II to find his mother and sister on the hook to a loan shark. \nLike any gangster in a gangster movie, Vito decides he doesn't want a subpar life of the slums and goes down the organized crime route to make \nsome cash. You'll be with Vito as he whacks dudes, steals cars and tries on all sorts of snazzy outfits.\nThis is a video review you can't refuse.\n\nAll of this is going on in Empire Bay, a New York-esque town packed with people, cops, cars and collectable Playboy magazines. Now, at first \nglance, Empire Bay looks like an open world GGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼GÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ one teeming with missions and quests for you to take Vito on. It isn't. You'll have one mission \nat any time and it's always one that drives the story forward. All the icons on the map GGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼GÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ clothing stores, gun stores, and so on GGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼GÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ are just \nways to enhance that mission. Outgunned and dying a lot? Buy better weapons after restarting. Cops on your tail? Go pay to have the license \nplate changed on your ride. You're not going to wander around the streets of Mafia II picking up odd jobs and meeting strangers; this is a \nworld built around the missions you're doing.\n\n************************************************\nSo what is so good with this upload?\n\nImproved Mafia 2 performance with the APEX clothes fix Some of you with even mid-high range video hardware might find slowness, stuttering and other framerate related issues while playing Mafia 2.\n\n***Thankfully, all this allready fix and done by me!!***\n\nYou get a massive framerate boost without losing too much visual quality. The game uses \ndynamic clothing (realistic clothing simulation) not only for the main character but for all NPCs as well. This is a very CPU and GPU intensive\n task and can take up quite a lot of resources. \nthis should greatly improve frame rate.\n\n************************************************\n                  Install Info!\n\nJust copy folder content to program files dir and run launcher play..\n************************************************\n\n**************ENJOY THE GAME :)))***************\n\nBy Chevy87swe\n\nDont forget seeeeeeeed.............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f28dc0b237d4fb4ba67656a655264a0823eda630","amp;dn":"Mafia+II+%2B+Jimmys+Vendetta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f28dc0b237d4fb4ba67656a655264a0823eda630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,141,192,178,55,212,251,75,166,118,86,166,85,38,74,8,35,237,166,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
