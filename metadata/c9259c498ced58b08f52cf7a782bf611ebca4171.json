All I do for my formatting is remove the section breaks - all spelling and grammatical errors remain as they were, as do paragraph errors.\nI do however change the properties so the books will come up with Title and Author in eReader.\n\nAll of these books are available in the more mainstram formats (html, pdf, lit, doc). Search and you will find!\n\nAll files are virus scanned and are clean.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9259c498ced58b08f52cf7a782bf611ebca4171","amp;dn":"Nora+Roberts+Collection+-+eReader+Format+%5BEbonyGold%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9259c498ced58b08f52cf7a782bf611ebca4171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,37,156,73,140,237,88,176,143,82,207,122,120,43,246,17,235,202,65,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
