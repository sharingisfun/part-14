Using scenarios which mimic daily life, the cases will interest students in clinical problems and help them develop their clinical reasoning skills, with each case presenting details of a patient's medical history and the key findings of a clinical examination, together with initial investigation results for evaluation. Key questions then prompt the student to evaluate the patient, and reach a decision regarding their condition and the possible management plan, while the answer pages will help the student to understand the processes that a clinician goes through in dealing with the problems presented. Contents are organised to provide a quick review of each body system, with a selection of cases relevant to that specific system, then the majority are presented randomly to mimic real life in a GP surgery or emergency department. New to this edition: a review of each body system as well as random cases  new page design with a second colour used throughout  and brought up-to-date with 25% new cases.\n\nAbout the Authors\nP John Rees, Consultant Physician and Professor of Medical Education, King's College London School of Medicine at Guy's, King's and St Thomas' Hospitals, London, UK\nJames Pattison, Consultant Nephrologist, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK\nGwyn Williams, Emeritus Professor of Medicine, King's College London School of Medicine at Guy's, King's and St Thomas' Hospitals, London, UK \nSeries Editor: P John Rees MD FRCP\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface vii\nAcknowledgements ix\nAbbreviations xi\nSection 1: Systems-related cases 1\nCardiology 3\nRespiratory 9\nAbdomen 14\nLiver 19\nRenal 23\nEndocrinology 27\nNeurology 33\nRheumatology 37\nHaematology 43\nInfection 47\nSection 2: General self-assessment cases 53\nIndex 257","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69d50632365ce26883803bdb29d7a5d81c06ba12","amp;dn":"100+Cases+in+Clinical+Medicine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69d50632365ce26883803bdb29d7a5d81c06ba12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,213,6,50,54,92,226,104,131,128,59,219,41,215,165,216,28,6,186,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
