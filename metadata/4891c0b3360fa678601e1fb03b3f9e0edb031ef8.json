I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from a user named &quot;b2pilot187&quot;. Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be setled sooner rather than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won't even read this, because he simply searches for &quot;911&quot; and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***\n\nReVIsed alias Masterpiece\n\nSynopsis:\n\nGeorge Humphrey provides objective and factual information while asking relevant questions concerning events which took place on September 11.
