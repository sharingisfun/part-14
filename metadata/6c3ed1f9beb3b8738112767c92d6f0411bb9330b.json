It was \nreleased on 13 March 1989, and peaked at no. 3 in the UK. Within three \nweeks of release, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic \nIndustry for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. The album's first single &quot;I \nDon't Want a Lover&quot; was released in January 1989 and peaked at no. 8 in the \nUK. Following the release of the album in March, which entered the UK Album \nChart at no.3, further singles from the album were less successful. The \nsecond single, &quot;Thrill Has Gone&quot;, peaked at no. 60, while a third single, \n&quot;Everyday Now&quot;, fared little better at no. 44. Despite this, a fourth single, \n&quot;Prayer for You&quot;, was released in November but stalled at no. 73 in the UK. \nDespite only one hit single, the album spent 29 weeks on the charts. The \nalbum cover art was derived from the poster art for the film Paris, Texas, \nwhich inspired the band name","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c3ed1f9beb3b8738112767c92d6f0411bb9330b","amp;dn":"Texas+-+Southside+%281989%29+FLAC+Soup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c3ed1f9beb3b8738112767c92d6f0411bb9330b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,62,209,249,190,179,184,115,129,18,118,124,146,214,240,65,27,185,51,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
