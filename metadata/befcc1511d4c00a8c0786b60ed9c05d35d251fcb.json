The work premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on January 14, 1900. It is one of the world's most popular operas, a hit with audiences from its first performance. However it was not well received at first by critics. Today, Tosca is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire and appears as number eight on Opera America's 2008 list of the 20 most-performed operas in North America.\n\n\n\nAngela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna, Ruggero Raimondi and the Chorus and Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Convent Garden, under Antonio Pappano\n\nSung in Italian with English subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:befcc1511d4c00a8c0786b60ed9c05d35d251fcb","amp;dn":"Puccini+-+Tosca+-+Gheorghiu%2C+Alagna%2C+Raimondi%2C+Pappano+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"befcc1511d4c00a8c0786b60ed9c05d35d251fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,252,193,81,29,76,0,168,192,120,107,96,237,156,5,211,93,37,31,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
