It was released after the break-up of the band in 1989 and the suicide of lead singer Dave Rubinstein in 1993. \r\nThe record is a compilation of the band's two studio albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2.\r\n\r\nReagan Youth (not to be mistaken with L.A.'s Wasted Youth) were one of the finest hardcore punk bands to ever hail from NYC. The band formed in 1980 and disbanded with Reagan's exit from office; their story is a sad and tragic one, probably the most tragic in punk rock. But that's another story...on to the record.\r\n\r\nThis is a posthumous compilation of Reagan Youth's greatest material, the first half being from their earlier, more hardcore-oriented releases and the final half being from their later, more metallic releases. There are 22 tracks in all, including the classics &quot;Jesus Was A Communist,&quot; &quot;USA,&quot; and of course, &quot;Reagan Youth.&quot; Just looking at the cover of this album pretty much explains the lyrical content, that being anti-racism/facism and other similar, refreshing themes. My personal favorite tracks would have to be &quot;One Holy Bible&quot; or &quot;Queen Of Babylon,&quot; both from the band's slightly more metallic years.\r\n\r\nIf you've never had a chance to pick up a record by Reagan Youth, this is the one to get, as it's a good taste of their entire catalog. This album is, obviously, essential listening for any fan of punk rock. Their vocalist, Dave Insurgent, has a distinct and tuneful voice that is rare in this kind of music, and the band members themselves are easily some of the most talented and skilled musicians in punk rock. \r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Reagan Youth&quot;   \t1:16\r\n2. \t&quot;New Aryans&quot;   \t1:17\r\n3. \t&quot;(Are You) Happy?&quot;   \t1:33\r\n4. \t&quot;No Class&quot;   \t1:34\r\n5. \t&quot;I Hate Hate&quot;   \t2:00\r\n6. \t&quot;Degenerated&quot;   \t2:22\r\n7. \t&quot;Go Nowhere&quot;   \t1:22\r\n8. \t&quot;USA&quot;   \t1:23\r\n9. \t&quot;Anytown&quot;   \t2:00\r\n10. \t&quot;In Dog We Trust&quot;   \t2:50\r\n11. \t&quot;It's A Beautiful Day&quot;   \t3:53\r\n12. \t&quot;Jesus Was A Communist&quot;   \t1:44\r\n13. \t&quot;Urban Savages&quot;   \t1:23\r\n14. \t&quot;What Will The Neighbors Think?&quot;   \t3:50\r\n15. \t&quot;Get The Ruler Out&quot;   \t2:25\r\n16. \t&quot;Brave New World&quot;   \t4:30\r\n17. \t&quot;Miss Teen America&quot;   \t2:46\r\n18. \t&quot;Heavy Metal Shuffle&quot;   \t4:38\r\n19. \t&quot;Queen Babylon&quot;   \t5:12\r\n20. \t&quot;Acid Rain&quot;   \t1:55\r\n21. \t&quot;One Holy Bible&quot;   \t6:33\r\n22. \t&quot;Back to the Garden (Parts I-IV)&quot;   \t4:05\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\n    Dave Rubinstein â€“ vocals (all tracks)\r\n    Paul Bakija â€“ guitar (all tracks); bass (tracks 11â€“22)\r\n    Al Pike â€“ bass (tracks 1â€“10)\r\n    Steve Weinstein â€“ drums (tracks 1â€“10)\r\n    Javier Madriaga â€“ drums (tracks 11â€“22)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2e34870dec813d2dbe60f5777f09f1a664347ff","amp;dn":"Reagan+Youth+-+A+Collection+Of+Pop+Classics++VO+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2e34870dec813d2dbe60f5777f09f1a664347ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,227,72,112,222,200,19,210,219,230,15,87,119,240,159,26,102,67,71,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
