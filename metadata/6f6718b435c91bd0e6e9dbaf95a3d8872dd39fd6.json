Captured over a period of three years, the film documents the twins and their parents, examining the Farley's struggle to redefine their family.\n\nThe twins' early lives were quintessentially all-American: picture-perfect holidays, supportive parents who cheered them on every step of the way. By the time they were 14, their parents had divorced, they had come out as gay, and a joint suicide attempt precipitated a forced separation of Mark and Alex for two and half years.\n\nThrough candid and extensive interviews with the twins and their family, Red without Blue recounts these troubled times, interweaving the twins' difficult past with their efforts to find themselves in the present. The film follows the painful steps of Clair's transition, including electrolysis and the difficult decision to proceed with bottom surgery.\n\nThrough its portrayal of these articulate and independent twins, each haunted by the painful experiences of their adolescence, the film questions normative standards of gender and identity as Mark and Clair reassert their indescribable bond as identical twins.\n\nThrough the power of the Farleys' voices, we hear the story of a family's redemption from a dark past, and ultimately, its revival to the present.\n\nMovie site: http://redwithoutblue.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6718b435c91bd0e6e9dbaf95a3d8872dd39fd6","amp;dn":"Red+without+Blue+%28Transsexual+%2F+Transgender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6718b435c91bd0e6e9dbaf95a3d8872dd39fd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,103,24,180,53,201,27,208,230,233,219,175,149,163,216,135,45,211,159,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
