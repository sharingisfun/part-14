It also provides the mathematical tools for studying the dynamics of these systems. Boccara takes a carefully inductive approach in defining what it means for a system to be &quot;complex&quot; (and at the same time addresses the equally elusive concept of emergent properties). This is the first text on the subject to draw comprehensive conclusions from such a wide range of analogous phenomena.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f540e8ab86e4c5dd7490f363ad75c0420e783a3","amp;dn":"Modeling+Complex+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f540e8ab86e4c5dd7490f363ad75c0420e783a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,84,14,138,184,110,76,93,215,73,15,54,58,215,92,4,32,231,131,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
