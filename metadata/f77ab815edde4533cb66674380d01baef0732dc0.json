(2005)\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\n\nTagline: Sex, Drugs, and Matzoh Ball Soup \n\nPlot Outline: A family&amp;#039;s Passover gets screwy after the patriarch unknowingly ingests a hit of Ecstasy.\n\n\nUser Comments: I personaly enjoyed this film :)\n\n\nCast overview, first billed only:\n\n\tMichael Lerner\t.... \tIra Stuckman\n\n\tLesley Ann Warren\t.... \tPeggy Stuckman\n\n\tJack Klugman\t.... \tArtur\n\n\tMeredith Scott Lynn\t.... \tJennifer\n\n\tShiri Appleby\t.... \tNikki\n\n\tMili Avital\t.... \tVanessa\n\tBen Feldman\t.... \tZeke\n\n\tAdam Lamberg\t.... \tLionel\n\n\tMax Greenfield\t.... \tEthan\n\tCynda Williams\t.... \tGrace\n\tMark Ivanir\t.... \tRafi\n\n\tDan Bucatinsky\t.... \tHigh Strung Client\n\tOscar Nunez\t.... \tSanta Designer\n\tVickilyn Reynolds\t.... \tTalk Show Host\n\n\tVictoria Justice\t.... \tYoung Nikki\n\n\nMPAA: Rated R for drug use, language and some sexual content.\nRuntime: USA:86 min\nCountry: USA \n\n\n\n\nIMDB User Comments:\n\nThis is A Terrific Jewish Flick!,\n9/10\nAuthor: magicpaul-2 from Minneapolis United States\n\nAlong with Adam Goldberg&amp;#039;s Shaft-parody, &quot;The Hebrew Hammer,&quot; the marvelous indie &quot;When Do We Eat&quot; is one of the two finest contemporary comedies with Jewish themes -- a far cry from the traditional Jewish cinema pantheon of &quot;Fiddler,&quot; &quot;Crossing Delancy,&quot; &quot;Yentl&quot; and &quot;The Chosen.&quot; Uproariously funny, sexy and occasionally profane, yes -- but it&amp;#039;s also deeply affectionate as &quot;When Do We Eat&quot; pokes fun at the righteousness of the orthodox, Passover traditions, and maddening family members from stoners to sex workers and Moshe Dayan look-a-likes. The script is sharp, the acting terrific (&quot;Quincy&quot; alum Jack Klugman is a riot as the Holocaust-surviving grandfather), and the hallucinogenic production values - inspired by legendary Hagadah books - is brilliant. An antidote to anyone who laments the laundering of authentic Jewish content from ostensibly Jewish TV sit-coms and films.
