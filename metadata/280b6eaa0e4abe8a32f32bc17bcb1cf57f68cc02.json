Everybody knows that Rob Lowe is very handsome, and that he spent a long time being a Hollywood wild child. Now in his 40s, LoweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reflections on his life thus far demonstrate a remarkably responsible perspective and a refreshingly self-deprecating look at how he ended up in the better state of mind he inhabits today. While the headlines and high notes may come and go, Lowe remains a devoted husband and proud father.\nThis listen is a small miracle for many reasons. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not simply the fact that Lowe reveals himself as capable of compelling writing, which he certainly does. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also not merely the path of the narrative thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intriguing, though thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely the case. Whether he is spending several chapters thoroughly reminiscing about the many lessons he learned during The Outsiders or sharing a quick anecdote about trying to meet Liza Minnelli when he was a little kid, Lowe indeed offers up a terrific set of insights about both life and stardom. He proves himself as a generous spirit, with strong thanks for Martin Sheen and solid praise for Patrick Swayze.\nHis narration is clearly heartfelt, and never comes across as phony or acted. This listen feels like a casual dinner conversation, minus the slick descent into rumor-mongering that usually rears its ugly head in memoirs of this variety. Lowe manages to steer clear of the blame game when analyzing the simultaneous blessing and curse of the Brat Pack label or his decision to leave The West Wing, and even finds some gracious adjectives for Tom Cruise. Be on the lookout for eerily spot-on impersonations of many stars, including a particularly good Christopher Walken and Matt Dillon.\nIn the end, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to put a finger on what makes this book so utterly fascinating. There isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t anything shocking in the subject matter; there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t any mud-flinging in the tone; there is very little that stands out as an exclamation point. Yet the total package undeniably and irresistibly triumphs at being genuinely charming. This is ironic, because the book then actually sort of mirrors LoweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spent the last two decades trying to upend the idea that he is simply a pretty face. The book succeeds in that endeavor, just as his several iconic film roles have done, and yet the shallow type-casting of Rob Lowe somehow too frequently persists. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true that he is a very dreamy guy, but this memoir absolutely proves that he is also intelligent, worldly, witty, and political. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an excellent listen that ought to once and for all put an end to the notion the Rob LoweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charisma is only skin deep.
