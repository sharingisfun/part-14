What keeps the permanent government spinning on its carousel is the freedom of shamelessness, and that mother's milk of politics, cash.\n\nIn Mark LeibovichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkable look at the way things really work in D.C., a funeral for a beloved television star becomes the perfect networking platform, a disgraced political aide can emerge with more power than his boss, campaign losers befriend their vanquishers (and make more money than ever!), &quot;conflict of interest&quot; is a term lost in translation, political reporters are fetishized and worshipped for their ability to get one's name in print, and, well - we're all really friends, aren't we?\n\nWhat Julia Phillips did for Hollywood, Timothy Crouse did for journalists, and Michael Lewis did for Wall Street, Mark Leibovich does for our nation's capital.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65f8dc727897d1ace733491e28c9a5588130295e","amp;dn":"This+Town+-+Mark+Leibovich+-+Audible+Audiobook+MP3+CBR+64k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65f8dc727897d1ace733491e28c9a5588130295e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,248,220,114,120,151,209,172,231,51,73,30,40,201,165,88,129,48,41,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
