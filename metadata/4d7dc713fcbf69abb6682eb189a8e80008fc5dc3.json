This 1961 trio recording, with his orchestra's rhythm section of drummer Sam Woodyard and Aaron Bell, clearly unveils the maestro's powerful touch, black-and-tan chords, and unstoppable swing, all often overshadowed in the work of his bigger bands. The standard &quot;Body and Soul&quot; shows Ellington's debt to James P. Johnson's Harlem stride style, while &quot;Blues for Jerry,&quot; recalls Count Basie's Kansas City grooves.\n\n&quot;Cong-go&quot; masterfully marries Nigerian highlife and Cuban congorhythms, while Gershwin's &quot;Summertime&quot; and &quot;Springtime in Africa&quot; become surprising, evocative tone poems that foreshadow the avant-garde abstractions of the '70s. There's also a deeply personal rendering of Billy Strayhorn's &quot;Lotus Blossom,&quot; which was not included on the original LP. The last six bonus tracks come from a pair of 1957 sessions with Jimmy Woode on bass. All in all, this disc is a worthy addition to Ellington's other keyboard classics, Money Jungle and Piano Reflections.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
