Highlights include a faithfully swampy cover of Slim Harpo\\\\\\'s \\\\\\&quot;Scratch My Back.\\\\\\&quot;\n\nLeader Kim Wilson\\\\\\'s \\\\\\&quot;Rocket Pocket\\\\\\&quot; is a harmonica showcase a la Little Walter, while \\\\\\&quot;Rich Woman\\\\\\&quot; appropriates the riff from Bo Diddley\\\\\\'s \\\\\\&quot;Diddley Daddy\\\\\\&quot; (the same one the Stones borrowed for \\\\\\&quot;19th Nervous Breakdown\\\\\\&quot;). The bonus track \\\\\\&quot;Things I Forgot to Do\\\\\\&quot; is a nice slow New Orleans style ballad, in which the T-Birds are joined by the horns from Roomful Of Blues.\n\nTracklist\n1.Wait on Time \n2.Scratch My Back \n3.Rich Woman \n4.Full-Time Lover  \n5.Pocket Rocket \n6.She\\\\\\'s Tuff  \n7.Marked Deck \n8.Walkin\\\\\\' to My Baby \n9.Rock With Me \n10.C-Boy\\\\\\'s Blues \n11.Let Me In \n12.Look Whatcha Done - (bonus track) \n13.Please Don\\\\\\'t Lie to Me - (bonus track) \n14.Things I Forgot to Do - (bonus track)\n\nRecorded at Sumet-Bernet Sound Studios, Dallas, Texas in May 1979.\n\nFabulous Thunderbirds: Kim Wilson (vocals, harmonica); Jimmy Vaughan (guitar); Keith Ferguson (bass); Mike Buck (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8256b4cd3b8928090739aa55fcbd148e7e101dc9","amp;dn":"The+Fabulous+Thunderbirds+Girls+Go+Wild%28rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8256b4cd3b8928090739aa55fcbd148e7e101dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,86,180,205,59,137,40,9,7,57,170,85,252,189,20,142,126,16,29,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
