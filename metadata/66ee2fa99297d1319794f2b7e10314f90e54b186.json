A version of Jimmy Liggins' jump-blues classic &quot;Honeydripper,&quot; from 1981's Dr. John Plays Mac Rebennack, spotlights his sparkling boogie-woogie piano, and the set closes with a pair of standards from his latter-day Warner Bros. years (one of which is the unofficial Mardi Gras theme &quot;Goin' Back to New Orleans&quot;). \nWhether it's for a first listen or the perfect road-trip disc, The Very Best of Dr. John has all of the New Orleans master's best recordings in one spot.
