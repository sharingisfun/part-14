All she wants is to move into her new apartment with everything she and her recently passed mother have ever owned. Not excluding their beloved dog, and now Mirabelle's only friend, Spike. But as it usually goes, fate has other plans for her. On moving day she meets not only an angel truly in human form, but an actual angel . . . not so much in human form. This Angel on Earth, her dream guy, Joe, stands for everything she thought was missing from the world. He gives new meaning to a life she had lost all hope on. That is of course until Sebastian, her claimed Guardian Angel, has something to say about it. It's not so simple falling in love while finding out you're the sole key to the survival of the human race. It's never really ever simple, now is it?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ebd28c21d9b2e49bfcc8440f025d2894a2938dd","amp;dn":"Monsters+%26amp%3B+Fairytales+-+Rebecca+Suzanne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ebd28c21d9b2e49bfcc8440f025d2894a2938dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,189,40,194,29,155,46,73,191,204,132,64,240,37,210,137,74,41,56,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
