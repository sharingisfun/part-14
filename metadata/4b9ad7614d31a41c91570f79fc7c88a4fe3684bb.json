Translated by Coleman Barks.\n\nOn Book of Love:\nThe Sufi mystic and poet Jalaluddin Rumi is most beloved for his poems expressing the ecstasies and mysteries of love in all its formsÃ¢â‚¬â€erotic, platonic, divineÃ¢â‚¬â€and Coleman Barks presents the best of them in this delightful and inspiring collection. Rendered with freshness, intensity, and beauty as Barks alone can do, these startling and rich poems range from the &quot;wholeness&quot; one experiences with a true lover, to the grief of a lover's loss, and all the states in between: from the madness of sudden love to the shifting of a romance to deep friendship to the immersion in divine love. Rumi, the ultimate poet of love, explores all &quot;the magnificent regions of the heart,&quot; and he opens you to the lover within. Coleman Barks has made this medieval, Persian-born (present-day Afghanistan) poetic and spiritual genius the most popular poet in America today. This seductive volume reveals Rumi's charms and depths more than any other.\n\nOn Soul of Rumi:\n\nColeman Barks presents entirely new translations of Rumi's poems, published for the first time in The Soul of Rumi. The poems range over the breadth of Rumi's themes: silence, emptiness, play, God, peace, grief, sexuality, music, to name just a few. But the focus is on the ecstatic experience of human and divine love and their inseparability, conveyed with Rumi's signature passion, daring, and insights into the human heart and the heart's longings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b9ad7614d31a41c91570f79fc7c88a4fe3684bb","amp;dn":"Rumi+-+Book+of+Love+and+Soul+of+Rumi+-+Coleman+Barks+-+Epub+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b9ad7614d31a41c91570f79fc7c88a4fe3684bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,154,215,97,77,49,164,28,145,87,15,121,252,124,136,164,254,54,132,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
