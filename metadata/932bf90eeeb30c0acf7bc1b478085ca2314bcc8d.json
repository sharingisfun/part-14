She has three albums that have been certified Platinum or Gold, and has been a feminist icon throughout her career.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI Love Rock 'n' Roll is the second studio album by Joan Jett and the first to feature her backing band The Blackhearts. It is Jett's most successful album to date with over 10 million copies sold, largely due to the success of the title track (which was released as a single soon after the album was released).\n\nEarly copies of the album released during December 1981 ended with the track &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;. However, after the holiday season passed, the track was replaced by &quot;Oh Woe Is Me&quot; on most pressings.\n\nThe initial CD release was in 1992 on Blackheart Records and featured 13 tracks. The album was digitally remastered and reissued on CD in 1998 and featured two additional bonus tracks.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:932bf90eeeb30c0acf7bc1b478085ca2314bcc8d","amp;dn":"Joan+Jett+-+I+Love+Rock+N%27+Roll+%5B1981%5D%5B2006%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"932bf90eeeb30c0acf7bc1b478085ca2314bcc8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,43,249,14,238,179,12,10,207,123,193,180,120,8,92,162,49,75,204,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
