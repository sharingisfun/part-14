Renowned for his hi octane, electro-influenced productions, this record is set to be one of the standout albums of 2012. \n\nTheo Keating, in true maverick style, has forged his own path as Fake Blood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a hard-hitting, multi genre artist with a cult following like no other. His previous releases, ''Mars'' and the ''Fix Your Accent EP'', that features the hit club anthem ''I Think I Like It'', gained rave reviews among press and fans alike, cementing the man as a leader of the scene. \n\nFew DJs have truly trashed the rulebook like Fake Blood. When his remixes snuck onto the dance scene in 2008, he shied away from the spotlight and, like a dancefloor ninja, managed to keep his identity firmly under wraps. There were no gimmicks, no stadium-sized headpieces or fancy dress masks to obscure him, just a desire for club heads to absorb his music without any preconceptions. Four years and four EPs on, Keating is still something of an enigma. \n\nFake Blood has found a home on Different Recordings, which counts club crusaders like Tiga, Felix Da Housecat and Vitalic among its roster, and is finally ready to present his debut album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1173c8b994ae874f9154aa7a2317f6b85ee8ff0b","amp;dn":"Fake+Blood+-+Cells+%282012%29+Album%2C+Mp3+320Kpbs%2C+WEB+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1173c8b994ae874f9154aa7a2317f6b85ee8ff0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,115,200,185,148,174,135,79,145,84,170,122,35,23,246,184,94,232,255,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
