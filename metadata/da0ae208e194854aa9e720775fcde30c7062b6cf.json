Lead singer Kim Ward Encarnacion vocally resembles the Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan. The songs range from the sweet power pop of &quot;Ren,&quot; which has a light, jazz-inflected bridge, to the kinetic drive and drumming of &quot;Colossal Youth,&quot; to the tribal beat and chants that underpin the breezy &quot;Sundays.&quot; The stand-out tracks, though, are the grinding, yearning gem &quot;Soon,&quot; which shifts into chiming guitars and features Encarnacion's most passionate vocals, and the lovely midtempo ballad &quot;Heaven.&quot; Moonpools &amp; Caterpillars have offered an album full of winning melodies whose only flaw is a lack of standout hooks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da0ae208e194854aa9e720775fcde30c7062b6cf","amp;dn":"Moonpools+%26amp%3B+Caterpillars+-+Lucky+Dumpling+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da0ae208e194854aa9e720775fcde30c7062b6cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,10,226,8,225,148,133,74,169,231,32,119,95,205,227,12,112,98,182,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
