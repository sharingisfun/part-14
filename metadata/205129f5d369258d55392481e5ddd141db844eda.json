Instead, the book focuses on techniques specific to drawing accurate depictions of dogs and puppies-from creating a variety of fur types and features to achieving accurate proportions-so that artists can use the knowledge to render their own canine portraits. The book also includes a series of easy-to-follow, step-by-step projects showcasing a range of dog breeds, poses and props. This allows artists to practice their developing skills, guiding them from simple sketches through the study of various techniques to polished renderings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:205129f5d369258d55392481e5ddd141db844eda","amp;dn":"Drawing+Made+Easy%3A+Dogs+and+Puppies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"205129f5d369258d55392481e5ddd141db844eda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,81,41,245,211,105,37,141,85,57,36,129,229,221,209,65,219,132,78,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
