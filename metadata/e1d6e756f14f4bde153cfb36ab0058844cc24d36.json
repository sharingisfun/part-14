Such decisions in the\npreservation and persistent promotion of the Irish culture should never be\nleft to a different spirit as a bureaucrat will never do as well if that\nis the stuff they are made of in showing any competence whatever in aiding\nthe Irish spirit legitimately and in full conscientious sense of idealistic\nduty as that comes only from within if it is there to be had.\n\nThat LP included his beautiful and insightful rendition of &quot;Yesterday when\nI was young&quot; - one of the best songs he had to his credit in my own view - \nand to think they pulled it off the shelves for decades means someone just is\ninane and perhaps brain dead in the shepherding of collective wisdom down there\nI'm afraid to have to say!\n\nEnjoy this music forever and help keep the spirit alive with whatever seed \nno matter how small you can keep turned on for us on this torrent!
