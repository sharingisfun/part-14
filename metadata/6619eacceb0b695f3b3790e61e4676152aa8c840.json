Melissa\n\n\n\nReview from the attendee who provided this show:\n\nOnce in a lifetime! Pre-Mule set, those in attendance at Red Rocks tonight were treated to \nan unbelievable set of acoustic music from Gregg Allman and Warren Haynes. Ã‚â€œRareÃ‚â€ does not \naptly describe this night, nor does brilliant, moving, soulful; or any other adjective one \ncan conjure. Midnight Rider was the first dish served and was followed by Come &amp; Go Blues. \nOld Before My Time and Come On In To My Kitchen both raised the hair on the back of my neck \nas well as many others' too. Beautiful in its simplicity and stirring in its power, this set \nis truly one of the highlights of both Messrs. Haynes' and Allman's career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6619eacceb0b695f3b3790e61e4676152aa8c840","amp;dn":"Gregg+Allman+And+Warren+Haynes+-+2006-09-02+-+Red+Rocks+Amp+in+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6619eacceb0b695f3b3790e61e4676152aa8c840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,25,234,204,235,11,105,95,59,55,144,230,30,70,118,21,42,168,200,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
