Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes. Mr. Mercedes is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable.\n\naudible.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3854523e3e7614410017efc4588c504dafcab848","amp;dn":"Mr.+Mercedes+by+Stephen+King+%28Unabridged%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3854523e3e7614410017efc4588c504dafcab848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,84,82,62,62,118,20,65,0,23,239,196,88,140,80,77,175,202,184,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
