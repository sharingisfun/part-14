Son of Ultron-Empire has released these as they've been coming out on Comixology (at a rate of 2 issues per week, I think) but I've waited until the first 1/2 of the 12-issue series was released to do this torrent.\n\nThis series began as a success but fell victim to the downtown in comics sales of the late 1990's, and to the lateness of Jim Lee (and maybe Scott Williams?). It took 27 months to release the 12 issues of this series. Lee was -- at the time -- the owner and editor-in-chief of the Wildstorm company, which he would sell to DC in 1999.\n\nIn my mind, Divine Right is notable because it was one of the first major comic book series to feature an &quot;Internet computer nerd&quot; protagonist who wants to meet his &quot;online girlfriend&quot; -- a fairly new idea in 1997 as America Online and other services saw millions of Americans use the Internet regularly for the 1st time.\n\nIn latter issues, Divine Right became heavily involved with other Wildstorm characters, such as John Lynch and Fairchild from Gen 13, and Void of the WildC.A.T.s. The series ends with a short crossover, &quot;Divine Intervention&quot;.\n\nEnjoy and seed.  --STF\n\n------\n\nDivine Right: The Adventures of Max Faraday is a twelve-issue comic book limited series created, written, and drawn by Jim Lee and published by Wildstorm from 1997 to 1999. Its protagonist is Max Faraday, a computer science student who inadvertently becomes the receptacle of an incredible mystic power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7d70227754f42e7dfeb3e41cca0dba97cbea5ec","amp;dn":"DIVINE+RIGHT+-+THE+ADVENTURES+OF+MAX+FARADAY+001-006+JIM+LEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7d70227754f42e7dfeb3e41cca0dba97cbea5ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,215,2,39,117,79,66,231,223,235,62,65,204,160,219,169,124,190,165,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
