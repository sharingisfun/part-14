Orienting your mind clearly towards what you want is like the steering your vehicle in the direction you need to go. Kalparisha meditation is a tool designed to enhance and use the power of your mind to create your life, the way you want it.\n\nMind is a very powerful instrument. If properly channelized and used, mind is capable of creating whatever you want, simply with powerful visualizations, even without your active participation towards the end.\n\nHowever, active participation for the process is very important. It is important that you create a clear vision or image of what you want in your mind before you start working towards it.\n\nInstructions:\nBest results can be reaped of Kalpariksha meditation by being very clear about what you want. Write down these three things that you want to accomplish:\n1. Short term vision: something that you want to accomplish in the\nnext two or three months.\n2. Mid-term vision: To be accomplished in the next two or three years.\n3. Long-term vison: To be accomplished in the next five to ten years of\nyour life.\n\nDescribe your vision clearly and in a positive manner. Before you start working with Kalparisksha see if that is what you really want. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always best to have your long-term vision in such a way that it includes everyone.\n\nGo on, Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev.
