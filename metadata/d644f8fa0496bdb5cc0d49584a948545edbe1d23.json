Originally founded as The Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, The Supremes' repertoire included doo-wop, pop, soul, Broadway show tunes, psychedelic soul, and disco. They were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100.\nMost of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, HollandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“DozierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Holland.\nAt their peak in the mid-1960s, The Supremes rivaled The Beatles in worldwide popularity, and their success made it possible for future African-American R&amp;B and soul musicians to find mainstream success. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supremes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supremes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDiana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Anthology: The Best Of Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes\nMotown Records\n1995 edition\nwith covers\n\nDisc 1\n01  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - I Want A Guy  \n02  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Buttered Popcorn  \n03  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Your Heart Belongs To Me  \n04  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Let Me Go The Right Way  \n05  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - A Breath Taking Guy  \n06  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Long Gone Lover  \n07  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - When Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes  \n08  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Send Me No Flowers  \n09  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Where Did Our Love Go  \n10  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Baby Love  \n11  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Come See About Me  \n12  Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Stop!
