He spent his youth in poverty, in a rough neighborhood, known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the BattlefieldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which was part of the Storyville legal prostitution district. His father, William Armstrong (1881Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1922), abandoned the family when Louis was an infant and took up with another woman. His mother, Mary &quot;Mayann&quot; Albert (1886Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1927), then left Louis and his younger sister Beatrice Armstrong Collins (1903Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1987) in the care of his grandmother, Josephine Armstrong, and at times, his Uncle Isaac. At five, he moved back to live with his mother and her relatives, and saw his father only in parades.\n         After dropping out of the Fisk School at age eleven, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. Armstrong developed his cornet playing seriously in the band of the New Orleans Home for Colored Waifs, where he had been sent multiple times for general delinquency, most notably for a long term after firing his stepfather's pistol into the air at a New Year's Eve celebration, as police records confirm.\n         He played in the city's frequent brass band parades and listened to older musicians every chance he got, learning from Bunk Johnson, Buddy Petit, Kid Ory, and above all, Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver, who acted as a mentor and father figure to the young musician. Later, he played in the brass bands and riverboats of New Orleans, and began traveling with the well-regarded band of Fate Marable, which toured on a steamboat up and down the Mississippi River. He described his time with Marable as &quot;going to the University,&quot; since it gave him a much wider experience working with written arrangements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4248486e212163c4e58a7c049ed6aa7e2a0d197","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+574","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4248486e212163c4e58a7c049ed6aa7e2a0d197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,36,132,134,226,18,22,60,78,88,167,192,73,237,106,167,226,160,209,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
