She is, of course, the reason why the gig sold out so quickly, but who is she, really? Gangster Nancy Sinatra. Living meme. Poet of an America that can throw up JonBenet Ramsey or Lindsey Lohan. Well, what did you expect? Elvis is her daddy, Marilyn her mother. Yet every think piece claiming to deconstruct her is reduced to meaningless pixels on a screen when faced with the effect she has on the audience, in the flesh. Grown women (and some men) in floral headbands shed tears or sing themselves hoarse when their idol proffers a microphone, graciously, towards them. She seems genuinely moved, and a little surprised by the level of fervour, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get over you!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she laughs between songs. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mastery of performance, too. Transitioning effortlessly between rich chest voice and a pure, bird-like soprano, the shaky, pathos-laden early performances are a distant memory; now manicured fingers hover over her temple like a gun when she sings Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m tired of thinking that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m fucking crazyÃ¢â‚¬Å“, only to flitter into a semblance of a salute during Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmericanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. A song she asks to add to the setlist part way through.\n\nFascinatingly, there are moments where the brazen emotion strays into a kind of perversely straight camp, not performative enough to be Other, yet monstrously vulnerable, a totem of a tragic femininity. As she takes her place in a single spotlight for the smoky jazz joint number Ã¢â‚¬Å“Million Dollar ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reminiscent of nobody so much as a kind of 21st century Judy Garland. She even stakes a claim for authenticity, thanking the audience for allowing her to tell her Ã¢â‚¬Å“true life storiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ after booze-and-prostitution torch song Ã¢â‚¬Å“CarmenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. When she descends into the photo pit for the extended instrumental during Ã¢â‚¬Å“National AnthemÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ people rush forward to hand her messages in sealed envelopes and, inevitably, long stemmed roses. In turn, she signs autographs, a performer whose chosen medium of pop music is somehow not quite tragic nor (un)real enough, leaving her to appealÃ¢â‚¬â€like she so often doesÃ¢â‚¬â€to the language of the big screen. Who is Lana Del Rey? WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re left, where she wants us most, out there in the dark...\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n2014-07-19 here in the night of the 19th Black Hole of The Pirate Bay around thewaymouth\n\n...a Pisces fish out of water on the dock of The Pirate Bay, born in the year of the Diamond Dog, out on the town around the city upon a hill, up near the top of the Beast Coast of the United Snakes,\nhere and now we are well into one more Saturday night, having it made in the shade from the white heat of the Hot Dog Star, the brightest star in the night sky...\n\nJULY 19 : FESTIVAL OF SIRIUS.\n\nFLITCH DAY. (Dunmore Piory, England) Beginning in 15th century, the monks offered a fitch of bacon as prize for any married couple who could prove to a jury of bachelors &amp; maidens that they had lived together in harmony &amp; fidelity for the past year. Very few took home the bacon.\n\nNICARAGUA: REVOLUTION DAY.\n\nHOT: First of the month of Thermidor (heat) in the French revolutionary calendar.\n\nFESTIVAL OF THE PUZZLEBOX.\n\nFEAST OF CRANKS. ...So crank it up.\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like \nSummertime Sadness \nEverywhere you \nWest Coast.\n\n\n&quot;But soft!  What light through yonder window breaks?  It is the East and Juliet is the sun!  Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon...  Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,  Having some business, do entreat her eyes  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven  Would through the airy region stream so bright  That birds would sing and think it were not night.&quot;\n\n\nLana Del Rey \nYet lives.\nSo far she shines.\nSo still she rules.\nSo still but moved, we happy few, we celebrate!\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-07-18-18h22m19s47.jpg~original&quot;
