Success or failure depends on your ability to create a town that can grow and prosper, and overcome the harsh realities of medieval life!\r\n\r\nGather and manage natural resources for buildings, ensure a plentiful supply of food and water to keep your villagers happy and allocate them jobs to continually improve and expand your settlement. Watch out for travelling artists who can spread illness, fierce bandits and wild animals that attack your townsfolk and extreme weather conditions that threaten their very survival!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e576a40e242c478038a121b91d5d4941eae2c369","amp;dn":"Villagers+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e576a40e242c478038a121b91d5d4941eae2c369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,118,164,14,36,44,71,128,56,161,33,185,29,93,73,65,234,226,195,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
