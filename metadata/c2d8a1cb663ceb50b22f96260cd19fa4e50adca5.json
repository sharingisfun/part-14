The song is an example of Lennon-McCartney collaboration at a depth that happened only rarely after they wrote the hit singles of 1963. This song, and A Day in the Life, are among the notable exceptions.\n\n\n     SIDE A\n01 - We Can Work It Out\t\t(2:14)\n\n     SIDE A\n02 - Day Tripper\t\t\t(2:50)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2d8a1cb663ceb50b22f96260cd19fa4e50adca5","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+We+Can+Work+It+Out+%2845+RPM+single%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2d8a1cb663ceb50b22f96260cd19fa4e50adca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,216,161,203,102,60,235,80,178,47,150,38,12,209,159,164,229,10,220,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
