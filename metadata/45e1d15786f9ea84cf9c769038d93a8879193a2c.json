Other tracks include &quot;Kiss Away,&quot; co-written by producer Billy Sherrill, and &quot;Honey (I Miss You),&quot; an answer to Bobby Goldsboro's &quot;Honey.&quot; The vocal performances are excellent even on the more disposable material, and although nothing here approaches the level of the title track, the album is ultimately rewarding for those whose interest in Wynette extends beyond her greatest hits.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45e1d15786f9ea84cf9c769038d93a8879193a2c","amp;dn":"Tammy+Wynette+-+1968+-+D-I-V-O-R-C-E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45e1d15786f9ea84cf9c769038d93a8879193a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,225,209,87,134,249,234,132,207,156,118,144,56,217,58,136,121,25,58,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
