She has the perfect life--except that she's deeply unhappy. David expects the world of Violet but gives little of himself in return. When she meets Teddy, a roguish small-time bass player, Violet comes alive, and soon she's risking everything for the chance to find herself again. Also in the picture are David's hilariously high-strung sister, Sally, on the prowl for a successful husband, and Jeremy, the ESPN sportscaster savant who falls into her trap. For all their recklessness, Violet and Sally will discover that David and Jeremy have a few surprises of their own. THIS ONE IS MINE is a compassionate and wickedly funny satire about our need for more--and the often disastrous choices we make in the name of happiness.(","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2b799ad212a3bf5e2781e891e7461bfbf891c36","amp;dn":"This+One+Is+Mine+%28Maria+Semple%29+EPUB+%2B+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2b799ad212a3bf5e2781e891e7461bfbf891c36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,183,153,173,33,42,59,245,226,120,30,137,30,116,97,191,191,137,28,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
