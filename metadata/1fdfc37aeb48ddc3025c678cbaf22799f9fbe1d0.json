The single did not chart in the U.S., but in the UK it peaked at #40 the week ending August 27, 1977. The song was ranked 76th on the list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot; by Rolling Stone.\n\n&quot;American Girl&quot; uses standard rock instrumentation of electric guitars (Petty and Campbell), electric bass (Blair), drums (Lynch), and keyboards (Tench). The tempo is fast and &quot;urgent&quot;, and is built on a repeated jangling guitar riff based on a &quot;Bo Diddley beat&quot;.\n\nAs described in Rolling Stone, &quot;The supercharged riff set the template for decades of Petty hits, but it was also a homage to the Byrds: Petty and Mike Campbell's twin guitars mirrored Roger McGuinn's 12-string, infusing the folk-rock sounds of the 1960s with New Wave energy.&quot;\n\nAccording to Tom Petty, The Strokes have admitted to taking the riff for their 2001 single, &quot;Last Nite&quot;, from this song. In a 2006 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Petty said &quot;The Strokes took 'American Girl', and I saw an interview with them where they actually admitted it. That made me laugh out loud. I was like, 'OK, good for you.' It doesn't bother me.&quot; The Strokes played as an opening act for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers for several dates of their 2006 tour.\n\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers are an American rock band from Gainesville, Florida. They were formed in 1976 by Tom Petty, the band's primary vocalist and guitar player, and also consisted of Mike Campbell as the lead guitarist, Ron Blair on bass, Stan Lynch on drums, and Benmont Tench on keyboards. Line-up changes have been few and far between, with Howie Epstein being the bassist from 1982 to 2002 when Blair tired of the touring lifestyle, only to replace Epstein again in 2002 upon his death, and Lynch leaving in 1994 and being replaced by Curt Bisquera and Steve Ferrone.\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers were on the forefront of the heartland rock movement, alongside artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Bob Seger, which arose in the late 1970s and 1980s. The genre eschews the synthesizer-based music and fashion elements being popularized in the 1980s, such as synthpop and New Romanticism in favor of a straightforward classic rock sound and lyrics based on relatable, blue collar issues. While the heartland rock movement fizzled in the 1990s, the band remained active and popular. They still tour regularly and continue to record albums. \n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers have sold more than 80 million records worldwide, making them one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling bands of all time.\n\nHypnotic Eye is the 13th studio album by American rock band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released on July 29, 2014, by Reprise Records. The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, becoming the first Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers album to ever top the chart.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Girl_(Tom_Petty_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Girl_(Tom_Petty_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic_Eye&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic_Eye&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAAmHAagd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAAmHAagd&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:03\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
