The first cartoon series to ever feature a rock and roll group, it immediately became a hit with a 13 score and a 52 per cent share in ratings. Based loosely on the characters of the Beatles as portrayed in their film, A Hard Day's Night, each half hour program consisted of two cartoons (each approximately 8-10 minutes long) and two singalong segments stuck in-between the two episodes. Though the Beatles never took part in the creation and production of the show, save for the fact that their original music was used, the series still remains a favorite among fans who can remember getting up and eating a bowl of cereal while watching it. And thanks to MTV, Disney (who both aired the show sometime around the late 80's early 90's) and bootlegged copies, the show is continuing to enjoy an ever growing number of fans. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/4596/thebeatlescartoons.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/4596/thebeatlescartoons.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Crediti :.\n\nAnno: 1965-1969\nGenere: Animation, Children\nProduzione: USA - ABC\nNumero serie: 3\nCast: The Beatles as The Beatles (singing voice)\nNumero episodi: 39\n\n0=============================0\n\n.: Info Ripping :.\n\nDimensione: 6.52 GB\nVideo Codec: DivX\nVideo Bitrate: 1150\nRisoluzione: 352 x 240\nFPS: 29.970\nQF: 0.454\n\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s\nFreq Audio: 44100Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb132600c607347e7ceba96fa70ca025e210a629","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Cartoon+TV+Series+%5BDVDrip+ENG+Mp3%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb132600c607347e7ceba96fa70ca025e210a629","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,19,38,0,198,7,52,126,124,235,169,111,167,12,160,37,226,16,166,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
