Willie riffs on everything: music, wives, Texas, politics, horses, religion, marijuana, children, the environment, poker, hogs, Nashville, karma, and more. He shares the outlaw wisdom he has acquired over eight decades, along with favorite jokes and insights from friends and others close to him. Rare family pictures, beautiful artwork created by his son Micah Nelson, and lyrics to classic songs punctuate these charming and poignant memories. Willie Nelson has touched millions, and none more deeply than his family, friends, and bandmates, several of whom share, for the first time, intimate stories about the Red Headed Stranger.\n\nFrom teaching a granddaughter to play the guitar to touring with the Highwaymen, from picking cotton while growing up in Texas to being home with the tribe on Maui, Willie takes you on the tour bus and, through candid observations and vivid recollections, gives you a front-row seat to his remarkable world. But beware: &quot;You know you shouldn't be reading this BS, it could ruin you for all time to come,&quot; he says. &quot;You could end up a social outcast like me, an outlaw!&quot;\n\nAt once a road journal written in his inimitable, homespun voice and a fitting tribute to America's greatest traveling bard, Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I DieÃ¢â‚¬â€introduced by Kinky Friedman, another favorite son of TexasÃ¢â‚¬â€is a deeply personal look into the heart and soul of a unique man and one of the greatest artists of our time, a songwriter and performer whose legacy will endure for generations to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89a67f0801606e3659db91f5f9d20d5f48530af8","amp;dn":"Roll+Me+Up+and+Smoke+Me+When+I+Die+by+Willie+Nelson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89a67f0801606e3659db91f5f9d20d5f48530af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,166,127,8,1,96,110,54,89,219,145,245,249,210,13,95,72,83,10,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
