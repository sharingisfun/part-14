Estate agents, mail order lingerie and the invention of central heating: this is medieval England seen from a 21st century comedy perspective.\n\nThrill! as brave knight Sir William De Warrenne comes back from the Crusades and tries to buy a castle with a combined dungeon/gym.\n\nSwoon! as young Lady Anne watches handyman Sam Tree grease a rusty hinge.\n\nSympathize! as lord of the castle Sir John hires the latest top-of-the-range horse, but can't work out what to do with the built-in ashtrays.\n\nAnd get out your dictionary as the medieval equivalent of Gordon Ramsey tries to prepare a banquet with a mandolin and some very old swear words, and a medieval host has some trouble hosting the annual Strictly Come Gavotting competition.\n\nwww.comedy.co.uk Review: [quote]The Castle neatly blends together 'Ye Old England' themes with present day ideas to create a quirky and fun setting for comedy adventures. The characters are all neatly defined, and voiced with gusto (Steven Kynman as street-talking teenager Henry particularly makes us laugh). A very enjoyable first two series, with a good start to the third recently.[/quote]\n\n\nCast:\nJames Fleet\nNeil Dudgeon, \nSusan Earl\nJonathan Kydd\nIngrid Oliver\nSteven Kynman\nToby Ross-Bryant\nMontserrat Lombard\nLewis MacLeod\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/the_castle/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/the_castle/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Castle - S01 - E01 \nThe Castle - S01 - E02 \nThe Castle - S01 - E03 \nThe Castle - S01 - E04 \nThe Castle - S01 - E05 \nThe Castle - S01 - E06\n \nThe Castle - S02 - E01 - Houston We Have An Problemme\nThe Castle - S02 - E02 - Nice To Gavotte You, To Gavotte You Nice \nThe Castle - S02 - E03 - Is This A Turnip That I See Before Me \nThe Castle - S02 - E04 - Pool Party Of Doom \nThe Castle - S02 - E05 - Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Visor \nThe Castle - S02 - E06 - Something Filled With Helium \n\nThe Castle - S03 - E01 - The Dragon Of Mass Destruction \nThe Castle - S03 - E02 - The Pilchards Of Doom \nThe Castle - S03 - E03 - The Snowballs Of Hell \nThe Castle - S03 - E04 - The Vuvuzela Of Terror \nThe Castle - S03 - E05 - Four Wiseguys And A Funeral \nThe Castle - S03 - E06 - There's No Place Like Woodstock \n \nThe Castle - S04 - E01 - Tender Is the Knight \nThe Castle - S04 - E02 - The Only Way Is Ethics \nThe Castle - S04 - E03 - Highlights &amp; Twilights \nThe Castle - S04 - E04 - Boogie Knights \nThe Castle - S04 - E05 - Give Me The Flaming Torch \nThe Castle - S04 - E06 - A Term For The Worse \n\n\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nDuration : 29mn 14s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c242e9a3167a2ee9ca85a24db491ceae1740e9a","amp;dn":"The+Castle+-+S01+to+S04+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c242e9a3167a2ee9ca85a24db491ceae1740e9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,36,46,154,49,103,162,238,156,168,90,36,219,73,28,234,225,116,14,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
