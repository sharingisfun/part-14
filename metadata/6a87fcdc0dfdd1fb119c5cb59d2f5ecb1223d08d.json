Chapters emphasize principles; complementary sections supply applications. The book provides a qualitative introduction to quantum mechanical ideas; a systematic, complete and elaborate presentation of all the mathematical tools and postulates needed, including a discussion of their physical content and applications. \nThe book is recommended on a regular basis by lecturers of undergraduate courses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a87fcdc0dfdd1fb119c5cb59d2f5ecb1223d08d","amp;dn":"Quantum+Mechanics+Volumes+1-2+pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a87fcdc0dfdd1fb119c5cb59d2f5ecb1223d08d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,135,252,220,13,253,209,251,17,156,92,181,157,47,94,203,18,35,208,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
