With designs contributed by more than 50 creative builders across North America, the projects include tables, stools, workstations, benches, laptop stands, shelves, art panels, organizers, headboards, doghouses, dollhouses, and more. A photo of each finished project is accompanied by a list of needed tools and materials, cutting and assembly diagrams, and clear step-by-step instructions.\n\n\n\nBy Philip Schmidt\nPublished by Storey Publishing in 2012\nPDF, Retail, 320 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee14dbcf0a3197fdeb1be67a5bef22d03efc72c","amp;dn":"PlyDesign+%28PDF%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee14dbcf0a3197fdeb1be67a5bef22d03efc72c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,225,77,188,240,163,25,127,222,177,190,103,165,190,242,45,3,239,199,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
