BuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s timeless trilogy is the powerful story of a familyÃ¢â‚¬â€and a nationÃ¢â‚¬â€in transition\n\nThe Good Earth is BuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic, Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning story of Wang Lung, a Chinese peasant farmer, and his wife, O-lan, a former slave. With luck and hard work, the coupleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fortunes improve over the years: They are blessed with sons, and save steadily until one day they can afford to buy property in the House of WangÃ¢â‚¬â€the very house in which O-lan used to work. But success brings with it a new set of problems. Wang soon finds himself the target of jealousy, and as good harvests come and go, so does the social order. Will WangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family cherish the estate after heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone?\n \nThe familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story continues in Sons and A House Divided, when the Revolution sweeping through China further unsettles Wang LungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family in this rich and unforgettable portrait of a family and a country in the throes of widespread national change.\n\nFollow me @livhre\n\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload.

To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub.
