Written in the accessible, easy-to-follow style thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s won The Rev so many followers, this book sifts through the jargon surrounding organic marijuana growing and gets straight to the heart of the matter: the living soil. True Living Organics provides several different ways to create a high-quality living medium for marijuana plants. Dispensing with the basics of how to grow pot, this guide instead gives the reader a new education on what cannabis plants really need and the best way to give it to them. With over 200 color photos illustrating every topic, this book is as easy to use as it is insightful.\n\n\nI'm the original uploader of this fine book since it wasn't available without purchase.\n\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b52d9077a48db5cac35205ffa4258cb57fb75eaa","amp;dn":"True+Living+Organics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b52d9077a48db5cac35205ffa4258cb57fb75eaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,45,144,119,164,141,181,202,195,82,5,255,164,37,140,181,127,183,94,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
