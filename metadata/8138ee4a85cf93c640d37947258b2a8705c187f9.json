Dune The Alternative Edition is a\npainstakingly created new cut that draws on the Theatrical Version (1984), the\nExtended Version (1988), various deleted scenes, and two versions of the\noriginal soundtrack album. Presented in 2.35 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby\nDigital 2.0 stereo sound. The Revised Version 2 replaces V1 and features\nadditional changes and technical improvements.\n\nINTENTIONS FOR THIS FANEDIT:\n\nBoth of the officially released versions of David Lynch's visually amazing\n'Dune' have substantial problems. The Theatrical Version was gutted to the point\nof incomprehension by executive producer Dino De Laurentiis in his quest to make\nit a two hour movie instead of three. The easier-to-follow Extended Version\nassembled for cable TV, with much restored footage, was so incompetently put\ntogether by Universal's MCA TV division that Lynch ordered his name removed from\nthe writing and directing credits.\n\nBroadly, my intention with the Alternative Edition is to improve storytelling\nand flow by preserving the best elements from both official versions of the film\nwhile also integrating some newly available deleted scenes.\n\nThe Alternative Edition does not claim to be a director's cut. It is also based\nmore on the Extended Version of Dune than several other fanedits doing the\nrounds. In this and many other respects the Alternative Edition is a\nsignificantly different take on the film. I have used Herbert's novel and the\n6th and 7th drafts of Lynch's original script as a guide but have also taken my\nown liberties with the material.\n\nCHANGES/CUTS/ADDITIONS (including V.2):\n\n1) MISTAKES. Many of the mistakes exclusive to the Extended Edition have been\nremoved or corrected ? such as atrocious editing, the TV censorship cuts, and\nthe silly repeated/fabricated footage used to set up or pad scenes.\n\n2) COLOR CORRECTION. The 40 or so minutes of extra live footage hastily\nreinserted into the Extended Version by Universal/MCA was never color graded and\nsuffers from color mismatches with the older Theatrical footage. In V.2\ncolour-correction has been applied to all shots, scenes and part-scenes where\nthe mismatches are clearly apparent, which amounts to about 80% of the extra\nfootage. However the missing &quot;blue eyes&quot; of the Fremen have still not been\nrestored - a massive rotoscoping job I chose not to undertake.\n\n3) PROLOGUE. The painted-stills Prologue from the Extended Version has been\nfixed to make it a more accurate and more helpful background to the Dune\nuniverse. It has been shortened and reconfigured to avoid repetition, to avoid\ngiving away plot points, and to correct confusing mistakes. In V.2 the Prologue\nhas been moved to the very start of the film, before any credits and before\nReverend Mother Ramallo's introduction. In V.2 there are also slight changes to\nthe score and the shot selection.\n\n4) NARRATION. The male narration from the Extended Version was chosen for this\nedit and most of it has been preserved, while deleting or correcting occasional\nvoiceover mistakes or misuse by the producers. I have always found this\nnarration to be a more persuasive than Princess Irulan's voiceover from the\nTheatrical Version. In V.2 the narration has been completely removed from one\nscene where the Fremen watch House Atreides arrive on Arrakis.\n\n5) MUSIC. The Extended Version of Dune assembled my Universal/MCA is badly\nre-scored. It inexplicably omits Brian Eno's 'Prophecy Theme' and generally the\nbeautiful score by Toto is used far too often, too repetitively, and at times\nvery inappropriately (eg. action music in a quiet scene). V.1 addressed this\nproblem through restoring Eno's music and favouring scenes and sequences from\nthe Theatrical Version wherever possible. In V.2 the problem is further\naddressed by the removal or re-scoring of the music in 6 more scenes.\n\n6) SCENE ORDER. I have restored to their correct place a number of existing\nscenes that appear in the wrong part of one or both versions of the movie (eg.\nDuncan &amp; Leto's reunion, the drowned baby worm ritual that produces the Water\nOf Life).\n\n7) INTERNAL DIALOGUE. This was used successfully by Herbert in his novel but I\nbelieve it was a colossal mistake to adapt this device so literally to the\nscreen. Many viewers including myself found much of it infuriating. In V.1 a\nhandful of removals and edits were done to the internal dialogue, mostly in the\ndream sequences. In V.2. I have removed or minimized another 14 instances, again\nmostly without cutting any footage. Overall, the effect is a narrative that\ngives less away and unfolds more naturally.\n\n8) DELETED SCENES. Some - but not all - of the deleted scenes that appeared as\nan Extras feature on the 2005 Universal Region 1 DVD release have been\nintegrated into the Alternative Edition. These are rough-looking compared to the\nrest of the film rest but when edited back in these scenes restore plot points,\nwarmth and character. In V.2 I have also performed some basic color correction\non these scenes but the impact is limited given the poor condition of the\nfootage.\n\n9) TRANSFER QUALITY. It was noticed after the completion of V.1 that the Region\n1 DVD Extended Print is actually slightly crisper that the Region 1 DVD\nTheatrical Print. Therefore in V.2 some Theatrical Version footage has been\nreplaced with identical footage from the Extended print, while retaining the\nTheatrical Version's superior audio source.\n\n10) OTHER V.2 CHANGES. Restored the destruction of the Weirding Modules;\nrestored establishing shots in several scenes; restored several shots of Paul's\nfilmbook slideshow; restored and fixed one of the filmbook voiceovers and its\naccompanying shots.\n\nby SPICEDIVER\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nA place beyond your dreams.
