PLAY THIS GOD OF WAR GAME FOR THE PSP ...\n\n\nFILE INFO : \n\n\n- QUALITY RIP WITH NOTHING RIPPED , JUST THE PMF VIDEOS AND AT3 AUDIO WORKED\n  PERFECTLY WITH QUALITY AND TESTED ON THE GAME \n\n\n- WORKING PERFECTLY ON THE JPCSP EMULATOR WITH THE NEXT CONFIGURATION :\n\n  \n  VIDEO : Only GE Graphics + Use Shaders + Disable UBO\n  MEMORY : Ignore invalid memory access\n\n\n\n\n* Gameplay :\n\n\nThe game features gameplay similar to previous installments in the series. It is a third-person action adventure game, where the player controls Kratos, containing quick time events, box-based puzzles and boss fights. The game features new weapons, magical powers and navigational abilities not present in previous games, and has been cited as featuring 25 percent more gameplay than its PSP predecessor Chains of Olympus.\n\nKratos' arsenal includes the &quot;Blades of Athena&quot; and the &quot;Arms of Sparta&quot; (a spear and shield). Kratos also gains the ability &quot;Thera's Bane&quot; (infuses the Blades of Athena with fire) and in this game acts as the &quot;Rage&quot; feature. As with the Items used in God of War III, this ability automatically replenishes itself. Both Arms of Sparta and Thera's Bane are used to overcome environmental obstacles.\n\nThe combat system has been updated to allow Kratos to &quot;pummel enemies to the ground as well as throw them&quot;, and perform air-to-air attacks. An &quot;augmented death system&quot; is also being used.\n\nMagical abilities include the &quot;Eye of Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Scourge of Erinys&quot;, and the &quot;Horn of Boreas&quot;. The relic &quot;Poseidon's Trident&quot; is retained (God of War).\n\nAs with previous games, chests found throughout the game contain orbs and are marked with a corresponding color for the orbs (green, blue, and red). Green Orbs replenish health, blue orbs replenish magic and red orbs provide experience, which in turn allows the upgrading of magical abilities and weapons.\n\nHealth and Magic upgradesÃ¢â‚¬â€Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers respectivelyÃ¢â‚¬â€reappear and can be found in chests, with five items needed for an upgrade. Minotaur Horns also reappear (from God of War III) and upgrade the Fire meter for Thera's Bane.\n\nAs with previous installments, a challenge mode (&quot;Challenge of the Gods&quot;: five &quot;Challenges of Ares&quot; and another eight &quot;Challenges of Athena&quot; that can be unlocked) is included. Another mode has been added (&quot;The Temple of Zeus&quot;) and allows players to sacrifice collected red orbs (both in-game and Challenge) to unlock additional features, such as the &quot;Challenges of Athena&quot;, costumes and bonus videos. A Combat Arena (similar to the version in God of War III) allows players to pick adversaries and adjust the level of difficulty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:635893de75a7c91efc3941831524a176ec097e3b","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+GOD+OF+WAR+-+GHOST+OF+SPARTA+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"635893de75a7c91efc3941831524a176ec097e3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,88,147,222,117,167,201,30,252,57,65,131,21,36,161,118,236,9,126,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
