But the two aren&amp;#039;t parted for long: Bertie moves to a cottage on Baron Chuffnell&amp;#039;s country estate, and &quot;Chuffy&quot; naturally hires the now-available Jeeves for himself. To Bertie&amp;#039;s surprise, Chuffy is also hosting an American millionaire and his fetching daughter, Pauline, who once was engaged to Bertie. When her father decides that Bertie must make an honest woman of Pauline, even though she only has eyes for Chuffy, the millionaire holds Bertie captive on his yacht. Thank goodness Jeeves is there to aid in Bertie&amp;#039;s escape by disguising him ? although the disguise leads to more trouble for Bertie, particularly with the local police. Fortunately, Jeeves just might have a solution that will fix everything. Jonathan Cecil brings to his reading of this lively tale years of experience in delivering Wodehouse&amp;#039;s works to the writer&amp;#039;s many fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31a6688ef09940e47cd9076f3091636080893531","amp;dn":"P.G.+Wodehouse+-+Thank+You%2C+Jeeves+%28Jonathan+Cecil%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31a6688ef09940e47cd9076f3091636080893531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,166,104,142,240,153,64,228,124,217,7,111,48,145,99,96,128,137,53,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
