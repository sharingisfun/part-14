(an acronym for the band's full moniker, Of a Revolution) transformed themselves from local Ohio State University bandmates to Billboard chartbusters over the course of a long, varied career. First, two of the band's demo recordings were hawked on university campuses. Then, news spread about the band's roots rock and reggae-inflected songs, which owed much to the jam band genre. Before long, O.A.R.'s website had turned into a highly-trafficked internet destination, and the group gradually left the college scene for the bright lights of national stardom.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Hey Girl\n02.Delicate Few\n03.Hold On True\n04.If Only She Knew\n05.[Untitled Track]\n06.She Gone (Only In Dreams)\n07.King Of The Thing\n08.Night Shift\n09.About Mr. Brown\n10.Someone In The Road\n11.Here's To You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d01582e350b99636aee1bbef6fdfb042b84b76d9","amp;dn":"O.A.R.+%28Of+A+Revolution%29+-++Risen+%282001%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d01582e350b99636aee1bbef6fdfb042b84b76d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,21,130,227,80,185,150,54,174,225,187,239,111,223,176,66,184,75,118,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
