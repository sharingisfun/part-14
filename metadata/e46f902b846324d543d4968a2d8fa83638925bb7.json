Their talents and skills are so good they are considered as urban legends. One day, a young boy named Tet appears before them, claiming to be the Ã¢â‚¬Å“GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of another dimension where Sora and Shiro are summoned to, in which no violence is allowed and everything is decided by a game. Of the 16 different races residing in this world, Ã¢â‚¬Å“HumanityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the weakest. After having the vast majority of their lands captured by the other races and being driven to the brink of extinction, Sora and Shiro must challenge the intellectual powers of this world with one-of-a-kind battles in order to save Humanity.\n\nEncoded by Iro\n\n\nAnimelist link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUploader's note:\nThese videos are encoded in 10 bit depth, I recommend installing the latest CCCP codec pack or VLC player to view it properly.\n\nFile Info:\nFormat .........................................................: Matroska\nCodec ........................................................: x264 10bit\nFile size .................................................: Average 88 mb\nWidth .......................................................: 1280 pixels\nHeight .......................................................: 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio ...............................................: 16:9\nFrame rate ...................................................: 23.976 fps\nAudio .......................................: Jap Nero AAC Stereo @ 48KHz\nSubs .......................................................: Eng Included \n\n------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e46f902b846324d543d4968a2d8fa83638925bb7","amp;dn":"No+Game+No+Life+%5B720p%5D+mHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e46f902b846324d543d4968a2d8fa83638925bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,111,144,43,132,99,36,213,67,212,150,138,45,143,168,54,56,146,91,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
