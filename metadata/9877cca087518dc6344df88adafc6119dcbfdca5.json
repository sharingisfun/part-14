Geoffrey Larkin, a visiting former agent, has a bitter argument with Frazer, who accuses him of treachery when they were spying in Berlin during the Cold war. Larkin threatens Frazer with a dossier marked 'Wolfman' and next day is murdered, seemingly by a wild animal, the legendary Beast of Midsomer. Frazer's drunkard son Nicky, another ex-spy ,is killed in identical fashion but Barnaby realizes that the 'Beast' is but a cover.
