That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\n\nCan't do the kind of description I'd like, have to keep this going at a fast clip, and I'm really tied up in the no-life I don't lead.\nThe DC reboot began on Wednesday August 1, 2011 with Justice League 001. The DC same day web version has begun as well. How long before they turn their sights on those giving the same electronic stuff out for free? Will I finish this series before they get around to me? Stay tuned!\n\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from  Milj-Mx\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nMillennium 01-08 (1987)\nThe Complete Millennium v1-5 DCP Archive\n\nMillennium Edition
