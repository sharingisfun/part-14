Seth of course is a long-time partner of Circus Company, stretching back to 2008 when he first recorded an EP for us with Patrick Russell. Subb-an may be a new cat to us, but thereÃŠÂ¼s no denying the impact he has made with his releases for some of the strongest tech house labels around.\n\nIn the hands of this formidable duo, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Caller#7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ gets sharpened and honed into a peak-time floor-filler. The vocals from Dave and dOPÃŠÂ¼s Jaw and that inimitable bassline remain intact, with the focus switched to boosting the rhythms that propel this party-starter while a disgruntled caller drops in on Radio KAJU to speak her mind like a true soul sister should.\n\nFull 320kbps version @ www.techconnet.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8bee427cd7ebc5d6774596277e8fddb5ffd27e8","amp;dn":"Dave+Aju+-+Caller+%237+%28Seth+Troxler+%26amp%3B+Subb-an+remix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8bee427cd7ebc5d6774596277e8fddb5ffd27e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,190,228,39,205,126,188,93,103,116,89,98,119,232,253,219,95,253,39,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
