The group is credited with seven number one songs and a host of other Top Ten hits on the Billboard charts, and their vast catalog includes more than 50 albums.\n\nThe members of Commodores, all of whom attended Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, came together as a result of two groups disbanding: the Mystics and the Jays. Initially formed to simply play music as a pastime and to meet girls, the lineup consisted of William King (trumpet), Thomas McClary (guitar), Ronald LaPread (bass), Walter &quot;Clyde&quot; Orange (drums), Lionel Richie (saxophone), and Milan Williams (keyboards). The members nearly went stir-crazy trying to pick a name for the group, but with no success. As a last resort, Orange gave King a dictionary and told him to pick a name -- that name was the Commodores. With Clyde Orange the only learned musician in the group, Commodores began spreading their music throughout their base, which included Tuskegee, Montgomery, and Birmingham, AL. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tMotown/Universal\nCatalog:\t\t3145420962\nIncludes:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue, Log\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Sweet Love\n02.Just To Be Close To You\n03.Easy\n04.Brick House\n05.Three Times A Lady\n06.Sail On\n07.Still\n08.Lady (You Bring Me Up)\n09.Oh No\n10.Nightshift\n11.Machine Gun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d762f3754b0626839272866465693ebba3dc182","amp;dn":"20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+The+Commodores+%281999%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d762f3754b0626839272866465693ebba3dc182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,118,47,55,84,176,98,104,57,39,40,102,70,86,147,235,186,61,193,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
