Six months later Catherine's engineer husband Clem joins the crew of another submarine,the 'Orpheus',to discover the fate of the 'Hermes',and captained by Frances Kelly,who is in an affair with married crew-man Samson. Also on board is salvage expert Raymond Hopkins,who plays Frances and Clem a recording of Catherine's last words,implying that the 'Hermes' was swallowed by something huge.
