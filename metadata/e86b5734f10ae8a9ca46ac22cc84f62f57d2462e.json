It was released on 11 May 1979, through Fiction Records. It was later released in the United States and Australia with a slightly different song line-up as Boys Don't Cry.\nThe record company decided which songs were put on the album, as well as the cover artwork, without Robert Smith's consent. For all Cure albums since, Smith has ensured he is given complete creative control over the final product before it goes on sale.\n&quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, a soundcheck with vocals sung by Michael Dempsey, was not supposed to be on the album, and was removed for the American release. Smith has stated that &quot;songs like 'Object' and 'World War' and our cover of 'Foxy Lady' were [Chris Parry's] choice&quot;\n\n01 10.15 Saturday Night\n02 Accuracy\n03 Grinding halt\n04 Another day\n05 Object\n06 Subway Song\n07 Foxy Lady\n08 Meat Hook\n09 So What\n10 Fire In Cairo\n11 It's Not You\n12 Three Imaginary Boys\n13 The Weedy Burton","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e86b5734f10ae8a9ca46ac22cc84f62f57d2462e","amp;dn":"The+Cure-+%281979%29+Three+Imaginary+Boys++Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e86b5734f10ae8a9ca46ac22cc84f62f57d2462e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,107,87,52,241,10,232,169,202,70,172,34,204,132,246,47,87,210,70,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
