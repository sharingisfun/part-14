Happy Holidays baby!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Little Steven Van Zandt\n\n------\n\nLeave it to Little Steven to come up with an exquistely hip and fun Christmas set that perfectly balances rockin' chestnuts with deep-vault obscurites. While tracks such as the Kinks' &quot;Father Christmas,&quot; Clarence Carter's &quot;Backdoor Santa,&quot; and the Ramones' &quot;Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)&quot; are perennial favorites for those who require something a bit more jumpin' than Bing Crosby, the presence of Bob Seger's killer &quot;Sock It to Me Santa&quot; and Keith Richards's &quot;Run Rudolph Run&quot; alone make CHRISTMAS A GO-GO a seasonal must-have. Other stand-out Yuletide jams include Roy Wood's &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday,&quot; Soupy Sales's &quot;Santa Clause is Surfin to Town,&quot; and the ridiculously funky &quot;I'll be Your Santa&quot; by Rufus Thomas.\n\n01 - Keith Richards - Run Rudolph Run\n02 - Bob Seger and the Last Heard - Sock it to Me Santa\n03 - Ramones - Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight)\n04 - Darlene Love &amp; the E Street Band - All Alone on Christmas\n05 - Clarence Carter - Back Door Santa\n06 - The Len Price 3 - It's Christmas Time Ebenezer\n07 - Wizzard - I Wish It Could be Christmas Every Day\n08 - The Fab Four - Silent Night\n09 - Tina Sugandh - White Christmas\n10 - The Chevelles - Come All Ye Faithful Surfer Girls\n11 - The Brian Setzer Orchestra - Santa Drives a Hot Rod\n12 - Soupy Sales - Santa Claus is Surfin' to Town\n13 - Cocktail Slippers - Santa's Coming Home\n14 - Joe Pesci - If It Doesn't Snow on Christmas\n15 - Boss Martians - 3 Ghosts\n16 - Rufus Thomas - I'll Be Your Santa Baby\n17 - The Chesterfield Kings - Hey Santa Claus\n18 - The Electric Prunes - Jingle Bells\n19 - The Kinks - Father Christmas\n20 - Jean Beauvoir - Merry Christmas to All the World\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 10/21/2008\nUPC: 856385001756\nLabel: Wicked Cool Record\nCatalog Number: 500175","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0758a017230114522a9131ae0545386df5384d2","amp;dn":"Little+Steven%27s+Underground+Garage+Presents+CHRISTMAS+A+GO-GO+%5Bf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0758a017230114522a9131ae0545386df5384d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,117,138,1,114,48,17,69,34,169,19,26,224,84,83,134,223,83,132,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
