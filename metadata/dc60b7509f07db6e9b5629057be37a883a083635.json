The first issue was released in 2006 and, as of 2008, six individual issues and a hardcover volume collecting the series have been released, all published by Vancouver, Canada independent comic book publisher Arcana Studio.\n\nIn the timeless land of Haraway, a robot girl, Tesla, is given the gift of life from her creator, Wilhelm the Tinkerer. Tesla meets Huxley, the monster boy, who happens to be the son of her creator's chief rival. Together the two break into- and out of- ancient fortresses, fight robots, and travel from the depths of the ocean to the skies above as they attempt to solve the mystery of the plague that has stricken their town.\n\nThe Clockwork Girl and Huxley live in two different worlds and have fathers who hate each other. Huxley's father, Dendrus the Grafter, made a castle as an ode to the beauty and power of nature. The Clockwork Girl's father, Wilhelm the Tinkerer, made a castle, narrow and precise, as a tribute to technology.\n\nHuxley is a mutant circus boy with one horn, fangs, and two hearts. The Clockwork Girl is her father's own scientific creation, born of his need to be a respected man of science. He creates her in order to win an award and gain respect, but he doesn't anticipate that Huxley, whom he hates, will fall in love with her. Huxley meets up with the Clockwork Girl and teaches her some independence since she was only just created and still doesn't know about the world.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc60b7509f07db6e9b5629057be37a883a083635","amp;dn":"The+Clockwork+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc60b7509f07db6e9b5629057be37a883a083635","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,96,183,80,159,7,219,110,155,86,41,5,123,227,122,136,58,8,54,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
