Into the mix they also added a comparatively sophisticated jazz element Ã¢â‚¬â€ which is particularly prominent throughout their earliest efforts. The incipient septet featured the respective talents of Doug Gray (vocals), Toy Caldwell (guitar/vocals), his brother Tommy Caldwell (bass/vocals), George McCorkle (guitar), Paul Riddle (drums), and Jerry Eubanks (flute/sax/vocals). Their free-spirited brand of Southern rock was a direct contrast to the badass rebel image projected by the Outlaws or Lynyrd Skynyrd. This difference is reflected throughout the 1973 long-player The Marshall Tucker Band. The disc commences with one of the MTB's most revered works, the loose and limber traveling proto-jam &amp;quot;Take the Highway.&amp;quot; The improvised instrumental section features some inspired interaction between Toy Caldwell and Eubanks. This also creates a unique synergy of musical styles that is most profoundly exhibited on the subsequent cut, &amp;quot;Can't You See.&amp;quot; Caldwell's easygoing acoustic fretwork babbles like a brook against Eubanks lonesome airy flute lines. The remainder of the disc expounds on those themes, including the uptempo freewheelin' &amp;quot;Hillbilly Band.&amp;quot; Unlike what the title suggests, the track is actually more akin to the Grateful Dead's &amp;quot;Eyes of the World&amp;quot; than anything from the traditional country or bluegrass genres. &amp;quot;Ramblin'&amp;quot; is an R&amp;amp;B rave-up that leans toward a Memphis style with some classy brass augmentations. The effort concludes on the opposite side of the spectrum with the tranquil gospel rocker &amp;quot;My Jesus Told Me So,&amp;quot; offering up Caldwell's fluid guitar work with a sound comparable to that of Dickey Betts. &amp;quot;AB's Song&amp;quot; is an acoustic folk number that would not sound out of place being delivered by John Prine or Steve Goodman. This eponymous effort established the MTB's sound and initiated a five-year (1973-1978) and seven-title run with the definitive Southern rock label, Capricorn Records.
