Brooke disagrees, and challenges Brad and Daddy-O to a guys versus girls Shed marketing contest! The girls struggle to create a Shed calendar (which puts Hazel in a very sticky situation), while the guys invent the one and only &quot;Pig-a-Pult&quot; to launch sandwiches into the sky. Not to be outdone, the Shed Pimps come up with their own marketing scheme... which, conveniently for them, revolves around setting up a kissing booth they promote on social media.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 05-Aug-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6eeb33d6812f083cac8b92f8993193acabf7ba1","amp;dn":"The.Shed.S01E02.HDTV.x264-OMiCRON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6eeb33d6812f083cac8b92f8993193acabf7ba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,238,179,61,104,18,240,131,202,200,185,47,137,147,25,58,202,191,123,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
