Traditional vocal pieces of Bulgaria have been re-arranged and professionally conducted by Bulgaria&amp;#039;s finest conductors and turned into an unforgettable, haunting experience. Even if you are not much in to A Capella or Folklore, you should definitely give them a try as their sound is most unique.\n\nThis is the first volume, recorded in 1986. I will also upload the second volume, so be sure to check out my torrent list.\n\n  \nCheck out my other torrents for folk, avant-garde, jazz and experimental music, all ripped in FLAC.\n\nUnfortunately, my bandwidth is somewhat limited, but I will continue to seed for a very long time, so just be patient ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:492675a15fe49b3c90460e9bcbbb21d0170ad3e7","amp;dn":"Le+Myst%C3%83%C2%A8re+des+voix+Bulgares+-+Volume+I+%281986%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"492675a15fe49b3c90460e9bcbbb21d0170ad3e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,38,117,161,95,228,155,60,144,70,14,155,203,187,33,208,23,10,211,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
