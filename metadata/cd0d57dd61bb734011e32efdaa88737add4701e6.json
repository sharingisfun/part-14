Verckys led Franco's band from 1964-1969 before forming VÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©, and Vintage Verckys offers a refreshing jolt of sax-oriented early-'70s soukous. Soukous was well on its well to becoming a totally guitar-dominated sound, and Verckys' braying sax solos during the sebenes (rave-up sections) of tracks like &quot;Baluti&quot; counted as an innovation. But VÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ© didn't cut entirely against the grain -- the rhumba foundation of Congolese music is apparent in &quot;Marcela Tozangana,&quot; exceptional guitar playing marks &quot;Sakumuna,&quot; and Verckys' sax, the harmony vocals, and the guitar coalesce magnificently at the end of &quot;Mama Djele.&quot; The sound quality is a bit ragged, but these tracks were recorded in Africa 30 years ago, when well-rehearsed musicians still ruled and the vitality of the music was all-important. The sense of fresh frontiers being discovered and old \nbarriers broken down is readily apparent in &quot;Vivita,&quot; as great horn arrangements and vocals ride over the loping rhythm section for nearly ten minutes. Great music from a formative era of African pop. ~Don Snowden (Allmusic)\n\n''Classic Congolese afro-pop. Fans of Afro-Beat who are looking for something less strident and more melodic than Fela Kuti's brand of funk-jazz might really enjoy this album. Definitely worth checking out!'' ~DJ Joe SIxpack\n\n01. Sakumuna\t\n02. Baluti\t \n03. Marcelo Tozangana\t\n04. Ah Ngai Matinda\t\n05. Bea\t \n06. Bilobela\t\t\n07. Londende\t \n08.
