Featuring Carl Perkins, Jimmy Rowles, Barney Kessel and Don Fagerquist! Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw were among the most famous and beloved figures in swing music both as clarinet soloists and orchestra conductors. They were still very active musically in 1957, when Buddy De Franco decided to record a series of sessions paying homage to them. \r\n\r\n\r\nThirty-five performances were recorded (including four medleys containing three songs each) in four extended sessions made on four consecutive days and with two different groups (guitarist Barney Kessel, however, is present on most of the tracks).\r\n\r\nThe first two sessions included trumpeter Don Fagerquist, tenor saxophonist Georgie Auld and pianist Carl Perkins. The second group includes trumpeter Ray Linn and another modern jazz pianist: Jimmy Rowles.\r\n\r\nThese two companion volumes include the complete LPs FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER ON CD!: &quot;I Hear Benny Goodman &amp; Artie Shaw&quot;, &quot;Buddy De Franco plays Benny Goodman&quot;, &quot;Buddy De Franco plays Artie Shaw&quot;, &quot;Wholly Cats&quot; and &quot;Closed Session&quot;.\r\n\r\nCD 1:\r\n01.
