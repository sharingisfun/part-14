It was an .iso with five .wmv files zipped together. When I unzipped them they were all separate so I put them in Microsoft Movie Maker and saved it as an .mp4. The quality isn't too bad but this is the best one out there trust me. I have looked all over for this documentary. It's not on YouTube and the other version of it didn't get uploaded right so it just sat around with six peers and no seeder.\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://911inacademia.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://911inacademia.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n1 hour 13 minutes\nMP4 \n\nComing this fall, Ã¢â‚¬Å“9/11 in the Academic Community,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a Winner of the University of Toronto Film Festival, is a unique film that documents academiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treatment of critical perspectives on 9/11 by exploring the taboo that shields the American governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative from scholarly examination. Through a powerful reflection on intellectual courage and the purpose of academia, the film aims at changing intellectual discourse on 9/11 and the War on Terror.\n\nAs well as probing the repercussions several scholars have endured due to their investigation of 9/11, this documentary provides an analysis of impairments in professional inquiry, ranging from the failure to critically reflect on terms functioning as thought-stoppers (such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“conspiracy theoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to the structural approach that restricts inquiry to the broad implications of 9/11 while shutting out enquiry into the events of the day itself. Morton Brussel, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has stated: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The main thesis of the film concerns the silence of the academic community on this vital issue. I think it is extremely important and very well produced.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAs 9/11 served as the rationale for the Global War on Terror, the expansion of the military and intelligence complex, the invasion of other countries in violation of international law, and the curtailing of civil liberties, the film provides an inspiring demonstration of intellectual courage that will cause many scholars to reflect on the academyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role and strength to dismantle the war system. As Alvin A. Lee, President Emeritus of McMaster University, has stated in his endorsement of the film: academics should Ã¢â‚¬Å“stand sufficiently outside society intellectually to see, understand, and interpret what is going on.\n\nAdnan Zuberi\nDirector and Producer\n9/11 in the Academic Community","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1790c7cc751b16c540014946e3f4e987e37cbaa","amp;dn":"9-11+in+the+Academic+Community","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1790c7cc751b16c540014946e3f4e987e37cbaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,121,12,124,199,81,177,108,84,0,20,148,110,63,78,152,126,55,203,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
