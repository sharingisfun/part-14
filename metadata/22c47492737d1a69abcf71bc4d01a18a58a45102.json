Meet Rally Vincent and Minnie May. By day, they work at the Chicago gun shop that they own. By night (or holidays or week-ends), they moonlight as a pair of bounty hunters called the Gunsmith Cats. Rally is an expert at firearms, being able to judge the condition of a gun with a glance, and being an expert marksman. Minnie May is younger and less disciplined; and has an absolute fascination with explosives. Lots of explosives. Especially big ones. Together, they form an unbeatable team; much to the consternation of the local ATF bureau. Set in the city of Chicago, this action-adventure series features a lot of gunfights, car chases and general mayhem.\n\nAudio: English/Japanese/DC\nSubtitles: English\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c47492737d1a69abcf71bc4d01a18a58a45102","amp;dn":"cor+ova+gunsmith+cats+DVDrip+x264+ENG+JAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c47492737d1a69abcf71bc4d01a18a58a45102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,196,116,146,115,125,26,105,171,207,113,188,77,1,161,138,88,164,81,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
