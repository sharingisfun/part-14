You're Dead!\nEasy\nEpic\nWar Pigs (Black Sabbath)\nFalling To Pieces\n\nPuffy walks out during &quot;War Pigs&quot; due to taunts from the band about his playing. He had hurt his ribs during bungee jumping in New Zealand. Patton takes over drums on the song.\n\nThis is a recording from the original broadcast to a Metal tape and kept safe for many many years. It was converted a few years ago to MP3 - sorry, no idea where the tape is now, so this is what there is! It includes the Nestles ad performance that has not been broadcast again. \n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17e21c861a8037d7c427c87f10c5967a5aa626e","amp;dn":"Faith+No+More+-+July+30+1990+the+original+Triple+J+Broadcast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17e21c861a8037d7c427c87f10c5967a5aa626e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,126,33,200,97,168,3,125,124,66,124,135,241,12,89,103,165,170,98,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
