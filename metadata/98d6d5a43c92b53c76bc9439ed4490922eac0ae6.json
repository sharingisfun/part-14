These experiences are then juxtaposed with moments of intense beauty and excitement,such as the connection that can be felt with an audience. All of the songs on DESTROYED were written by Moby on the road during the small hours of the night, when his insomnia was in full tilt. The silent urban nightscapes provided much inspiration for this album. \n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98d6d5a43c92b53c76bc9439ed4490922eac0ae6","amp;dn":"Moby+-+Destroyed+%5Bmp3-128-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98d6d5a43c92b53c76bc9439ed4490922eac0ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,214,213,164,60,146,181,60,118,188,148,57,237,68,144,146,46,172,10,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
