Actually, James had been with Motown earlier, though nothing had come of it. After growing up in Buffalo and running away to join the Naval Reserves, he ran away from the Navy to Toronto, where he was in a band with future Buffalo Springfield members Neil Young and Bruce Palmer, and with Goldy McJohn, later of Steppenwolf. As the Mynah Birds, they signed to Motown and recorded, though no record was ever released. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.69 Times\n02.Below The Funk (Pass The J)\n03.Call Me\n04.Dance Wit' Me\n05.Fire And Desire\n06.Ghetto Life\n07.Happy (Lady Sings The Blues Love Theme)\n08.Hard To Get\n09.Make Love To Me\n10.Money Talks\n11.Mr. Policeman\n12.My Love\n13.Standing On The Top\n14.Super Freak\n15.Tear Drops\n16.Throw Down\n17.Give It To Me Baby\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ef5f8ec1fe8d5d6de36d94e0e4b81cd7ad232c","amp;dn":"Rick+James+-+Street+Songs+%26+Throwin%5C%27+Down+%281986%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ef5f8ec1fe8d5d6de36d94e0e4b81cd7ad232c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,239,95,142,193,254,141,93,109,227,109,148,224,228,184,28,215,173,35,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
