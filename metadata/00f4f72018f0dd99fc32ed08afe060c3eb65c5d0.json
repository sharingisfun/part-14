The original album on Atlantic was a monster seller thanks to the title track, practically the group's signature tune (number one on the pop charts, number three on R&amp;B), but &quot;Groovin'&quot; was only one small strong point on the album of the same name. &quot;Find Somebody&quot; marked a return to the group's garage band sound with a psychedelic twist, including phased fuzztone guitars and some catchy lyrics and choruses. &quot;How Can I Be Sure&quot; is the second-best-known song off of this album, but it has a fully successful companion piece, &quot;I'm So Happy Now,&quot; which applies similar instrumentation to very different (but pleasing) effect. Gene Cornish's &quot;I Don't Love You Anymore&quot; could be the finest pop song in the band's repertory apart from &quot;How Can I Be Sure,&quot; with a delectable guitar part, scrumptious melody, and delicious chorus. &quot;You Better Run&quot; was more than a year old when it turned up on this album, and its garage band sensibilities are a bit more primitive than those of &quot;Find Somebody,&quot; but it's a great piece of rock &amp; roll. The band turns in one superb Motown cover, &quot;A Place in the Sun,&quot; done in a surprisingly subdued fashion. And for a finale, Cavaliere and Brigati turn in an exultant period piece, &quot;It's Love,&quot; whose soaring lyrics are matched by guest artist Hubert Laws' flute -- alas, his presence would point the way toward less effective, more disjointed work in the group's future, as they moved more deeply into psychedelia.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f4f72018f0dd99fc32ed08afe060c3eb65c5d0","amp;dn":"The+Young+Rascals+-+Groovin%27+%5B1967%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00f4f72018f0dd99fc32ed08afe060c3eb65c5d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,244,247,32,24,240,221,153,252,50,237,8,175,224,96,195,235,101,197,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
