What were the factors that affected the wars outcome? Why did the Axis lose? And could they, with a different strategy, have won? Andrew Roberts's acclaimed new history has been hailed as the finest single-volume account of this epic con?ict. From the western front to North Africa, from the Baltic to the Far East, he tells the story of the warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the grand strategy and the individual experience, the cruelty and the heroismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as never before.\n\nIn researching this magnificently vivid history, Roberts walked many of the key battlefields and wartime sites in Russia, France, Italy, Germany, and the Far East, and drew on a number of never-before-published documents, such as a letter from Hitler\\\\\\'s director of military operations explaining the reasoning behind the FUhrer\\\\\\'s order to halt the Panzers outside DunkirkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a delay that enabled British forces to evacuate. Roberts illuminates the principal actors on both sides and analyzes how they reached critical decisions. He also presents the tales of many little-known individuals whose experiences form a panoply of the extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice, as well as the terrible depravity and cruelty, of the Second World War.\n\nMeticulously researched and masterfully written, The Storm of War gives a dramatic account of this momentous event and shows in remarkable detail why the war took the course it did.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9934c79c5bc06f5ffa8426c0d92960ac6d9ac0","amp;dn":"The+Storm+of+War+-+A+New+History+of+the+Second+World+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9934c79c5bc06f5ffa8426c0d92960ac6d9ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,153,52,199,156,91,192,111,95,250,132,38,192,217,41,96,172,109,154,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
