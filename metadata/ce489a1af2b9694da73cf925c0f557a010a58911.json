Millions died; billions more perished in the aftermath. One doesn't send a sociopath on such a mission. A sociopath might not stop. Chinran did stop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but in the process nearly lost his sanity and his soul.\n\nBut one of ChinranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s men was a sociopath going in. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a trained sociopath with the knowledge and firepower to take out entire tactical teams, evaporate through security cordons and change identity at will. Who do you send after a killer like that? ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one answer: the man who trained him. The man who made him.\n\nRead by Stephen Bowlby\nFormat: M4A\nLength: 11 hrs and 32 mins\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce489a1af2b9694da73cf925c0f557a010a58911","amp;dn":"Michael+Z.+Williamson+-+Rogue+%28Freehold%3A+Grainne+War+%234%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce489a1af2b9694da73cf925c0f557a010a58911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,72,154,26,242,185,105,77,167,60,249,37,192,245,87,160,16,165,137,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
