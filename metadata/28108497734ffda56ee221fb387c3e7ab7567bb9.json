Vandread, as a science fiction space opera, combines elements of action, romance, ecchi, comedy, and mecha elements. Vandread presents a mix of comedy ranging from slapstick humor to subtle humor. It also utilizes well-animated characters and cleanly rendered CG action sequences.\n\nor just in normal words it a very nice anime ;3\n\nPlot\nSet in a universe where men and women are completely segregated (on completely different planets: Mejere by the women, Taraak by the men), the gender wars are more than just a metaphor.\n\nMale protagonist Hibiki Tokai, a third-class laborer, takes up a bet to steal a high-tech humanoid robot, known as a Vanguard, from the male attack force battleship about to fight the &quot;evil females&quot;. Caught on board when it takes off, the battleship is suddenly attacked and all males evacuate, with the exception of Hibiki, Duelo McFile, and Bart Garsus. Stuck on board and held as prisoners with female pirates all around, things seem to have hit an all-time low, until the retreating males retaliate by firing torpedoes at the ship, to prevent it from falling into women's hands.\n\n*WARNING* If you lack a sense of humor or dont like perverted speeches do the following, Dont watch it and go see a doctor.\n\nFeel free to leave a comment if you like(d) it and please be positive being negative wont help you nor other people it only ruins the mood.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28108497734ffda56ee221fb387c3e7ab7567bb9","amp;dn":"Vandread+complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28108497734ffda56ee221fb387c3e7ab7567bb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,16,132,151,115,79,253,165,110,226,33,251,56,124,62,122,183,86,123,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
