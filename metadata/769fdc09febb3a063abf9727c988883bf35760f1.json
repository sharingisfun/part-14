Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five players. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare. \n\nIrresistably colorful on the surface, Dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike. This is one of the reasons that the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience, so that the rest of the world can experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can provide. \n\nGet a taste of the game that has enthralled millions. It just might be your next addiction.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n====================\n\nMinimum System Requirements: \n* OS: WindowsÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ¶Ã‚Â¼Ã¢â€Â¬Ã‚Â½ 7 / Vista / Vista64 / XP\n* Processor: Pentium 4 3.0GHz\n* Memory: 1 GB for XP / 2GB for Vista\n* Graphics: DirectX 9 compatible video card with 128 MB, Shader model 2.0.
