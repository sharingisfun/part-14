Their style drew influences from blue-eyed soul, new romantic, rock, reggae and jazz. Since its early days the main driving force behind the band was singer Mick Hucknall, who by the time the band broke up in 2010 was the only original member left.\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs of Love 2010\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\nSay You Love Me\nYou Make Me Feel Brand New\nStars\nYou've Got It\nFor Your Babies\nIf You Don't Know Me By Now\nIt's You\nBeside You (Re-Recorded)\nHolding Back The Years\nSmile\nI Have The Love\nEv'ry Time We Say Goodbye\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1823a9d42ac532e87e8a9fe09f0f0e5ed71b6693","amp;dn":"Simply+Red+-+Songs+of+Love+2010+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1823a9d42ac532e87e8a9fe09f0f0e5ed71b6693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,35,169,212,42,197,50,232,126,138,159,224,159,15,14,94,215,27,102,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
