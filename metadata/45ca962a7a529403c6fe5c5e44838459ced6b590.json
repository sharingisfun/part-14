It is an education in itself.\nIn recent years rebel music has become more popular and Eire Og have most certainly helped to do this and keep the history of Irelands great musical tradition alive.\nThis album is a must for all lover of Irish rebel music.\n\n/Eire Og - 01 - Merry Ploughboy - Auf Weidersehen To Crossmaglen - Tioc.mp3\n/Eire Og - 02 - Sunday, Bloody Sunday.mp3\n/Eire Og - 03 - Pearse Jordan.mp3\n/Eire Og - 04 - Tom Williams.mp3\n/Eire Og - 05 - Let The People Sing - TakeIt Down From The Mast - This.\n/Eire Og - 06 - Bring Them Home.mp3\n/Eire Og - 07 - The Boys Of The Old Brigade - Cromlin Road Jail.\n/Eire Og - 08 - Joe McDonnell.mp3\n/Eire Og - 09 - Sean Soouth, ROll Of Honour - Go On Home.mp3\n/Eire Og - 10 - S.A.M.
