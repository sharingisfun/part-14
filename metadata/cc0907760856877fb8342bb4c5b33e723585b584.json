Travis Rogers. Craig's office was on Madison Avenue and his adventures were fairly standard PI fare. He worked alone, solved cases efficiently, and feared no man. As the promos went, he was &quot;your man when you can't go to the cops. Confidentiality a specialty.&quot;\n\nThis series has been produced with various spellings of the primary character name. Barrie Craig, Confidential Investigator is one of the few detective radio series that had separate versions of it broadcast from both coasts. Even the spelling changed over the years. It was first &quot;Barry Crane&quot; and then &quot;Barrie Craig&quot;. NBC produced it in New York from 1951 to 1954 and then moved it to Hollywood where it aired from 1954 to 1955. It attracted only occasional sponsors so it was usually a sustainer.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOTRR Certification Information:\n\nSeries Name: Barrie Craig, Confidential Investigator\nCertification Status: OTRR Certified Accurate\nCertification Date: December 1, 2007\nCertification Version: Version 3 (June 13, 2008)\nNumber of CDs: 2\n\n\nNOTE: Updated Release!
