Somerset Maugham novel was the source for the fair-to-middling Greta Garbo vehicle The Painted Veil. In a situation comparable to the plotlines of most of her silent films, Garbo is lovelessly married to Herbert Marshall, but carries a flaming torch for George Brent. (Also harking back to Garbo's silent days is the fact that neither one of the men in her life is particularly interesting!) Marshall, a brilliant physician, is compelled to go into the interior regions of China to quell a cholera epidemic. He knows that Garbo has been having an affair with politician Brent, and chivalrously gives her the choice of remaining with Brent or accompanying him. Fearing a scandal, Brent bids farewell to Garbo. Once they're in the midst of the epidemic, Garbo tirelessly works by her husband's side; eventually she falls in love with him for the first time. Seriously injured in a peasant uprising, Marshall hovers near death. Brent reappears, offering to take Garbo back with him. She refuses, electing to stay with her husband no matter what the future brings. Among the supporting players in The Painted Veil are Warner Oland and Keye Luke, one year away from their memorable pairing in Fox's Charlie Chan films. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025617/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025617/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnglish subtitles\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3449069/the-painted-veil-en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3449069/the-painted-veil-en&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nRichard Boleslawski\n\n\n        Greta Garbo\t ... \tKatrin Koerber Fane\n\tHerbert Marshall\t... \tDr. Walter Fane\n\tGeorge Brent\t... \tJack Townsend\n\tWarner Oland\t... \tGeneral Yu\n\tJean Hersholt\t... \tHerr Koerber\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:20:54\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x528\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1213 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,13 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e130e95255271b2b500a1702de0bf51b84d51c10","amp;dn":"The+Painted+Veil+%281934%29+Greta+Garbo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e130e95255271b2b500a1702de0bf51b84d51c10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,48,233,82,85,39,27,43,80,10,23,2,222,11,245,27,132,213,28,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
