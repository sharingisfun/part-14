On the way there, they run a stop sign in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. They are arrested and taken to the local court. But all is not as it seems: the courthouse and the &quot;prison&quot; are a maze of zany booby- traps and deadly contraptions. The antics of the captured couple as they try to escape from the mad judge and his bizarre family make up the rest of this unusual film.\n\n\nImdb:       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102558/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102558/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n             Users: (10,149 votes) 192 reviews | Critics: 14 reviews\n           \n             Imdb: 4.2/10\n\nRuntime:     94 min\n\nYear:        1991\n\nGengre:      Adventure | Comedy \n\nScource:     Dvd| Retail |Pal\n\nRars:        No\n\nSubs:        Danish\n             Finnish\n             Norwegian\n             Polish\n             Portuguese\n             Swedish\n             German\n             Spanish\n             Greece\n             Czech\n\nFor the hearing \nimpaired :   English\n             German        \n\nAudio:       English (Dolby Digital)\n             German\n             Spanish (2S L/R stereo)\n\nImage:       Widescreen 1.85:1 \n              \nExtras:      None\n\nFormat:      Dvd\n\nMenu:        Yes\n\nStripped     No\n\nDirector:    Dan Aykroyd\n\nWriters:     Peter Aykroyd (story)\n             Dan Aykroyd (screenplay)\n\nStars:       Chevy Chase\n             Dan Aykroyd\n             John Candy\n\n\n\n\n    \n                      ENJOY COMMENT &amp; SEED!
