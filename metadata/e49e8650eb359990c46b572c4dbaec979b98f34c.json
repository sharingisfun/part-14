How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquartersÃ¢â‚¬â€the GoogleplexÃ¢â‚¬â€to show how Google works.\nWhile they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of GoogleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow (until GoogleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s IPO nobody other than Google management had any idea how lucrative the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ad business was), Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more.\nThe key to GoogleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineersÃ¢â‚¬â€free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseusesÃ¢â‚¬â€and gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire.\nBut has Google lost its innovative edge? It stumbled badly in ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â€Levy discloses what went wrong and how Brin disagreed with his peers on the China strategyÃ¢â‚¬â€and now with its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete?\nNo other book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with In the Plex.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e49e8650eb359990c46b572c4dbaec979b98f34c","amp;dn":"In+The+Plex+-+How+Google+Thinks%2C+Works%2C+and+Shapes+Our+Lives+by+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e49e8650eb359990c46b572c4dbaec979b98f34c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,158,134,80,235,53,153,144,196,107,87,44,77,186,236,151,155,152,243,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
