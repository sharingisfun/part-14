His simple riffs have been copied by millions and his songs have been covered too many times to be remembered. &quot;Maybellene&quot;, &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;, &quot;Carol&quot;, &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot;, &quot;Around &amp; Around&quot; and all the other original gems included here are simple two-and-a-half-minute songs that convey all the sheer power and emotion of Rock 'n' Roll. Budget compilation of some of his greatest hits.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Maybellene\n[02] Oh Baby Doll\n[03] Beautiful Delilah\n[04] No Particular Place To Go\n[05] Rip It Up\n[06] Brown Eyed Handsome Man\n[07] Roll Over Beethoven\n[08] School Day\n[09] Sweet Little Sixteen\n[10] Reelin' And Rockin'\n[11] Johnny B.
