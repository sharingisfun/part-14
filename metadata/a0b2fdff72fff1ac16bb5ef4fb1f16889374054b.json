Papazoglou is regarded as one of the founders of the so-called Thessaloniki school of contemporary popular Greek music, a mixture of Rock-and-Roll, traditional Greek folk music and rebetico.\n \nHis songs  Ah Ellada (Oh Greece), Nobody sings Here (Edo kanis den tragouda), August (Augoustos) and Part time Buddha, part time Koudas (Pote Boudas, pote Koudas) remain popular favourites decades after their release dates.\n \nFamous for his live concerts and his distinctive vocal delivery, NikosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most popular works were his collaborations with Manolis Rasoulis and Nikos Xydakis as well as his own explorations of the borderlands between RÃ¢â‚¬â„¢n'R, traditional Greek folk music and rebetico.\n \nHis record label, Round Records (Strogili Diski) brought to light several talented younger musicians, but his contributions as a producer and sound technician to most of the underground rock scene of Greece in the 80s, at his Agrotikon Studio, remain rather unknown.\n \nNikos Papazoglou was nicknamed Ã¢â‚¬Å“the IndianÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ due to the red scarf he was wearing. He died after a long battle with cancer.
