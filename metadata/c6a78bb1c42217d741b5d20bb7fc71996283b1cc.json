Five Finger Death Punch&amp;#039;s music sure does a swift \n          job of living up to such a bold statement. Clutching the listener upon impact, the   \n          band&amp;#039;s proper debut, &quot;The Way Of The Fist,&quot; is a rollercoaster of a metal album that \n          will appeal not only to the most cynical of metal-heads, but those who don&amp;#039;t         \n          primarily pay attention to the genre as well. It&amp;#039;s got something for everyone. Thanks\n          to frontman Ivan Moody, who some may remember from a little band by the name of      \n          Motograter, we are treated to a voice in the genre that can pull off a limitless     \n          range of styles and push it forward with passion. Backing him up are an odd          \n          assortment of co-horts; hailing from the post-grunge band U.P.O., we have Zoltan     \n          Bathory on guitars, with bassist Matt Snell (formerly of Deadsett) and ex-W.A.S.P.   \n          (yes, you heard me, W.A.S.P.!) members Darrell Roberts (guitar) and Jeremy Spencer   \n          (drums) rounding out the line-up. Truly, it is their diverse backgrounds that come   \n          together to bring such a rich and unique sound. Not to mention that each member is in\n          top form and puts on one tight performance. You can listen to this ten track CD      \n          thoroughly and everything blends seamlessly without letting up for a moment. To be   \n          honest, the only flaws are that they don&amp;#039;t show off just how diverse they can be     \n          (first single &quot;The Bleeding&quot; stands alone) and in the end, the album is just too     \n          brief. Regardless, Five Finger Death Punch&amp;#039;s sound is one that actually sounds       \n          modern, especially when placed in a wasteland where every other metal band emerging  \n          sounds alike. &quot;The Way Of The Fist&quot; is a satisfyingly addictive metal album that just\n          about anyone can appreciate.                                                         \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Ashes                       [03:44]                                        \n                 02.The way of the fist         [03:59]                                        \n                 03.Salvation                   [03:21]                                        \n                 04.The bleeding                [04:29]                                        \n                 05.A place to die              [03:40]                                        \n                 06.The devil&amp;#039;s own             [04:13]                                        \n                 07.White knuckles              [04:10]                                        \n                 08.Can&amp;#039;t heal you              [03:04]                                        \n                 09.Death before dishonor       [03:54]                                        \n                 10.Meet the monster            [04:23]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               38:57 min                                       \n                                                67,3 MB                        \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a78bb1c42217d741b5d20bb7fc71996283b1cc","amp;dn":"Five_Finger_Death_Punch-The_Way_Of_The_Fist-%28Retail%29-2008-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a78bb1c42217d741b5d20bb7fc71996283b1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,167,139,177,196,34,23,215,65,181,210,11,183,252,113,153,98,131,177,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
