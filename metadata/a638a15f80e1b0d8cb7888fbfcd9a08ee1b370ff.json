Dupieux also directed the ad, which featured a yellow puppet named Flat Eric nodding his head to the sound of the track while riding in a pickup truck. Flat Eric later appeared in the music video for &quot;Flat Beat&quot;.\n\nAfter &quot;Flat Beat&quot;, Oizo released his first album in 1999, Analog Worms Attack, featuring a single of the same name.&quot; (Wikipedia)\n\n\n1  \t   \tBad Start (1:46)\n2 \t  \tMonophonic Shit (3:56)\n3 \t  \tNo Day Massacre (4:17)\n4 \t  \tSmoking Tape (1:31)\n5 \t  \tLast Night A DJ Killed My Dog (4:28)\n6 \t  \tThe Salad (3:03)\n7 \t  \tBobby Can?t Dance (2:47)\n8 \t  \tAnalog Worms Attack (4:52)\n9 \t  \tOne Minute Shakin (1:13)\n10 \t  \tInside The Kidney Machine (4:51)\n11 \t  \tMiaaaw (4:23)\n12 \t  \tFlat 55 (2:22)\n13 \t  \tFeadz On (1:11)\n14 \t  \tAnalog Wormz Sequel (8:39)\n15 \t  \tFlat Beat (5:17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a638a15f80e1b0d8cb7888fbfcd9a08ee1b370ff","amp;dn":"Mr+Oizo+-+1999+-+Analog+Worms+Attack+%28mp3%2F192%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a638a15f80e1b0d8cb7888fbfcd9a08ee1b370ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,56,161,95,128,225,176,216,203,120,136,251,252,217,160,142,225,179,112,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
