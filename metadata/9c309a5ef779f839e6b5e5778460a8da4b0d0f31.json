Now the blueprint of how a father gave his son vast power in order to accomplish a greater scheme is revealed. Partly told through Wilson's own journal entries, juxtaposed with Tommy's swashbuckling deep sea adventures with his trusty companions Peter and Sue, the story is at once a prequel and a parallel story to the ongoing series.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c309a5ef779f839e6b5e5778460a8da4b0d0f31","amp;dn":"The+Unwritten+-+Tommy+Taylor+and+the+Ship+That+Sank+Twice+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c309a5ef779f839e6b5e5778460a8da4b0d0f31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,48,154,94,247,121,248,57,230,181,229,119,132,96,168,218,75,13,15,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
