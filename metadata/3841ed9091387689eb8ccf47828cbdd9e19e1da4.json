Chanakya, perhaps is the only personality who has been accepted and revered as a genius both by Indian and Western scholars. He is a historical milestone in the making of India amidst tremendous upheavals \n\nHis foresight and wide knowledge coupled with politics of expediency founded the mighty Mauryan Empire in India. He was a great laureate of economics with a glittering intellect to perceive the intricate dynamics of the various economic activities and principles.\n\n\nQuite remarkably, long before Clausewitz came up with the quote, which said &quot;War is only the continuance of state policy by other means&quot;, Chanakya had already written it in his book Ã¢â‚¬ËœChanakyanitiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Most of his views were so farsighted that they appeared to be prophesies. Talking on diverse subjects such as corruption, he commented very rightly, &quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just as difficult to detect an officialÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dishonesty as it is to discover how much water is drunk by the swimming fish&quot;.\n\nThis great statesman and philosopher was far better than Machiavelli, Aristotle and Plato, exemplifying his potentiality and influential status. He has been criticized for his ruthlessness and trickery and praised for his profound political wisdom. Chanakya, the timeless man, was in pursuit of truth fearlessly 2000 years ago and was proved right with VivekanandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words, &quot;Arise, Awake, Sleep not till the goal is reached&quot;.\n\n\nMore Info &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3841ed9091387689eb8ccf47828cbdd9e19e1da4","amp;dn":"chanakya-niti.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3841ed9091387689eb8ccf47828cbdd9e19e1da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,65,237,144,145,56,118,137,235,140,207,71,130,140,189,217,225,158,29,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
