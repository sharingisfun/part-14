Request must be made via PM (Only follow the .torrents a couple days afterwards they wont be read)\n\n2. Know exactly what you want !!! (Which company makes it, and which add-on/s)\n\n3. your 1st request must be in the Subject (this helps me by not having to open/read messages multiple times)\n\tPlease use this format: ex. REQ Lago - Georender 6\n\n4. If you have multiple request include those others in the main body of the message.\n\n5. Have patiance !!!! I may not have it ATM but ill keep my eyes open for them.\n\nAll request not in the format above will be ignored and erased. Just imagine your getting 20 PM&amp;acute;s aday with\nRequest, can you help me ect. This is so i can quikly reconize your Req. even after being in my box a few days.\n\nThx Mogz, PopArt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af2a930988fce11acf751198fa2c8ca51c91a165","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Capt.Sim+-+Legendary+Mig+21UM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af2a930988fce11acf751198fa2c8ca51c91a165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,42,147,9,136,252,225,26,207,117,17,152,250,44,140,165,28,145,161,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
