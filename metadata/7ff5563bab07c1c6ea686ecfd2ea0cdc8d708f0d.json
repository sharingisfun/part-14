Release: 1996. 320kbps. With Covers.\n\nDarrell McCall was a hardcore traditional country singer, keeping the flame of pure, gritty honky tonk alive during the country-pop crazes of the '60s and '70s. Though he never had many hits -- only his debut single, (A Stranger Was Here) broke the Top 20 -- he gained a dedicated cult following among fans of traditional country, which translated into a string of moderate hits that ran from the early '60s until 1980. The five-disc box set The Real McCall collects all of the recordings he made during that time, including every song he cut for Starday, Wayside, Atlantic, American Heritage, Columbia, and RCA, among others. In addition to the released recordings, The Real McCall also features a handful of demos (including some he made for Jimmy Reed), radio transcriptions, and radio commercials -- everything a dedicated fan could ever want from McCall. Of course, such an exhaustive approach means that listening to the box is a daunting task for anyone but the most devoted fan, yet it will satisfy all of his hardcore followers with its excellent sound and lavish, detailed packaging. ~ Thom Owens\n\n143 tracks from the man who was hard country when it wasn't fashionable, all recorded from 1960-81 for Starday, Wayside, American Heritage, Columbia, RCA &amp; others; also inc. blues demos for Jimmy Reed &amp; rare commercials &amp; transcriptions;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ff5563bab07c1c6ea686ecfd2ea0cdc8d708f0d","amp;dn":"Darrell+McCall+-+The+Real+McCall+-+1960-1981+-+Bear+Family","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ff5563bab07c1c6ea686ecfd2ea0cdc8d708f0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,245,86,59,171,7,193,198,234,104,110,207,210,234,12,220,141,112,143,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
