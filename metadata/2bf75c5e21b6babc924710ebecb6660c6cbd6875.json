Nastos &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/things-have-got-to-change-r1708599&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/things-have-got-to-change-r1708599&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMarty Ehrlich's genius lies within an ability to reinvent his music while\nretaining his unique voice on the alto saxophone. A vocal quality, the slight\nhuman cry of his tone, and the angular but not obtuse lines of his melodies have\nmade Ehrlich a true original, and for his followers, immediately\nrecognizable. While Ehrlich refuses to stand pat in the size or depth of his\nensembles, the four-piece setting has been a constant over the years, but in\nspecific terms of favorite players, the Rites Quartet may be the finest he has\never assembled. Longtime drummer Pheeroan AkLaff joins cellist (not bassist)\nErik Friedlander and trumpeter James Zollar to play new music that is\nconsistently scintillating. Zollar's pithy, lithe, but sinewy lines work so well\nwith Ehrlich's sound, while rhythmically and harmonically, Friedlander cannot be\neclipsed by anyone on the cello. The resultant progressive jazz within and out\nof the jazz tradition, should keep listeners on their toes through this grand\nexperience of creating absorbing, truly new music. The rich harmonies and spiky\naccents always associated with Ehrlich's music are extant from the opener &quot;Rites\nRhythms,&quot; with groove cello from Friedlander and a solid trumpet solo by\nZollar. Ornette Coleman's tandem lyricism is referenced in &quot;Dung,&quot; not\nstandardized, but expounded upon in a bop notion, while Friedlander's cello\ntakes center stage during the romantic reverence of &quot;Some Kind of Prayer&quot; and\nthe bouncy, jig-flavored waltz &quot;On the One,&quot; where Ehrlich's lyrical,\ntangent-busting alto departs into the stratosphere. But there is much more on\nthe second half of the date, as the quartet ups the ante further for the somber\nundertones and wonderfully quirky bop funk of &quot;Slices of Light,&quot; very\nreminiscent of AkLaff and Ehrlich's past groundbreaking work with guitarist\nMichael Gregory Jackson. The juxtaposed blues bop of &quot;Song for Tomorrow,&quot; and\ndark, diffuse, stark, hauntingly resonant, free &quot;From Strength to Strength&quot; are\npreludes for a mighty version of Julius Hemphill's &quot;Dogon A.D.,&quot; a definitive\nhip and funky creative crossover in 11/8 time. There's little more to describe\nor critique about this masterful progressive jazz made by some of the best\nplayers in the business, all at the top of their game, making some of the most\nremarkable music of their careers from start to finish. Where certain political\nand social areas in the world must change, we should all be appreciative that\nEhrlich stays the course. This is a must-have item, and without question, one of\nthe very best jazz recordings of 2009.\n\n--\n\nBy Stef\n\nBy Stuart Broomer &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34117&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34117&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Pachi Tapiz &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2009/11/marty-ehrlich-rites-quartet-things-have.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2009/11/marty-ehrlich-rites-quartet-things-have.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bf75c5e21b6babc924710ebecb6660c6cbd6875","amp;dn":"Marty+Ehrlich+Rites+Quartet+-+Things+Have+Got+To+Change+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bf75c5e21b6babc924710ebecb6660c6cbd6875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,247,92,94,33,182,186,188,146,71,16,235,236,182,102,12,108,189,104,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
