Thomas and I have played together for years and have done several tours together. Learn from our experience playing both together and with other groups. We will teach you some of the &quot;tricks from the road&quot; that we have learned over the years.\n\nYou'll learn how to find the &quot;holes&quot; to fill. I'll show you what to fill in those holes. We'll talk about leaving space, backing up others, the &quot;one drop&quot;, some slick chord progressions, soloing concepts, staying in the pocket and much more!\n\nIn the second DVD, Thomas and I let loose and play around with the groove. You'll see in real time how we put together a groove, solo over it and interact with one another.\n\nIf you're serious about learning funk styles, you'll want to check out this Master Class DVD. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagedomino.com/?p=597945&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagedomino.com/?p=597945&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5815334a34b1353ce5b5add67a764ba9bc54db35","amp;dn":"Willie+Myette+-+Funk+Master+Class+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5815334a34b1353ce5b5add67a764ba9bc54db35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,21,51,74,52,177,53,60,229,181,173,214,122,118,75,169,188,84,219,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
