Paul Blart (James) is a single suburban dad attempting to make ends meet by working as a mall security guard. Paul takes his job very seriously; unfortunately the same can't be said for the shoppers he deals with on a daily basis. That all changes the day that Santa's little helpers shut down the mall and start taking hostages, including Paul's daughter and his main squeeze. Realizing that no one knows the mall better than the man who's paid to guard it, Paul mounts his Segway and speeds to the rescue. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 31 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 384\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c83b44f84ad9f77f125ece68d374156f754e20a2","amp;dn":"Paul+Blart%3A+Mall+Cop%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c83b44f84ad9f77f125ece68d374156f754e20a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,59,68,248,74,217,247,127,18,94,206,104,211,116,21,111,117,78,32,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
