Now on the book's fiftieth anniversary comes this new translation by Breon Mitchell, one that is faithful to Grass' style and rhythm, restores omissions, and reflects more fully the complexity of the original work. This is the story of Oskar Matzerath, a dwarfish hunchback detained in a mental hospital, convicted of a murder he did not commit. From his third birthday when he received a tin drum, it has become the means of his expression, allowing him to draw forth memories from his past as well as from the Nazi era. Oskar's imaginative distortion and exaggeration reveals a startlingly true portrayal of the human situation. \n\n\nby GÃƒÂ¼nter Grass ; [new translation by Breon Mitchell] \n\n\nRead by Paul Michael Garcia.\n\n [Ashland, Or.] :, Blackstone Audio,, 2009.\nCharacteristics: 2 sound discs (ca. 25 hr., 30 min.) :,digital.\n\nBorn on October 16, 1927 in Gdansk, Poland, GÃƒÂ¼nter Grass was a member of the Hitler Youth in the 1930s.
