They treasured gardens both as places for relaxation and as plots to grow ornamental plants as well as fruits and vegetables. The soothing sound of bubbling fountains often added further to the pleasures of life in the garden. Romans constructed gardens in every corner of their empire, from Britain to North Africa and from Portugal to Asia Minor. Long after their empire collapsed, the gardens they had so carefully planted continued to exert influence in the farflung corners of their former world. \n\nThis book describes the variety of Roman gardens throughout the empire, from the humblest to the most lavish, including such well-known places as HadrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Villa in Tivoli and the gardens of Pompeii and Herculaneum. The continued influence of Roman gardens is traced though Arabic, medieval, and Renaissance gardens to the present day. Many of the lavish illustrations were commissioned for this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a4e865ccf5b5587b54e299832ebc3aef9567637","amp;dn":"Gardens+of+the+Roman+World+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a4e865ccf5b5587b54e299832ebc3aef9567637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,78,134,92,207,91,85,135,181,78,41,152,50,235,195,174,249,86,118,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
