Those albums showcased Mono's sound in transition from its thundering post-rock origins. For My Parents, again with Milarsky's WMO renamed the Holy Ground Orchestra, nearly completes that move. Each of Mono's previous experiments with classical instrumentation and arrangements has gone a little deeper and wider. But these five lengthy tracks move them further toward the edge. Here they've created a music that seamlessly melds the repetitive, hypnotic, density, and propulsion we've come to expect from post-rock as a genre, yet turns them upside down, focusing increasingly on detail, space, ambience, melody, expansive harmonics, and intervallic architectures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b357b2897b8a68978ca513e9c79646dd07c1651","amp;dn":"Mono+-+For+My+Parents+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b357b2897b8a68978ca513e9c79646dd07c1651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,53,123,40,151,184,166,137,120,202,81,62,156,121,100,109,208,124,22,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
