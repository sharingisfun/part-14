It was created in 1910 by \norchid grower Sir Jeremiah Colman, of the mustard family.\n\nGatton Park is a 250-acre estate near Reigate, Surrey.\nThe park was landscaped by Lancelot 'Capability' Brown\nin the 1760s and comprises woodlands, grasslands, ponds\nand a large lake. The beautiful formal gardens were\nadded by Sir Jeremiah Colman of mustard fame during the\ntime he lived there. Following the Edwardian trend in\nall things Japanese, Sir Jeremiah employed Edward White\nto create a Japanese garden beside the Engine Pond in\n1910.

It is a moated Tudor garden \ncreated in 1519 by Sir Philip Tilney. He was a member \nof an ancient knightly family and he became by marriage,\na first cousin of Elizabeth I.\n\nShelley Hall, was a large brick house built in the \n1520s by Sir Philip Tilney (d. 1533). \nHe was a member of an ancient knightly family \nwho gained additional status by the marriage of first \nhis cousin, and then his sister, to Thomas Howard, \nDuke of Norfolk. By the first marriage he became a \ncousin of the future Elizabeth I. Only a part of TilneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nhouse has survived, but the layout suggests a court-yard\nplan house that had an axial relationship to a \nsquare moated site to the east. This moated site had \nbeen postulated as the site of an earlier house, but the \nfortunate existence of a manorial survey dated 1519-33 \nclarified the set-up by describing a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“gardeynÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on the \neast side of the manor buildings that was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“motyd on \nevery sydeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Analysis of the survey and the present \ntopography suggest that the moated site adjoined an \narea of marshland and that the approach to the house \nwas contrived to present views of the garden to visitors,\nbut that actual access to it was limited to a favoured few.\n\nAVI File Details\nName..........: Lost Gardens - Shelley Hall Suffolk (23 Sep 2010).avi\nFilesize......: 519Mb\nRuntime.......: 00:49:24\nVideo Codec...: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate.: 1.3Mbps\nframe Size....: 720x404\nframe Rate....: 25fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 160Kbps\nAudio Freq....: 44KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo \n\n===========================================================\n\nLost Gardens - Warwick (30 Sep 2010)\n\nOriginally produced in 1999 by Flashback Television for Channel Four.\n\n\nThis week:\n\nThe gardening team work on uncovering the lost world of a \n19th-century Warwick grocer's detached pleasure garden in Warwick.\n\nAVI File Details\nName..........: Lost Gardens - Warwick (30 Sep 2010).avi\nFilesize......: 520Mb\nRuntime.......: 00:49:31\nVideo Codec...: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate.: 1.3Mbps\nframe Size....: 720x404\nframe Rate....: 25fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 160Kbps\nAudio Freq....: 44KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo \n==========================================================\n\n\nLost Gardens - Ambleside (07 Oct 2010)\n\nOriginally produced in 1999 by Flashback Television for Channel Four.\n\n\nThis week: Ambleside - Lake District\n\nWhen Frances and Jim Philbrook moved into their Victorian \ncountry house in the heart of the Lake District, they never \nsuspected the plot they'd inherited was once a much admired \nand extraordinary garden.\n\nWhy would they? Apart from some neatly trimmed lawns, most \nof their grounds were hidden beneath decades' worth of \nbramble and rhododendrons, which had knitted together so \ndensely that they allowed little light to penetrate the space.\n\nSoon after arriving, the team discovered the outline of\nstone and concrete structures. After several days of\ndigging, steps were revealed that led down to a network\nof underground tunnels and chambers held up by stone\npillars.\n\nA deed map of 1889 and old Ordnance Survey maps of the\narea showed that a glass structure had once covered\npart of the hollow and the team believed this shady\nspot would have been used as a fernery, a popular\nfeature in Victorian times.\n\n'I was amazed at this discovery and have felt a\ntremendous responsibility for it ever since - there's\nonly a couple of similar ferneries left in the\ncountry,' says Jim proudly. Eller How dates from 1841\nand among the early owners was Anne Jemima Clough,\nsister of poet Arthur Hugh Clough. A key figure in the\nsuffragette movement, she opened the house as a school\nfor young ladies in 1852 and ran this for ten years\nbefore becoming the first principal of Newnham College,\nCambridge. In 1862 it was bought by keen horticulturist\nHenry Boyle, whose work in the garden can still be seen\ntoday.\n\nAVI File Details\nName..........: Lost Gardens - Ambleside (07 Oct 2010).avi\nFilesize......: 519Mb\nRuntime.......: 00:49:28\nVideo Codec...: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate.: 1.2Mbps\nframe Size....: 720x404\nframe Rate....: 25fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 160Kbps\nAudio Freq....: 44KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo \n==========================================================\n\nLost Gardens - Perthshire (14 Oct 2010)\n\nOriginally produced in 1999 by Flashback Television for Channel Four.\n\n\nThis week:\nThe lost garden on the estate of Dunira, Near Comrie, Perthshire was owned by \na wealthy laird, and the decayed estate now holds a tragic family secret. \nThe team makes a start on restoring this 1920s Thomas Mawson-designed garden.\n\nThe Dunira Estate, about 3 miles from Comrie and 3 miles from lovely Loch\nEarn in Perthshire, is a place of great beauty and tranquillity. It also \nhas a most interesting history. The father of William Macbeth bought it \nin 1919 as a wedding present for his son.\nMacbeth's father had made his fortune as a ship building magnate on the \nClyde during the First World War, and in the period of high unemployment \nduring the 1920s he arranged for a train load of unemployed shipyard \nworkers to be decanted at the local station every day to transform the \nEstate. The 9-hole golf course, putting green and a cricket pitch which \nthey created have all gone now, but the Lost Gardens and the magnificent \nArboretum remain, just a couple of minutes walk from East Turret.\n\nAmongst numerous other staff, 22 full-time gardeners were employed by the \nestate. \n\nMacbeth became morosely depressed and neglected the gardens after his only \nson and heir was still-born. \n\nThe main house was all but totally destroyed by fire in 1947 when it burned\nfor 1 week. \n\nThe eastern annex / wing of the house remained occupied but in very poor \nand decaying state until early 21st century when it was finally demolished \nas neglect made recovery unfeasible. \n\nNB: The estate is now in separate ownership. The gardens are overgrown but \ncan be rejuvenated. The site has detailed planning consent for a large \ndetached dwelling plus coach-house / garage block.\n\nAVI File Details\nName..........: Lost Gardens - Perthshire (14 Oct 2010).avi\nFilesize......: 520Mb\nRuntime.......: 00:49:34\nVideo Codec...: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate.: 1.2Mbps\nframe Size....: 720x404\nframe Rate....: 25fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 160Kbps\nAudio Freq....: 44KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo \n==========================================================\n\nLost Gardens - Sutton Stop (21 Oct 2010)\n\nOriginally produced in 2001 by Flashback Television for Channel Four.\n\n\nThis week: Sutton Stop, Coventry\n\nA lock-keeper's garden blooms as Monty Don and his channel 4 team \nrecreate a scene from the forgotten past of Coventry's waterways.\n\nExcavation of a garden near Coventry draws a frustrating blank, but \na lucky find in a record office plunges the team right into the heart \nof the life, and garden, of lock keeper Richard Sutton's residence in \n1807-1876.\n\nSutton became famous in the area for selling his produce to passing \nbarges and the road leading to the lock was named Sutton Stop in his \nhonour. Richard's garden was well-known to 19th-century travellers, \nbut over the years became neglected and overgrown. \n\nAVI File Details\nName..........: Lost Gardens - Sutton Stop (21 Oct 2010).avi\nFilesize......: 522Mb\nRuntime.......: 00:49:43\nVideo Codec...: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate.: 1.2Mbps\nframe Size....: 720x404\nframe Rate....: 25fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 160Kbps\nAudio Freq....: 44KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo \n===========================================================\n\nLost Gardens - Chatham (28th Oct 2010)\n\nResearch and restoration on a Georgian officer's terrace \nin Chatham Historical Dockyard.\n\nBy piecing together evidence from the ground, archives and from a detailed model \nof the Chatham Historical Dockyard dated 1774, the team is able to attempt one \nof the only accurate Georgian town garden restorations.\n\nAVI File Details\nName..........: Lost Gardens - Chatham (28th Oct 2010).avi\nFilesize......: 520Mb\nRuntime.......: 00:49:34\nVideo Codec...: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate.: 1.2Mbps\nframe Size....: 720x404\nframe Rate....: 25fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 160Kbps\nAudio Freq....: 44KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo \n==========================================================\n\n\nLost Gardens - Penjerrick (4th Nov 2010)\n\nSadly the final episode.\n\nLost Gardens - Presenter Monty Don, garden historian Dr Toby Musgrave and landscaper \nAnn-Marie Powell discover a tropical paradise near Falmouth in Cornwall.\n\nThe lower garden at Penjerrick was created at a time when intrepid botanists were \nbringing home exotic flora from around the world. \n\nBesides the explosions of rhododendrons, there are minor forests of bamboo and \nrhubarb overgrown to resemble a series of Seventies parasols.\n\nSomewhere amid the kitsch chaos is an impressive line of tree ferns, long since \nthreatened by asphyxiation.\n\nThe tangled mass must be hacked aside, sensitively, in a bid to recreate the odd \nsplendour of the original Penjerrick.\n\n\nAVI File Details\nName..........: Lost Gardens - Penjerrick (4th Nov 2010).avi\nFilesize......: 522Mb\nRuntime.......: 00:49:43\nVideo Codec...: DivX5\nVideo Bitrate.: 1.2Mbps\nframe Size....: 720x404\nframe Rate....: 25fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 160Kbps\nAudio Freq....: 44KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba79066f8d57a6d5e65cf83c3c3d89b073a0cb36","amp;dn":"Lost+Gardens++%28Channel+4+-+1999+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba79066f8d57a6d5e65cf83c3c3d89b073a0cb36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,121,6,111,141,87,166,213,230,92,248,60,60,61,137,176,115,160,203,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
