They'll take any job, legal or illegal, to keep fuel in the tanks and food on the table.  But things get a bit more complicated after they take on a passenger wanted by the new totalitarian Alliance regime.  Now they find themselves on the run, desperate to steer clear of Alliance ships and the flesh-eating Reavers who live on the fringes of space.\n\nSource: Blu-ray 1080p\n\nVideo resolution: 1920x1080\n\nVideo framerate: 23.976 fps\n\nVideo codec: x264\n\nVideo bitrate: 8000 kbit/s\n\nAudio channels: 6\n\nAudio codec: AAC-LC\n\nAudio bitrate: 256 kbit/s Adaptive\n\nAudio tracks: English, English Commentary, Spanish, French, German\n\nSRT Subtitles: English, Spanish, Dutch\n\n\nI recommend CCCP+CoreAVC (http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php?title=CoreAVC) and ZoomPlayer.
