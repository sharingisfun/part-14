Pipeline is a compilation of The Question backup feature from Detective Comics. The Question #37 is part of the Blackest Night storyline.\n\nBoth are digital rips.\n\nCully Hamner's character design was well rationalised and made Renee Montoya a believable replacement for Vic Sage. Greg Rucka's characterizations of Tot and Renee fencing with philosophical quotes underscored the deeper philosophical underpinnings of their shared mission.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce52b660ffe04c1d5cebefbb82fbf775e2f84e01","amp;dn":"The+Question+-+Renee+Montoya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce52b660ffe04c1d5cebefbb82fbf775e2f84e01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,82,182,96,255,224,76,29,92,235,239,187,130,251,247,117,226,248,78,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
