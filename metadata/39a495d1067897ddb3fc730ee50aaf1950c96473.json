The band has sold an estimated 20 million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as &quot;gearheads.&quot;[1] Many of their songs, including &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, &quot;You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet&quot;, and &quot;Takin' Care of Business&quot;, receive frequent play on many FM classic rock stations.\n\nThe Bachman family name is pronounced /Ãƒâ€¹Ã‹â€ bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦kmÃƒâ€°Ã¢â€žÂ¢n/, and the band uses this pronunciation when referring to themselves.[2] However, a pronunciation of /Ãƒâ€¹Ã‹â€ bÃƒâ€°Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒâ€¹Ã‚ï¿½kmÃƒâ€°Ã¢â€žÂ¢n/ has become so widespread, especially on American radio, that the band no longer makes the correction, and both pronunciations have become acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest of B.T.O. 1976\n\n\n\nBest of BTO (So Far) (1976, Mercury Records) is a compilation album that contains material released on Bachman-Turner Overdrive's first five studio albums. &quot;Gimme Your Money Please,&quot; a cut from the band's 1973 debut album, was released as a single in 1976 to support this greatest hits package.\n\nA remastered version was released in 1998, titled Best Of BTO (Remastered Hits), which added the tracks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFour Wheel DriveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFree WheelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDown To The LineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Roll on Down the Highway&quot; (Robbie Bachman, C.F.
