The book is specifically designed to act as an introduction to the legal research skills of reasoning and method. It also looks at the foundations of civil liability in a way that emphasises the interrelationship of source materials, problem solving and conceptual analysis and justification.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b909fde08bb4e7480c8fa7abeda6a009ec22b35f","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2001%5D+Law+Of+Obligations+And+Legal+Remedies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b909fde08bb4e7480c8fa7abeda6a009ec22b35f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,9,253,224,139,180,231,72,12,143,167,171,237,166,160,9,236,34,179,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
