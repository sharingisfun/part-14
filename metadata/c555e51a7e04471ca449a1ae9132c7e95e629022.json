Up to 10 rockets will be required to carry equipment and the astronauts to the mothership. The 56-million-kilometre journey to and from the Red Planet could take up to three years. Will the fuel be thermo-nuclear or super-heated charged particles? Engineers must get it right the first time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or the astronauts will die.\n\nEpisode 3 Staying Alive\nThe spacecraft that will take a crew to Mars will be assembled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in space. Up to 10 rockets will be required to carry equipment and the astronauts to the mothership. The 56-million-kilometre journey to and from the Red Planet could take up to three years. Will the fuel be thermo-nuclear or super-heated charged particles? Engineers must get it right the first time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or the astronauts will die.\n\nEpisode 4 The Human Factor\nThe human spirit itself may be the Achilles heel of the Mars Mission. Mental breakdown, sexual tension, near-suicide and mutiny have already taken place on shorter space missions. The crew knows there is a 50 per cent failure rate in Mars landings.\n\nEpisode 5 Six Minutes of Terror\nThe last six minutes of the flight to Mars are the most terrifying. Only an inflatable aeroshell will protect the capsule as it enters Mars atmosphere at a temperature of 4,000?C and a speed of 16,000 km/hr. After the capsuleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s speed has been slowed, the astronauts have 90 seconds to pinpoint a safe place to land.\n\nEpisode 6 Search for Life\nIs there life on Mars? Scientists in North America are combing the most barren places on Earth to search out bacteria, amino acids or carbonates that might offer clues. What if Mars has its own independently created life forms which are deadly to humans? Researchers on the ArcticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s frigid Devon Island, British ColumbiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pavilion Lake, ChileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Atacama Desert and caves in New Mexico offer compelling chronicles.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ svenska kallas den hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r serien &quot;Resan till Mars&quot; och sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nds/sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndes pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ Kunskapskanalen sommaren 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c555e51a7e04471ca449a1ae9132c7e95e629022","amp;dn":"Discovery.Channel.Mars.Rising.6of6.HDTV.XViD.%5BEng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c555e51a7e04471ca449a1ae9132c7e95e629022","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,85,229,26,126,4,71,28,164,73,161,174,145,50,199,233,94,98,144,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
