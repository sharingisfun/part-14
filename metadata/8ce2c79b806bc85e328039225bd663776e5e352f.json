For only the second time (the first being during season 4), the entire TARDIS crew changed over the course of a single season.\n\nJanet Fielding (Tegan Jovanka) and Mark Strickson (Vislor Turlough) continue their roles as the Fifth Doctor's companions for their final season, Janet Fielding leaves in 'Resurrection of the Daleks' and Mark Strickson departs in 'Planet of Fire'. The new companion, Peri Brown, played by Nicola Bryant makes her first appearance in 'Planet of Fire'.\n\nThe Shape-shifting Android Companion Kamelion, played by Gerald Flood, makes his second and final appearance in 'Planet of Fire', though the character itself, along with other fifth Doctor's companion's who left by this story; Tegan, Nyssa, Adric, Turlough, all make illusionary cameos as the Doctor regenerates at the climax of 'The Caves of Androzani'.\n\nAnthony Ainley returns yet again in 'Planet of Fire' as the Master, which was intended to be his final appearance. Ainley, like other departed fifth Doctor companions make illusionary cameos as the Doctor regenerates.\n\nDavros makes his first appearance since 'Destiny of the Daleks' this time played by Terry Molloy.\n\nEpisodes were broadcast twice weekly on Thursday and Friday evenings, with 'Resurrection of the Daleks' broadcast on two consecutive Wednesday nights.\n\n'Resurrection of the Daleks' was planned as a standard four-parter. However, the BBC's coverage of the 1984 Winter Olympics meant that Doctor Who's normal time-slot was unavailable. Rather than delay broadcasting the story, the decision was made to produce it as a pair of double length episodes and broadcast it in the unfamiliar Wednesday time-slot.\n\n'The Caves of Androzani' was the first time since Season 4's 'The Tenth Planet' that the introduction of a new Doctor had taken place before the final serial of the season.\n\nSerials:\n\n01 - 'Warriors of the Deep' - 4 Episodes\n\n     Synopsis: Two rival power blocs are locked in a cold war. Under the sea, old adversaries of the Doctor's awaken, ready to take advantage of the tension and reclaim the planet Earth.\n\n02 - 'The Awakening' - 2 Episodes\n\n     Synopsis: The Doctor must face the villagers of Little Hodcombe, who have been influenced by the Malus, and save Tegan before she is burned as the ill-fated Queen of the May.\n\n03 - 'Frontios' - 4 Episodes\n\n     Synopsis: Its inhabitants having fled a dying Earth, the planet Frontios is mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last colony and the location of hidden dangers.\n\n04 - 'Resurrection of the Daleks' - 4 Episodes\n\n     Synopsis: Caught in a time corridor, the TARDIS gets dragged to Earth. At the other end of the corridor, a strike force plans the prison break of the man who created the ultimate evil.
