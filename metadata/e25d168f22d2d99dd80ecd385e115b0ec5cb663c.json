Early in human history, certain individuals were born who live on, unaging, undying, through the centuries and millenia. We follow them through over 2000 years, up to our time and beyond-to the promise of utopia, and to the challenge of the stars.\n\nA milestone in modern science fiction, a New York Times Notable Book on its first publication in 1989, this is one of a great writer's finest works.\n\nHugo and Nebula Award-winning Poul Anderson tells a breathtaking tale of Earth. Immortal humans take to the skies to travel to the stars and galaxies in a great space adventure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e25d168f22d2d99dd80ecd385e115b0ec5cb663c","amp;dn":"Poul+Anderson+-+The+Boat+of+a+Million+Years","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e25d168f22d2d99dd80ecd385e115b0ec5cb663c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,93,22,143,34,210,217,157,216,14,205,56,94,17,91,14,197,203,102,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
