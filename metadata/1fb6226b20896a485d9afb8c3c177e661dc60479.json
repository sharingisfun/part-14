It's easy to learn but very tough to master. Your job is simple: get each train to a goal station. Red trains go to red stations, blue trains go to blue stations, etc.\n\nYou control the trains by drawing track for them to follow. There isn't a time limit or even a score; the only thing you need to do is figure out a solution for each puzzle.\n\nThe first few puzzles are almost too easy, but as the difficulty increases you'll be thankful that you were able to practice the fundamentals of drawing track. \n\nAs the game progresses, you'll have to use colour theory to combine trains of different colours, use timing to merge and split trains, and use every inch of your brain in your quest to beat the game.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n1.5 - Fixed crash for users with Android 4.2, Jelly Bean\n1.4 - Frame rate performance improvement\n1.3 - Fixed bug which caused players to lose their progress (sorry about that! your progress should be restored after this update; it only affects those that updated from 1.1 to 1.2)\n1.2 - Fixed display issues with some devices &amp; Minor bug fixes\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.trainyard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.trainyard&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fb6226b20896a485d9afb8c3c177e661dc60479","amp;dn":"Trainyard+v1.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fb6226b20896a485d9afb8c3c177e661dc60479","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,182,34,107,32,137,106,72,93,154,251,140,60,23,126,102,29,198,4,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
