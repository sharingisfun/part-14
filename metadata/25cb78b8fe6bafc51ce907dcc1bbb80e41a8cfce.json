To say it was &quot;against the law&quot; to martyr for God in China would be an understatement.\n\nIn a less detrimental and punishing way, it is in fact against the law to do what you and I are doing with this music.  Make no mistake about it!  But did the threat of a beheading stop those Christians in China from uplifting Christ?  Should the thread of a lesser punishment stop you and I from martyring and spreading His Word through this music which we're sharing today?  I don't believe so.\n\nI've always maintained that we're individually accountable for how far we want to go for Christ.  I would gladly die for His sake, just as He died for my sins.  and I hope the majority of you feel the same way.\n\nI remember my Pastor once preaching a sermon on the matter, where he used war as an analogy.  A battle line.  Those closest to the man in charge are far more likely to get shot down.  Killed.  Those further away, standing in the back of the attack line, are less likely to get harmed.  In a very similar way, those willing to stand up and do the right thing for the Christ will in fact be persecuted to the utmost by those against Him.\n\n2 Timothy 3:12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.  John 15:18 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.  1 Peter 3:16-17 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. For it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.\n\nSo my prayer is as it always it.  Download this music.  Share it with as many people as possible.  Be encouraged and inspired by it.  Don't let the message within the lyrics keep you from the real thing ... reading your Bibles and going to Church.  Support the artists who's music you intend on making a staple of your collections.  Purchase their music.  Pray for their ministry.  And above all else, glorify Him in all you do, including your role in this torrent today.\n\nLet's get on with the music...\n\nGospel: Aaron Neville, Brian Donald, Eddie Ruth Bradford, Donnie McClurkin, Tye Tribbett.
