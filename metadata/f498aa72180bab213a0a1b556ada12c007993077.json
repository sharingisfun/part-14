It provides a comprehensive set of controls to manipulate the character of the saturation to make it fit exactly. SDRR offers four different main modes: TUBE, DIGI, FUZZ, DESK and reacts dynamically to the input signal. Each mode has its unique crosstalk behavior, which can be switched of or exaggerated. A unique RMS level difference metering mode makes level matching an easy task. SDRR can be different things: a saturation, a compressor, an EQ, a bit-crusher, a subtle stereo widener, or simply add some movement to your tracks with the DRIFT control. Add warmth, depth and character to your tracks with SDRR. Don't forget to check out the free IVGI, which can be seen as the little brother of SDRR. It is based on the DESK mode in SDRR. Since IVGI is comparable to SDRR quality-wise, CPU-consumption wise and regarding aliasing (or better the absence of aliasing artifacts), it's a good way to also get an impression of how SDRR would perform on your system.\n\nDC8C is one of the most flexible compressors around.\nWhile making a lot of different compression styles possible, it's general nature may be described as: clear, smooth, open, distinct.\nThe main goal while designing DC8C was to get a very clean compressor action without unwanted and often almost inevitable artifacts/distortion. This way you can achieve almost invisible compression for your most demanding mastering sessions, when you want to avoid coloration.\nIf you aim for color you can choose between two saturation models.\nFrom opto style, peak compression, external side-chaining, RMS compression, Feedback, Feedforward compression (and everything in-between) to negative ratios, zero latency brick-wall limiting, from snappy transient treatment to smooth transient rounding - everything is possible.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo not make money with this software...\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n\n0TH3Rside, ST3REO, ASSiGN, AudioP2P, CHAOS, R2R, tracer, DISCOVER, STUDIO, AF CR3W, MATRiX, V.R\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthepiratebay.se - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (08).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f498aa72180bab213a0a1b556ada12c007993077","amp;dn":"Klanghelm+-+SDRR+v1.1.0+%2B+DC8C+v2.3.0+OS+X+-+SYNTHiC4TE+%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f498aa72180bab213a0a1b556ada12c007993077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,152,170,114,24,11,171,33,58,10,27,85,106,218,18,192,7,153,48,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
