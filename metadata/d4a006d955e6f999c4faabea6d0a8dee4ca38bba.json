The series is set in Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nJamie Oliver takes one step forward and two steps back as his efforts to transform the school lunch program of Huntington, West Virginia's Central City Elementary School are met with harsh criticism and resistance from the school cook, Alice Gue, plus city administrators, DJ Rod and even the school's first graders. But despite the opposition, he does successfully raise the ire of school parents with a shocking, no-nonsense display of the fat that's being fed to their children, and he's encouraged by the initiative of a few caring teachers. The Edwards family get a wake-up call when youngest son, Justin, gets a frank warning from a doctor about the long term health effects of his poor eating habits, but then Justin is encouraged by a one-on-one cooking lesson in Jamie's kitchen. After a week of ups and downs at Central City Elementary, the fate of Jamie's mission to stay on at the school lies in the hands of a few district administrators.\n\n\nRelease Date----- 27.03.2010\nRelease Size----- 349.3 Mb\nPlay Time-------- 00:42:30\nVideo------------ 624x352\nFrame Rate------- 23.976fps\nVideo Codec------ XVID\nAudio ----------- MPEG Audio \nAudio Codec------ MP3\n\n\nIPOLITAN - T h e  n e w   w o r l d   o f   k n o w l e d g e\n\nipolitan.wordpress com\n\n\nSeed and enjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4a006d955e6f999c4faabea6d0a8dee4ca38bba","amp;dn":"Jamie+Olivers+Food+Revolution+S01E02+HDTV+XviD-Ipolitan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4a006d955e6f999c4faabea6d0a8dee4ca38bba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,160,6,217,85,230,249,153,196,250,171,234,109,10,141,238,76,163,139,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
