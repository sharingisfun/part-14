This one also looks really good. Nothing bad to say about it. Should mention that 'all sizes' actually means 'all ages', of course. This is a Discworld children's book. But since it's a Terry Pratchet, Discworld children's book, it's a little bit more strange than the average children's book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:309109e06891ce6dc41b7502d7f7d0515a0c8e91","amp;dn":"Terry+Pratchett+-+Where%27s+My+Cow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"309109e06891ce6dc41b7502d7f7d0515a0c8e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,145,9,224,104,145,206,109,196,27,117,2,215,247,208,81,90,12,142,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
