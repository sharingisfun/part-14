It peaked at number one for three weeks in the United States, becoming their most successful single, and also peaked at number one for three weeks on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart. In the band's native UK, the song peaked at number 4. The recording was notable for its controversial lyrics, groundbreaking music video and a cameo appearance by Sting singing the song's falsetto introduction and backing chorus, &quot;I want my MTV&quot;. The video was also the first to be aired on MTV Europe when the network started on August 1, 1987.\n\n&quot;Money for Nothing&quot; won the Grammy for the Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with a Vocal in 1985 at the 28th annual Grammy Awards.\n\nThe music video for the song featured early computer animation illustrating the lyrics. The video was one of the first uses of computer-animated human characters and was considered groundbreaking at the time of its release. It was the second computer-generated music video shown on MTV.\n\nOriginally, Mark Knopfler was not at all enthusiastic about the concept of the music video. MTV, however, was insistent on it. Director Steve Barron, of Rushes Postproduction in London, was contacted by Warner Bros. to persuade Knopfler to relent. Describing the contrasting attitudes of Knopfler and MTV, he said:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe problem was that Mark Knopfler was very anti-videos. All he wanted to do was perform, and he thought that videos would destroy the purity of songwriters and performers. They said, &quot;Can you convince him that this is the right thing to do, because we've played this song to MTV and they think it's fantastic but they won't play it if it's him standing there playing guitar. They need a concept.&quot; \t\n\nBarron then flew to Budapest to convince Knopfler of their concept. Meeting together after a gig, Knopfler was reportedly still unimpressed, but this time his girlfriend was present and took a hand. According to Barron:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLuckily, his girlfriend said, &quot;He's absolutely right. There aren't enough interesting videos on MTV, and that sounds like a brilliant idea.&quot; Mark didn't say anything but he didn't make the call to get me out of Budapest. We just went ahead and did it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIan Pearson and Gavin Blair created the animation, using a Bosch FGS-4000 CGI system. The animators went on to found computer animation studio Mainframe Entertainment (today Rainmaker Animation), and referenced the &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; video in an episode of their ReBoot series. The video also included stage footage of Dire Straits performing, with partially rotoscoped-animation in bright neon colors, as seen on the record sleeve.\n\nThe video was awarded &quot;Video of the Year&quot; (among many other nominations) at the third annual MTV Video Music Awards in 1986.\n\nTwo other music videos are also featured within &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;. A Hungarian pop band ElsÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ Emelet and their video &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½llj Vagy LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶k&quot; is displaying as &quot;Baby, Baby&quot; by &quot;First Floor&quot;. (The name &quot;elsÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ emelet&quot; translates to &quot;first floor&quot;.) ElsÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ Emelet was extremely popular at the time in Hungary, although their videos might not have appeared on Music Television. The other is a fictional, supposed MTV video &quot;Sally&quot; by the Ian Pearson Band (Pearson was one of the animators of the video).\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abf55805ec1170aa6fa448154bb16b2f83b2ee7d","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits+-+Money+For+Nothing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abf55805ec1170aa6fa448154bb16b2f83b2ee7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,245,88,5,236,17,112,170,111,164,72,21,75,177,107,47,131,178,238,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
