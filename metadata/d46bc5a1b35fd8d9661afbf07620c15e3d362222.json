They worked on an assembly line in the bottle-cap division of the Shotz Brewery in Milwaukee. Laverne was the quick-tempered, defensive one, always afraid of getting hurt, a glib realist. Shirley was naive and trusting, a sucker for a sad story. Others in the cast included Lenny and Squiggy, the girl&amp;#039;s screwball neighbors and truck drivers at the plant; amorous Carmine, &quot;The Big Ragu&quot;; Laverne&amp;#039;s father, Frank, owner of the Pizza Bowl, a local hangout; Mrs. Babish, the sardonic landlady; and Rosie, an uppity friend. This series was a spin-off from Happy Days.&quot; http://timstvshowcase.com/l&amp;s.html \n\nAnd Laverne &amp; Shirley really was a pretty simple show - it just made you laugh. Seasons 3 and 4 found it ranking as the #1 TV show; it&amp;#039;s debut year it was ranked #3, Season #2 it ranked #2. Only when ABC started changing it&amp;#039;s time slot did it drop in the ratings. \n\nPrincipal characters are Penny Marshall (Laverne DeFazio), Cindy Williams (Shirley Feeney), Michael McKean (Leonard &quot;Lenny&quot; Kosnowski), David L. Lander (Andrew &quot;Squiggy&quot; Squigmond), Eddie Mekka (Carmine &quot;The Big Ragoo&quot; Ragusa), Phil Foster (Frank DeFazio), Betty Garrett (Edna Babbish-DeFazio), Carole Ita White (Rosie Greenbaum). \n\nApprox. for all episodes - \nDVD&gt;DivX/640x480/1026kbps/23.976fps/mp3/48KHz/stereo/104Kbps/25min/200Mb\n\nMy upload speed is ~40 kB/s, so the initial upload of this will take ~30 to 36 hours, depending on how many are downloading and the speed at which they are sharing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d46bc5a1b35fd8d9661afbf07620c15e3d362222","amp;dn":"Laverne+%26+Shirley+Season+1+Complete+DVDRip+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d46bc5a1b35fd8d9661afbf07620c15e3d362222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,107,197,161,179,95,216,217,102,26,251,240,118,32,193,94,61,54,34,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
