John Dunbar is dubbed a hero after he accidentally leads Union       \n    troops to a victory during the Civil War. He requests a position on      \n    the western frontier, but finds it deserted. He soon finds out he is     \n    not alone, but meets a wolf he dubs &quot;Two-socks&quot; and a curious Indian     \n    tribe. Dunbar quickly makes friends with the tribe, and discovers a      \n    white woman who was raised by the Indians. He gradually earns the        \n    respect of these native people, and sheds his white-man's ways.          \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
