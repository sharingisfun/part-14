The monaural album, available in multiple formats but most commonly as a two-CD set, consists of 56 songs and 13 tracks of dialogue; 30 of the songs had never been issued previously by The Beatles. It was the first official release by The Beatles of previously unissued performances since The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl in 1977, and the first containing previously unreleased songs since Let It Be in 1970.\n\nAlthough the songs were recorded ahead of broadcast, allowing for retakes and occasional overdubbing, they are essentially &quot;live in studio&quot; performances. Most of the songs are cover versions of material from the late 1950s and early 1960s, reflecting the stage set they developed before Beatlemania. Before the album's release, comprehensive collections of The Beatles' BBC performances had become available on bootlegs.\n\nThe Beatles performed for 52 BBC Radio programmes, beginning with an appearance on the series Teenager's TurnÃ¢â‚¬â€Here We Go, recorded on 7 March 1962, and ending with the special The Beatles Invite You to Take a Ticket to Ride, recorded on 26 May 1965. Forty-seven of their BBC appearances occurred in 1963 and 1964, including ten on Saturday Club, and fifteen on their own weekly series Pop Go The Beatles which began in June 1963. As The Beatles had not accumulated many original songs by this time, the majority of their BBC performances consisted of cover versions, drawing on the repertoire that they had developed for their early stage act. In total, 275 performances of 88 different songs were broadcast, of which 36 songs never appeared on their studio albums. \n\nSeveral of the programmes aired live, but most were recorded days (or occasionally weeks) ahead of the broadcast date. The BBC's studio facilities were not as advanced as those at Abbey Road, offering only monaural recording (no multitracking) and basic overdubbing; few retakes of songs could be attempted owing to time limitations. It was not the BBC's practice to archive either the session tapes or the shows' master tapes, owing to storage space and contractual restrictions. \n\nAn official Beatles BBC album was being planned as early as 1989, and it was reported that &quot;EMI was preparing an album&quot; of the BBC material by late 1991.  To supplement the archive he had partially rebuilt for The Beeb's Lost Beatles Tapes, BBC Radio producer Kevin Howlett sought out additional sources, such as tapes kept by people involved in the original sessions; others had contacted him after the series aired to inform him of their own home recordings of additional broadcasts. Remaining gaps were filled by recordings taken from available bootlegs. \n\nFrom the available recordings, the tracks for Live at the BBC were selected by longtime Beatles producer George Martin. Martin's selection criteria included both the quality of the sound and of The Beatles' performance. Of particular interest were the 36 songs that The Beatles never performed on their official releases, of which 30 were selected for the album. Three of the six omitted were from 1962 (none of the 1962 recordings were judged to be of commercial sound quality): Roy Orbison's &quot;Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)&quot;, The Coasters' arrangement of &quot;BÃƒÂ©same Mucho&quot;, and Joe Brown's &quot;A Picture of You&quot;, all with Pete Best on drums. Two others, from early 1963, also were omitted for substandard sound: Stephen Foster's &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; and Chuck Berry's &quot;I'm Talking About You&quot;. The reason for the omission of the final song of the six, Carl Perkins' &quot;Lend Me Your Comb&quot; from July 1963, was not clear as it had very good sound quality, and it was speculated that it was held back for inclusion on a later release;\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_the_BBC_%28The_Beatles_album%29#Track_listing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_the_BBC_%28The_Beatles_album%29#Track_listing&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c552a43075898162813d2f7eea94d376efa0bee3","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Live+At+The+BBC+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c552a43075898162813d2f7eea94d376efa0bee3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,82,164,48,117,137,129,98,129,61,47,126,234,148,211,118,239,160,190,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
