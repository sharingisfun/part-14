At the time, there was endless speculation about when highlights would be released, likely as a box set. The proposed set never materialized, yet most of the material was heavily bootlegged, as the producers and Ono must have suspected. Despite the bootlegs, Ono didn't agree to an official collection of unreleased Lennon material until 1998, after the Beatles' Anthology series proved a critical and commercial success. Hence, the birth of Lennon's Anthology -- a four-disc box set, comprised entirely of unreleased home recordings, demos, and outtakes, many of which have never been previously bootlegged. As it's constructed, it's more of an aural biography than a music album. All the dialogue snippets, half-finished songs, throwaways, and parodies ensure that it's never casual listening, yet that very approach creates an intriguing portrait of Lennon -- a portrait of the man, not the artist. As such, there aren't really any forgotten treasures buried on the collection, even if many of these songs and takes are either completely unheard of or legendary among collecting circles. For every small pleasure, such as the Cheap Trick-backed version of &quot;I'm Losing You,&quot; there is a small disappointment, such as how the Dylan diatribe, &quot;Serve Yourself,&quot; doesn't quite live up to its legend. Ultimately, it doesn't matter if there are no major works or revelations, just a few good alternate tracks, because Anthology goes a long way toward capturing Lennon with all of his strengths and weaknesses. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n\nCD1 - Ascot\n\n01.Working Class Hero\n02.God\n03.I Found Out\n04.Hold On\n05.Isolation\n06.Love\n07.Mother\n08.Remember\n09.Imagine (Take 1)\n10.Fortunately\n11.Baby Please Don't Go\n12.Oh My Love\n13.Jealous Guy\n14.Maggie Mae\n15.How Do You Sleep\n16.God Save Oz\n17.Do The Oz\n18.I Don't Want To Be A Soldier\n19.Give Peace A Chance\n20.Look At Me\n21.Long Lost John\n\n\nCD2 - New York City\n\n01.New York City\n02.Attica State (Live)\n03.Imagine (Live)\n04.Bring On The Lucie\n05.Woman Is The Nigger Of The World\n06.Geraldo Rivera - One To One Concert\n07.Woman Is The Nigger Of The World (Live)\n08.It's So Hard (Live)\n09.Come Together (Live)\n10.Happy Xmas\n11.Luck Of The Irish (Live)\n12.John Sinclair (Live)\n13.The David Frost Show\n14.Mind Games (I Promise)\n15.Mind Games (Make Love, Not War)\n16.One Day At A Time\n17.I Know\n18.I'm The Greatest\n19.Goodnight Vienna\n20.Jerry Lewis Telethon\n21.A Kiss Is Just A Kiss\n22.Real Love\n23.You Are Here\n\n\nCD3 - The Lost Weekend\n\n01.What You Got\n02.Nobody Loves You When You're Down And Out\n03.Whatever Gets You Through The Night (Home)\n04.Whatever Gets You Through The Night (Studio)\n05.Yesterday (Parody)\n06.Be Bop A Lula\n07.Rip It UpReady Teddy\n08.Scared\n09.Steel And Glass\n10.Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird Of Paradox)\n11.Bless You\n12.Going Down On Love\n13.Move Over Ms. L.\n14.Ain't She Sweet\n15.Slippin' And Slidin'\n16.Peggy Sue\n17.Bring It On Home To MeSend Me Some Lovin'\n18.Phil And John 1\n19.Phil And John 2\n20.Phil And John 3\n21.When In Doubt, Fuck It\n22.Be My Baby\n23.Stranger's Room\n24.Old Dirt Road\n\n\nCD4 - Dakota\n\n01.I'm Losing You\n02.Sean's Little Help\n03.Serve Yourself\n04.My Life\n05.Nobody Told Me\n06.Life Begins At 40\n07.I Don't Wanna Face It\n08.Woman\n09.Dear Yoko\n10.Watching The Wheels\n11.I'm Stepping Out\n12.Borrowed Time\n13.The Rishi Kesh Song\n14.Sean's Loud\n15.Beautiful Boy\n16.Mr. Hyde's Gone (Don't Be Afraid)\n17.Only You\n18.Grow Old With Me\n19.Dear John\n20.The Great Wok\n21.Mucho Mungo\n22.Satire 1\n23.Satire 2\n24.Satire 3\n25.Sean's In The Sky\n26.It's Real\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers... \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5516d5df6d996796cb0e92033e3e69d38d2d97b6","amp;dn":"John+Lennon+-+Anthology+Box+Set+%281998%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5516d5df6d996796cb0e92033e3e69d38d2d97b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,22,213,223,109,153,103,150,203,14,146,3,62,62,105,211,141,45,151,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
