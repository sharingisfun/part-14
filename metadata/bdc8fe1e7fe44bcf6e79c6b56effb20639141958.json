Highlights on Transnational Speedway League include the entire first side, most notably &quot;A Shogun Named Marcus&quot; and &quot;Binge and Purge.&quot; The latter song makes good fun of the ultra-macho posturings most modern metal bands are guilty of, while retaining the light/heavy contrast that has become a part of the genre. Although the material wanes in quality during the last half, Transnational Speedway League is still one of the brighter debuts to emerge in the '90s. -- Jeremy Ulrey \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.A shogun named marcus [02:52] \n 02.El jefe speaks [03:49] \n 03.Binge and purge [06:30] \n 04.12 ounce epilogue [02:50] \n 05.Bacchanal [04:12] \n 06.Milk of human kindness [04:18] \n 07.Rats [02:46] \n 08.Earthworm [04:31] \n 09.Heirloom 13 [05:34] \n 10.Walking in the great [03:43] \n shining path of monster truc \n 11.Effigy [05:09] \n ____ \n \n 46:14 min \n 73,1 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc8fe1e7fe44bcf6e79c6b56effb20639141958","amp;dn":"Clutch-Transnational_Speedway_League-%28Retail%29-1993-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc8fe1e7fe44bcf6e79c6b56effb20639141958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,200,254,30,127,228,75,207,110,121,198,181,110,255,178,6,57,20,25,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
