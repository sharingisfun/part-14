It is organized into seven chapters covering Ã¢â‚¬Å“Silent Cartoon Series,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Theatrical Sound Cartoon Series,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Full-Length Animated Features,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Animated Television Specials,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Television Cartoon Series,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Awards and Honors,Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Milestones of Animation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It also includes a bibliography and an index. The index will be useful if the readers are not certain which category the cartoon they are looking for falls into. The volume encompasses every animated cartoon exhibited theatrically or broadcast on television on more than 60 networks. The second edition (1999) ranged from 1911 to 1998, while this third edition extends coverage from 1897 to 2007. Entries provide the title of the cartoon and a description, with broadcast dates and network and a list of voices for the characters. U.S. release dates are used if a cartoon was also released overseas. Some of the entries have illustrations. There are other cartoon reference sources, such as Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age (1999) and WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Who in Animated Cartoons (2006), but this titleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unequaled coverage in scope and time will make it popular with cartoon buffs. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Designed as the ultimate cartoon fanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guide,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it will find heaviest use in the libraryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s circulating collection.\nAbout the Author\nJeff Lenburg is an acclaimed author, celebrity biographer, entertainment historian, and writer/producer.
