Crunch! A History of the Great American Potato Chip tells the story of this crispy, salty treat, from the early sales of locally made chips at corner groceries, county fairs, and cafes to the mass marketing and corporate consolidation of the modern snack food industry.\nCrunch! also uncovers a dark side of potato chip history, including a federal investigation of the snack food industry in the 1990s following widespread allegations of antitrust activity, illegal buyouts, and predatory pricing. In the wake of these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreat Potato Chip Wars,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ corporate snack divisions closed and dozens of family-owned companies went bankrupt. Yet, despite consolidation, many small chippers persist into the twenty-first century, as mom-and-pop companies and upstart ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œboutiqueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ businesses serve both new consumers and markets with strong regional loyalties.\nIllustrated with images of early snack food paraphernalia and clever packaging from the glory days of American advertising art, Crunch! is an informative tour of large and small business in America and the vicissitudes of popular tastes.\n\nBest Books for General Audiences, selected by the American Association of School Librarians, and Outstanding Book, selected by the Public Library Association","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:439696bd5b2717253c215d35a2cc347b6f96193b","amp;dn":"Crunch%21+-+A+History+of+the+Great+American+Potato+Chip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"439696bd5b2717253c215d35a2cc347b6f96193b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,150,150,189,91,39,23,37,60,33,93,53,162,204,52,123,111,150,25,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
