He is best known as founder and lead singer of the British band Ian Dury and the Blockheads, who were one of the groups of the New Wave era in the UK.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Dury&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Dury&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand New Boots And Panties\n\nFollowing Ian Dury's death, the album was remade by as a tribute album under the title Brand New Boots And Panties. Except for &quot;Billericay Dickie&quot; and &quot;My Old Man&quot;, The Blockheads played on all the tracks, with vocals provided by various others:\n\nSinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor - &quot;Wake Up and Make Love With Me&quot;\nRobbie Williams - &quot;Sweet Gene Vincent&quot;\nPaul McCartney - &quot;I'm Partial To Your Abracadabra&quot;\nMadness - &quot;My Old Man&quot;\nBilly Bragg &amp; The Blokes - &quot;Billericay Dickie&quot;\nWreckless Eric - &quot;Clevor Trever&quot;\nCerys Matthews - &quot;If I Was With A Woman&quot;\nGrant Nicholas - &quot;Blockheads&quot;\nShane MacGowan - &quot;Plaistow Patricia&quot;\nKeith Allen - &quot;Blackmail Man&quot;\n\nBilly Bragg &amp; The Blokes chose to give &quot;Billericay Dickie&quot; a more Indian feel, a style they were using on Bragg's album England, Half English, the song has subsequently been re-released on the 2006 re-issue of that album, likewise Madness' &quot;My Old Man&quot; was much more in their style than the Blockheads. SinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor chose to change the words of &quot;Wake Up and Make Love With Me&quot; so the sex of the song's narrator was a woman, Cerys Matthews did not choose to do the same with &quot;If I Was With A Woman&quot;. Wreckless Eric, for whom &quot;Clevor Trever&quot; was originally written, meanders and mumbles during the latter half of &quot;Clevor Trever&quot;, extending the song to nearly double its original length. The album's cover art is a painting of Ian Dury by Pop Artist Peter Blake, an old teacher and long time friend of Dury's.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Boots_and_Panties!!&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Boots_and_Panties!!&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
