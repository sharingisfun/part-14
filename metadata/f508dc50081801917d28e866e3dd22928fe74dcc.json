They gave her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Bullshit AwardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for sustaining poverty. TIME says she is a hero of our times, an icon for youngsters all over the world.\n\nThe film is about Vandana Shiva, Indian environmental activist and nuclear physicist, who was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1993. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a film on globalisation and patenting, on genetic engineering, bio-piracy, indigenous knowledge.\n\n\nIn this documentary, the filmmakers follow Vandana Shiva over a two-year period, from her organic farm at the foot of the Himalayas to institutions of power all over the world. Here Vandana Shiva does battle with one of her toughest opponents, Monsanto, a huge American biotech company, when they try to patent an ancient Indian strain of wheat. Together with Dalits she tries to close down a Coca-Cola plant in Kerala, in a conflict involving groundwater pollution. In this film Vandana Shiva also tackles the question of farmersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ suicide, a backlash of the globalisation.\n\nThe filmmakers describe Monsanto from the inside and arrange what proves a shaking meeting between Vandana Shiva and Barun Mitra, liberal think-tank, lobbyist and fierce critic of Vandana Shiva ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the man who gave her the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBullshit PrizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.peaholmquist.com/bullshit/about.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.peaholmquist.com/bullshit/about.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
