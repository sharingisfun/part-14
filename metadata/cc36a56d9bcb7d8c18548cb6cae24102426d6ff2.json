Unfortunately, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a blackout at the house so he joins us via RatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s phone from his dining room in the dark. Keith gives us an update on AntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s upcoming trip to L.A., we hear about a new Ebola scare, see little Beavis, and since there is no way to take phone calls (thank god), Ant reads Twitter feedback. We hear about yet another apology in the news, a teen that killed his mom, cops gone wild, and discuss race relations between cops and civilians. Ticket University helps @HummerJon get unblocked and while the power returns, the show continues outside of the studio. Ant reads a list a Nebraska school put out on how to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“gender neutral,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows us a Russian Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live LeakÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ video, tells us how Russians feel about gays, Keith chimes in to tell us a Ã¢â‚¬Å“sucking and fuckingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ cop story, and the show wraps up for the week with a little Ã¢â‚¬Å“throwback ThursdayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ action via an old commercial.
