The Liverpool Sound tops the charts in every country, except \nin Ireland, where traditional Irish music still reigns supreme! But could \nthe unthinkable happen? Could an upstart Irish band from Liverpool \nwin the All Irish Music Championship for the first time in history? \nTransplanted Irishman Jimmy McMahon (Colm Meany) and his \nmotley English crew have their hearts set on it. Meanwhile, back in \nCounty Clare, Ireland, Jimmy&amp;#039;s stalwart older brother, John Joe \n(Bernard Hill) and his feisty local band are determined to win the \ntrophy for the third year in a row. Meanwhile, Clare&amp;#039;s star fiddler, \nAnne (the radiant music icon Andrea Corr of The Corrs family band), \nchafes under her mother&amp;#039;s rules against dating - especially when her \neye lands on Teddy (Shaun Evans), Liverpool&amp;#039;s star flute player. \nThey are Ireland&amp;#039;s answer to Romeo and Juliet.\n\nThe film weaves these timeless themes of discord - star-crossed \nlovers, feuding brothers, narrow-minded parents and rebellious \nchildren - with the passion all the characters share for the music \nthey play. And, against a backdrop of amber-lit pubs, narrow streets \nand sandy shores, the visuals keep pace with toe-tapping soundtrack \nand reflect the honor and traditions at stake in the competition. \n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n?
