The geography drastically changed but little else did. Maniacs and evil had still tried to dominate those who wanted to be free. \n\nDays became weeks, weeks became months and months turned into years as he battled and vanquished the enemies of humanity in every form and shape damnation threw at him. His last victory, almost seventeen years ago, granted him peaceÃ¢â‚¬â€a peace he had courted, a peace he had soughtÃ¢â‚¬â€one he never believed he would find. \n\nThat peace is about to end; Rourke's world is threatened again by forces he never conceived of. Are they so unpredictableÃ¢â‚¬â€situations so direÃ¢â‚¬â€there is no way to &quot;plan ahead?&quot;\n\nThis is book 30 in The Survivalist series. It has been picked up by author Bob Anderson after the death of Jerry Ahern so keep a look out for new books in the series.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction | Apocalyptic &gt; Post Apocalyptic ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3d0bf302855d074e93a20027f5c9cc773d1bb97","amp;dn":"The+Inheritors+of+Earth+by+Jerry+Ahern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3d0bf302855d074e93a20027f5c9cc773d1bb97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,208,191,48,40,85,208,116,233,58,32,2,127,92,156,199,115,209,187,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
