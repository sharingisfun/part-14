In this riveting investigation, two intrepid journalists penetrate the secret world of the FSB and illustrate how the security services have evolved into a ruthless, violently powerful force that is inextricably woven into modern RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fundamental makeup, and has become more shadowy than its predecessor, the Soviet KGB.\n\n\n\nReview\n\nKirkus Reviews, July 1, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A relentless investigation that demonstrates how, with PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise, the KSB has taken its place Ã¢â‚¬Ëœat the head table of power and prestige in Russia.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWall Street Journal, September 17, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Few people are better placed than Mr. Soldatov and Ms. Borogan to write with authority on this subject. They run the website Agentura.Ru, a magpie's nest of news and analysis that presents a well-informed view of the inner workings of this secret state. Given the fates that have befallen other investigative journalists in Russia in recent years, some might fear for the authors' safety. But the publication of the &quot;The New Nobility&quot; in English is welcome; it should be essential reading for those who hold naÃƒÂ¯ve hopes about Russia's development or who pooh-pooh the fears of its neighbors.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nForeign Policy, September 17, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The authors bring hard-digging, fact-based journalism to an aspect of Russia that has been hard to document and understandÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Sober and probing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBasil and Spice, September 14, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A non-fiction book that reads like a spy thrillerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The New Nobility is an important book, well written and meticulously researched by two journalists with the right sources, both inside and outside the FSB.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSunday Times (UK), September 19, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This compelling book is a distillation of [Soldavov &amp; BoroganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] work on the website. Drawing on considerable research it describes how the KGB, for decades at the violent vanguard of the communist dictatorship, switched effortlessly after the fall of the Soviet Union, preserving the stability of the new ultra-capitalist Kremlin; same people, many of the same methods, different name and economic system.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Guardian, September 25, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Because every page in this book gainsays his claim in the most forceful fashion imaginable that democracy is now decisive in defining Russia's political directionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. It is the product of two profoundly courageous Russian journalists who are meticulous about their reportingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. It is because they are Russian and superbly professional journalists that this book offers dozens of insights that no outsider could provide.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe Guardian, October 3, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If all of this still feels too frivolous, turn to The New Nobility, an inside look at the KGB by a pair of fearless Russian journalists, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan. Charting the organisation's heyday, decline and creeping return to power, it promises to raise the hairs on your neck as effectively as Ackroyd's ghost stories.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFinancial Times, October 18, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A detailed dissection of the FSB, the heir to the KGB, which still casts a long shadow over Moscow. For more than a decade the two authors have run the website Agentura.ru, a gold mine of information on the inner workings of the security services, particularly the FSB. In a country where many journalists have been attacked or killed for speaking truth to power, their reporting has been brave.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMother Jones, November 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The New Nobility is an unnerving look at the real power behind the new Russia.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRussian Life\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“For those looking for yet more evidence that the security services are pulling the strings in modern Russia, look no further than this extraordinary new book from the fearless journalists at agentura.ru. Soldatov (who has written for Russian Life) and Borogan have compiled a history of FSB activities and operations over the past decade that paint a very vivid picture of a security service that has become RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new ruling classÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ With amazing accounts of some of the most significant security crises and counter-terrorist activities of the past decade, Soldatov and Borogan offer insights into FSB operations that have not been offered anywhere to dateÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ A must read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nIrish Times, October 30, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Impressively detailed and unsettlingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Soldatov and Borogan have done an excellent job in shining a light in some of RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darkest corners.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nMoscow Times, November 12, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Fortunately there are inquisitive and intrepid journalists like Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan to bring nuance, analysis and old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting to the subject of the revival of RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security servicesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. The authors pull no punches in their criticism of endemic corruption and incompetence in the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security forces. But they do so with a refreshing lack of hysteria, drawing conclusions from facts they were able to document and refusing to indulge in conspiracy theory.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLiterary Review, December 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This important monograph, written by a brave and talented team, is a history of the KGB (now called the FSB) over the last fifteen years.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nNew Statesman, December 6, 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Drawing on extensive investigations, the two journalists have written a gripping account of how veterans of the KGB seized control of the Russian stateÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ This book paints a chilling picture of a country dominated by a power-hungry clique. Anyone who wants to understand PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brave new Russia should read it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nFinancial World (UK), December 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A thorough and very brave examination of an organization that has a tight political, commercial and economic grip on RussiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nNew York Review of Books, January 3, 2011\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“As it has in earlier contests over leadership, the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all-powerful Federal Security Service (FSB) is bound to have a crucial part in deciding who will be the next president. (This agency made the original arrests in the Khodorkovsky case, discussed below, which has great significance for the presidential succession.) This is why The New Nobility, which explains how the FSB has evolved over the past decade into an organization with enormous political and economic influence, is such an important and timely bookÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Using anonymous sources from within the security services and the Kremlin, along with on-the-spot reporting, Soldatov and Borogan have uncovered new and significant information on the FSB and its relations with the Russian leadership.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSunday Telegraph (UK) October 2, 2011\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An authoritative and brave investigation into nefarious dealings by the Russian security service the FSB, which replaced the KGB an on which Vladimir Putin relies.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAbout the Author\nAndrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan are cofounders of the Agentura.Ru website.
