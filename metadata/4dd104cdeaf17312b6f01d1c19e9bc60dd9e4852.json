This then creates the need for more research and development to engage with these new challenges in order to preserve the reliability of these systems. This book aims to provide advanced tools, covering major aspects, for people involved with such research and development.\nSplit into two parts (the first covering the operation and control of electric power systems and the second the stability and defence of electric power systems), this book gathers together contributions from numerous well-known European specialists in academia and the electrical industry and will be an illuminating read for those involved in this field or who have some knowledge of the fundamental notions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dd104cdeaf17312b6f01d1c19e9bc60dd9e4852","amp;dn":"Electric+Power+Systems+%282009%29+-+Michel+Crappe+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dd104cdeaf17312b6f01d1c19e9bc60dd9e4852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,209,4,205,234,241,115,18,182,240,29,28,25,233,188,96,221,158,72,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
