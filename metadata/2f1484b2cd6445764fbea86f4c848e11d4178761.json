New London\nThe Supreme Court's decision in the Kelo case created a firestorm of interest in protecting property rights. Through real-life stories and solid legal analysis, this book shows why property rights are the cornerstone of liberty and how they are protected in the U.S. Constitution. It critically examines how courts and legislatures have diminished property rights and then lays out an agenda for protecting these rights in the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f1484b2cd6445764fbea86f4c848e11d4178761","amp;dn":"Timothy+Sandefur+-+Cornerstone+of+Liberty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f1484b2cd6445764fbea86f4c848e11d4178761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,20,132,178,205,100,69,118,79,190,168,111,76,132,142,17,212,23,135,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
