This second game in the Pikmin franchise improves and expands on the real-time fun offered in the first. In Pikmin 2, Captain Olimar returns to the planet he was originally stranded on, to collect trinkets for his failing company to sell back at home. A new two-character play mechanic has been added, which allows players to switch between two spacemen while collecting items. Along with the new playable character, two new Pikmin types have been included-- large hulking purple Pikmin, and small and feisty white Pikmin. Two-player co-op challenge missions and a competitive mode are also available.    \n\n\nNOTE: To play this game you need a chipped or soft modded Wii.\n\nTo install &amp; play off disc:\n1.
