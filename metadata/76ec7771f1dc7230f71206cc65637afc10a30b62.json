With special access and a unique perspective, Melanie Perkins,\nAndy's childhood friend, re-examines the day of his disappearance 30 years ago,\nreviews the police investigation and uncovers new and startling information,\nprompting the long-&quot;cold&quot; case to be reactivated. Through interviews with other\nkids from the neighborhood, Andy's family, local and state police officers and\nnew forensic experts, Perkins begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together,\nultimately focusing in on the suspects in the case, who were never charged at the time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76ec7771f1dc7230f71206cc65637afc10a30b62","amp;dn":"Have.You.Seen.Andy.2003.SWESUB.DVBRip.XviD-Movieboys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76ec7771f1dc7230f71206cc65637afc10a30b62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,236,119,113,241,220,114,48,247,18,6,204,101,99,122,252,16,163,11,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
