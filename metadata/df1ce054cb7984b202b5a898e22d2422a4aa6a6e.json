The two contrarians laugh, confide and argue, in public and in private, as they journey through three cities. And the film captures it all. The result is a magnetic conflict, a character-driven narrative that sparkles cinematically with a perfect match of arresting personalities and intellectual rivalry. COLLISION is directed by prolific independent filmmaker Darren Doane (Van Morrison: To Be Born Again, The Battle For L.A., Godmoney).\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n--------\nIn May 2007, leading atheist Christopher Hitchens and Christian apologist Douglas Wilson began to argue the topic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIs Christianity Good for the World?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in a series of written exchanges published in Christianity Today. The rowdy literary bout piqued the interest of filmmaker Darren Doane, who sought out Hitchens and Wilson to pitch the idea of making a film around the debate.\n\nIn Fall 2008, Doane and crew accompanied Hitchens and Wilson on an east coast tour to promote the book compiled from their written debate titled creatively enough, Is Christianity Good for the World?. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI loved the idea of putting one of the beltwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most respected public intellectuals together with an ultra-conservative pastor from Idaho that looks like a lumberjackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, says Doane. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t write two characters more contrary. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more real than a fight between two guys who are on complete opposite sides of the fence on the most divisive issue in the world? We were ready to make a movie about two intellectual warriors at the top of their game going one-on-one. I knew it would make an amazing film.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn Christopher Hitchens, Doane found a celebrated prophet of atheism. Loud. Funny. Angry. Smart. Quick. An intimidating intellectual Goliath. Well-known for bullying and mocking believers into doubt and doubters into outright unbelief. In Douglas Wilson, Doane found the man who could provide a perfect intellectual, philosophical, and cinematic counterpoint to Hitchens' position and style. A trained philosopher and and deft debater. Big, bearded, and jolly. A pastor, a contrarian, a humorist--an unintimidated outsider, impossible to bully, capable of calling Hitchens a puritan (over a beer).\n\nIt was a collision of lives.\n\nWhat Doane didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect was how much Hitchens and Wilson would have in common and the respectful bond the new friend/foes would build through the course of the book tour. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThese guys ended up at the bar laughing, joking, drinking. There were so many things that they had in commonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, according to Doane. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpinions on history and politics. Literature and poetry. They agreed on so many things. Except on the existence of God.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\nBIOS\n----\nChristopher Hitchens (b. April 13, 1949) is a popular political journalist and the author of several books, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGod Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons EverythingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Hitchens is regarded as one of the most fundamental figures of modern atheism. A regular contributor to Vanity Fair, The Atlantic Monthly and Slate, Hitchens also appears regularly on The Daily Show, Charlie Rose, Washington Journal, and Real Time with Bill Maher. He was named one of the USÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;25 Most Influential LiberalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Forbes and one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTop 100 Public IntellectualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Foreign Policy. Hitchens lives in Washington, DC.\n\n\nDouglas Wilson (b. June 18, 1953) is a pastor of Christ Church, editor of Credenda/Agenda magazine, and a Senior Fellow at New Saint Andrews College.
