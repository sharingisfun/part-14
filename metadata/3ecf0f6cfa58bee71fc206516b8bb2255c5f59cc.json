After you see how, you'll come to understand why Darlene Nelson is hailed as the &quot;Best Covered Call Writer In America&quot;.\n\n\n    * How to recognize the different types of volatility and how it can often save you from a bad trade.\n\n\n    * Darlene will teach you three very little known but very powerful indicators that will show you exactly what the big boys are doing and if we are heading into a bull rally or a bear rally, almost the moment it happens! Imagine being able to arm yourself at the very start of every major reversal even before the general public gets wind of it. It'll be the closest thing to having your own crystal ball!\n\n\n    * Uncover the one spread strategy you need to be concerned with to make the right trades. Be careful though, as it has been our observation that many brokers often confuse this one strategy with the wrong one. Let this act as a tip off to you to know whether or not your broker is up to the job of making you money.\n\n\n    * Darlene's &quot;Let's Go Shopping&quot; criteria for picking the best stock candidates.

Market Makers are often described as those having a license to &quot;print money&quot;. They get to see exactly where both sides want to buy and sell a particular stock - which allows them to make a quick profit using that information.\n\n      It's funny how Darlene likes to use the analogy of a seagull flying up above the ocean and seeing all the fish swimming close to the surface. Then in one fell swoop the seagull dives down, scoops up the targeted fish, and heads right back up again! This is exactly what happens when Market Makers see all those stop orders waiting in the wings! They'll either &quot;dive&quot; down or &quot;soar&quot; up to prices in order to scoop up some orders and then restore prices to their realistic levels! By using Darlene's simple and unique method, you can stay one step ahead of the Market Makers and beat them at their own game!\n\n      The bigger secret is - The Market Makers are not the only ones stealing your money.\n\n    * Darlene's two proprietary formulas for:\n\n        1. figuring out how much you can expect to profit from a trade, and\n        2. how much a stock has to move in price in order for it to become profitable\n\n      A few simple calculations is all it takes to let you know if a trade is going to be a good deal or a bad one - before you place the trade!\n\n    * What the brokerage firms absolutely don't want you to know. There happen to exist a certain &quot;Banking Unit&quot; in each brokerage firm that carries with it a very, very dark secret. A secret that literally robs unsuspecting investors of billions of dollars of their own money (not profits) each year.\n\n      Blaming your broker won't help; this is such a powerful moneymaker for the firm that the big brass would not dare disclose this information to even their own brokers! * NOTE: This secret is so powerful; it's worth the cost of the two-day course!\n\n\n    * A simple yet powerful letter you absolutely must send to your broker immediately. Not doing so may result in the firm legally taking away your stock and your money.\n\n\n    * You'll learn about the &quot;SDS Policy&quot;. Including why you must only deal with firms who honor this particular policy or risk paying HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS in extra and totally unnecessary commissions for each trade that the &quot;SDS Policy&quot; applies to.\n\n\n    * How to avoid what Darlene calls &quot;Brain Freeze Trading&quot;. It's happened to the best of us, the market makes a sudden and unexpected move in the wrong direction resulting in potentially painful losses in a trade. What should you do, who should you ask? If you're like most of us, we tend to react much like a deer caught in the headlights - frozen with fear. This may have happened in the past, but not anymore! By using a simple technique you can prevent potential disaster. This technique is a &quot;portable recovery method&quot; and all it takes is a cell phone. You could be at a grocery store when you hear the news that could effect your trade, and you'll know in an instant exactly what you need to do to protect your trade.\n\n\n    * Know how to combine the strategies contained in Darlene's &quot;Stock Split Secrets&quot; with THE &quot;LIFESTYLE TRADING WITH L.E.A.P.S&quot; to really rake in the monster profits.

You will not only know what to do, but why you're doing it! At the end of the two days you will go home with the confidence of knowing EXACTLY what to do.&quot;\n\n    * Perform side-by-side case study comparisons showing you &quot;BEST&quot; to &quot;WORST&quot; case scenarios using live examples.
