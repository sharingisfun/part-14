His camera cuts\nacross the streets of Paris, via the mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tro, via TV, via the internet.\nthe trite of politicians, the noise of demonstration marches, the\npoignancy of funeral processions. via the subtle gaze of girls, and the\nmischievous gaze of M. Chat. \n\nThese cuts, put together, provide a document of the past 4 years, it's\nroots to the past, and a glimpse of its future.\n\n- to get the most out of this film it helps to know a bit about French current affairs. \n- note, out of interest, the many references to surrealists, and their cultural legacy.\n\n--------------\n\nthere is a note about the subtitles. please read before watching the film as it contains translations that would not fit as subtitles.\n\nthanks pa6sur for video\nthanks to me for subtitles\n\n--------------\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
