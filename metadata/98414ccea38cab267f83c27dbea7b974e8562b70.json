Using high-throughput genomic tools, nutrigenomics unravels the influence of micro- and macronutrients as potent dietary signals regulating metabolic pathways and unmasks how susceptible genotypes are predisposed to diet-related diseases.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98414ccea38cab267f83c27dbea7b974e8562b70","amp;dn":"Nutrition%2C+Epigenetic+Mechanisms%2C+and+Human+Disease","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98414ccea38cab267f83c27dbea7b974e8562b70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,65,76,206,163,140,171,38,127,131,194,125,190,167,185,116,232,86,43,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
