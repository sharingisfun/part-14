Leading the team is Special Agent Dwayne, aka &quot;King,&quot; a native of New Orleans who is driven by his need to do what is right. Working with Pride is Special Agent Christopher LaSalle, who plays hard but works harder, and Special Agent Meredith &quot;Merri&quot; Brody, a charismatic and tough interrogator who transferred from the Great Lakes office in search of a fresh start.
