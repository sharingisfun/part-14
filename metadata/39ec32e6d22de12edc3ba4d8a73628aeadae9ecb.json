This is where Miles turned funk into jazz, rock into soul, chaos into beauty.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Live-EvilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an amalgam of a concert recorded on December 19, 1970 at the Cellar Door in Washington, D.C. and sessions which had been recorded at Columbia's Studio B between February and June of the same year.\n\nIt sounds like what Davis had in mind when he first got into electric music and freer structures and rock rhythms. Miles and his band made full use of the word with Live-Evil. It's an awesome record; the sound of transition and complexity, fascinating and often exciting, and it grooves wonderfully. \n\n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nLive-Evil\n\n1971\n\n\n 2 CDs / 1997 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1:\n\n1.\tSivad [live]\n\n2.\tLittle Church [studio]\n\n3.\tMedley: Gemini/Double Image [studio]\n\n4.\tWhat I Say [live] \n\n5.\tNem Um Talvez [studio]\n\n\nTracklist / CD 2:\n\n1.
