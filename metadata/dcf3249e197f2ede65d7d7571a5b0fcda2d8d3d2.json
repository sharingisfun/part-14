With soft-edged vocals and a broad palette of instruments that lately includes harmonium and cello, he constructs diverse arrangements that skirt the borders of pop with beautiful, detailed atmospheres. The scope and sonic narratives of songs like &quot;A Woolgathering Exodus&quot; and &quot;Golden Grin&quot; exhibit new degrees of musicality, while the weightlessness of &quot;Brown Bess&quot; or &quot;Sweep Generator&quot; reflects the unrestrained context in which the record was produced.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcf3249e197f2ede65d7d7571a5b0fcda2d8d3d2","amp;dn":"Benoit+Pioulard+-+Temper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcf3249e197f2ede65d7d7571a5b0fcda2d8d3d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,243,36,158,25,127,46,222,101,215,215,87,26,91,15,205,162,216,211,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
