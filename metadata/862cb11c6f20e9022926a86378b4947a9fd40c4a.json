Each issue is an isolated story, but they all revolve around the lives of young people. Originally, the series was intended to focus on young people with supernatural powers -- which many of the issues indeed do -- but as the year progressed, the stories increasingly focused on people, relationships, and emotions, with the &quot;supernatural&quot; angle quietly deemphasized.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862cb11c6f20e9022926a86378b4947a9fd40c4a","amp;dn":"Demo+-+Comics+by+Brian+Wood+and+Becky+Cloonan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862cb11c6f20e9022926a86378b4947a9fd40c4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,44,177,28,111,32,233,2,41,38,168,99,120,180,148,122,159,212,12,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
