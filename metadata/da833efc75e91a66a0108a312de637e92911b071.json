Sorry). Available on newsstands only, MaximÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Salute To The Military is a fat compendium of all things Maxim, including our secret proprietary blend of women, gadgets, celebrities, action, entertainment, humor and not a little drunken ridiculousness. This mix of new content and classic stories also includes four very special shoots with some of our favorite girls, each based on a different branch of the armed forces (warning: some of the uniforms on display here may not pass muster), as well as a featured interview with Medal Of Honor recipient and Maxim Military Advisor Dakota Meyer.\n\n\n \n                   English | 124 pages | HQ PDF | 79.00 Mb\n\n\n\nCheck out My other Uploads for The Latest and Greatest Magazines of All Kind!
