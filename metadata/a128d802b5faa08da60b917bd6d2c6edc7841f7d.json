Johansen Ph.D. and Barry M. Pritzker\r\nABC-CLIO | July 2007 | ISBN-10: 1851098178 | 1423 Pages | PDF | 102 mb\r\n\r\nThe occupancy of most of North America by Europeans on a sustained basis is less than 200 years oldâ€”four consecutive human lives then, less than three now. Thus, the importance of American Indian history to the recent history of all peoples on this continent is clear. The history is written in what we call our homeland â€” many of our cities, half the constituent states in the federal union that calls itself the United States, bear names that have Native roots.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nBruce E. Johansen is Frederick W. Kayser Professor of Communication and Native American Studies at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Omaha, NE. His published works include The Native peoples of North America: A History and Global Warming in the 21st Century.\r\nBarry M. Pritzker (MA, UMass/Amherst) is director of foundation and corporate relations at Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY. His published works include ABC-CLIO's Native America Today: A Guide to Community Politics and Culture and Native Americans: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Peoples.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nVOLUME I\r\nChronological Essays\r\nIssues in American Indian History\r\nEvents in American Indian History\r\nVOLUME II\r\nCulture and American Indian History\r\nGovernments and American Indian History\r\nVOLUME III\r\nPeople and Groups in American Indian History\r\nPrimary Source Documents\r\nVOLUME IV\r\nIndian Nation Histories\r\nResources\r\n \nhttp://s22.postimg.org/yq2yx5qz5/Encyclopedia_of_American_Indian_History.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a128d802b5faa08da60b917bd6d2c6edc7841f7d","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+American+Indian+History+%284+in+1+set%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a128d802b5faa08da60b917bd6d2c6edc7841f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,40,216,2,181,250,160,141,166,11,145,123,214,210,198,237,199,132,31,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
