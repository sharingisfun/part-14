Yet somehow, this normal boy became one of the youngest people on whom Dr. Walter Freeman performed his barbaric transorbitalÃ¢â‚¬â€or ice pickÃ¢â‚¬â€lobotomy.\n\nAbandoned by his family within a year of the surgery, Howard spent his teen years in mental institutions, his twenties in jail, and his thirties in a bottle. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until he was in his forties that Howard began to pull his life together. But even as he began to live the Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ life he had been denied, Howard struggled with one question: Why?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“October 8, 1960. I gather that Mrs. Dully is perpetually talking, admonishing, correcting, and getting worked up into a spasm, whereas her husband is impatient, explosive, rather brutal, wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let the boy speak for himself, and calls him numbskull, dimwit, and other uncomplimentary names.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThere were only three people who would know the truth: Freeman, the man who performed the procedure; Lou, his cold and demanding stepmother who brought Howard to the doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention; and his father, Rodney. Of the three, only Rodney, the man who hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t intervened on his sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behalf, was still living. Time was running out. Stable and happy for the first time in decades, Howard began to search for answers. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“December 3, 1960. Mr. and Mrs. Dully have apparently decided to have Howard operated on. I suggested [they] not tell Howard anything about it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThrough his research, Howard met other lobotomy patients and their families, talked with one of FreemanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sons about his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s controversial lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, and confronted Rodney about his complicity. And, in the archive where the doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s files are stored, he finally came face to face with the truth.\n\nRevealing what happened to a child no oneÃ¢â‚¬â€not his father, not the medical community, not the stateÃ¢â‚¬â€was willing to protect, My Lobotomy exposes a shameful chapter in the history of the treatment of mental illness. Yet, ultimately, this is a powerful and moving chronicle of the life of one man. Without reticence, Howard Dully shares the story of a painfully dysfunctional childhood, a misspent youth, his struggle to claim the life that was taken from him, and his redemption.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03a74842ca5e3367325224188961c039fd333ddf","amp;dn":"Charles+Fleming+-+My+Lobotomy+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03a74842ca5e3367325224188961c039fd333ddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,167,72,66,202,94,51,103,50,82,36,24,137,97,192,57,253,51,61,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
