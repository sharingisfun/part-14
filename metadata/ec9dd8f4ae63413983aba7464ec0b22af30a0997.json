Knight\nCategory: Non-Fiction\nHardcover: 341 pages\nPublisher: Greenwood (June 8, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0313376123\nISBN-13: 978-0313376122\n\nPublisher's Summary/Promotional Info - &quot;Female action heroes, like other fictional characters, not only reveal a lot about society, but greatly influence individuals in society. It is no surprise that the gradual development and increase in the number of female action heroes coincides with societal changes and social movements, such as feminism. Nor is it a surprise that characteristics of female action heroes echo the progressive toughening of women and young girls in the media.\n\nFemale Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television brings to the forefront the historical representation of women and girls in film, television, comic books, and video games. The book includes profiles of 25 of the most popular female action heroes, arranged in alphabetical order for easy reference. Each chapter includes sections on the hero's origins, her power suit, weapons, abilities, and the villains with whom she grapples. Most significantly, each profile offers an analysis of the hero's storyÃ¢â‚¬â€and her impact on popular culture.&quot;\n\nEditorial Review from Booklist - &quot;Male action heroes are a staple in the media. Now women are starting to come to the fore as action heroes in their own right. In this title, author Knight showcases a broad spectrum of female protagonists (mainly from American culture) featured in twentieth-century mass media. The oldest, Joan of Arc, is included because of several film treatments. Among others who are discussed are Catwoman, Foxy Brown, Lara Croft, the Powerpuff Girls, and Princess Leia. In all, there are twenty-five women covered in alphabetically arranged chapters. A black-and-white image introduces each entry, which details origins of the character, creator and portrayer mini biographies, power suit and abilities, villains, analysis, and impact. A short list of further readings completes each chapter. Feminism is an ongoing undercurrent, and social issues of the day are noted. For example, Emma Peel, of the Avengers, is described as a precursor of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s liberation, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a precursor of the third generation of feminists. Most chapters include sidebars addressing associated thematic concepts or other figures (e.g., Nancy Drew, Margaret Mead, Betty Friedan). A useful overview and selective time line can be found at the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beginning, and a selected bibliography and index at the end. The writing is engaging; the content is accurate and makes good reading. A fun addition to reference collections from high school and up.&quot; --Lesley Farmer\n\nThe torrent folder contains the original PDF, an EPUB created with Calibre that has some minor strangeness (spaces between sentences, etc.) but is still readable, the cover image and generated metadata file. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec9dd8f4ae63413983aba7464ec0b22af30a0997","amp;dn":"Female+Action+Heroes+by+Gladys+L.+Knight+%5BEPUB%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec9dd8f4ae63413983aba7464ec0b22af30a0997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,157,216,244,174,99,65,57,131,171,167,70,78,192,178,42,243,10,9,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
