Nyaruko-san W - Episode 07 &quot;Dye the Pool Red with Blood&quot; \n\n\n\nNyaruko still wants Mahiro, as does Hasuta. KÃ…Â«ko wants Nyaruko, but believes both Nyaruko's and Mahiro's &quot;first time&quot; belongs to her. Yoriko (the mom) puts up with all of it and cheerfully runs the house where they all live. Mahiro just wants some sanity. He doesn't want to be the love toy of a Nyarlathotepan, Cthughan, or a shots-like Hasturan. He may or may not hold out.\n\n\n\n\nRelease date : May 26, 2013\n\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\n\n\nGenres: comedy, romance\n\n\n\nThemes:parody","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f3bd8ba84605d64f59ad3297cea724a1b981df6","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Haiyore%21+Nyaruko-san+W+-+07+%5B1080p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f3bd8ba84605d64f59ad3297cea724a1b981df6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,59,216,186,132,96,93,100,245,154,211,41,124,234,114,74,27,152,29,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
