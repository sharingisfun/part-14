Roderick is a robot who learns. He begins life looking like a toy tank, thinking like a child, and knowing nothing about human ways. But as he will discover, growing up and becoming fully human is no easy task in a world where many people seem to have little trouble giving up their humanity.\n\nThe Complete Roderick is widely considered to be the most ambitious and genius work of a novelist described by The Encyclopedia of ScienceFiction as &quot;the most formally inventive, the funniest, and very nearly the most melancholy of modern US science fiction writers.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:292a25ae77ca82318dff67a0ef1713744035a919","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Roderick+by+John+Sladek+-+ePub+%2B+Mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"292a25ae77ca82318dff67a0ef1713744035a919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,42,37,174,119,202,130,49,141,255,103,160,239,23,19,116,64,53,169,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
