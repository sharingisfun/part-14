The Texas prisoners recorded here used work songs in the same way and for the same reasons. These songs have a variety of subjects, but what they're really about is staying alive in hell. Deep River of Song African-American field recordings made for the Library of Congress from 1933 to 1946, a transformative period when black singers of the South and the Caribbean created a new musical language and thousands of brilliant songs that would captivate people throughout the world. The Alan Lomax Collection The Alan Lomax Collection gathers together the American, European, and Caribbean field recordings, world music compilations, and ballad operas of writer, folklorist, and ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992902d1b118549e6736f296e1770227e5b1be96","amp;dn":"Alan+Lomax+-+Deep+River+of+Song%2C+Big+Brazos%2C+Texas+Prison+Record","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992902d1b118549e6736f296e1770227e5b1be96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,41,2,209,177,24,84,158,103,54,242,150,225,119,2,39,229,177,190,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
