When I heard this was another groupie tell-all, I already envisioned what the story was going to be about, but I decided to give it a shot anyways. The tale is explicit, but has a completely different vibe than other rocker stories. Her story is very dark and emotionally compelling. Actually, the first half has nothing to do with rock and roll. Instead, she talks about her journal to sexual maturity, from her childhood in Iran to escaping to London, and all of the difficulties and heartbreak she experienced. She chronicles her whole life, from childhood to groupie-status, sharing her most explicit stories about her sexcapades with various rockers (all of which she names!). Maybe not a story for the more conservative types, but nevertheless a great read-- actually found myself unable to put it down. Not to mention the language is poetic and flowing, making the story easy to read and follow. Don\\'t be scared off by the title-- give it a chance, you will be pleasantly surprised!\n\n\nAuthor(s):\tRoxana Shirazi\nPublisher:\tIgniter\nDate:\t\t2011-07-15\nPages:  \t336\nFormat: \tpdf\nLanguage:\tEnglish\nISBN13: \t9780061931369\nISBN10: \t0061931365","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae535cd2787ec5153ac47e5585b30b85da0fe978","amp;dn":"+The+Last+Living+Slut+%3A++Born+in+Iran+%28non+-++fiction%29+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae535cd2787ec5153ac47e5585b30b85da0fe978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,83,92,210,120,126,197,21,58,196,126,85,133,179,11,133,218,15,233,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
