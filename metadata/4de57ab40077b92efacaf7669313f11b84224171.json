Chad Stuart (born in Windemere, England, on December 10, 1941) and Jeremy Clyde (born March 22, 1941, in Buckinghamshire, England) met while attending London's Central School of Speech and Drama. The two became fast friends, and after Stuart taught Clyde to play guitar, they formed a folk duo as well as a rock &amp; roll group, the Jerks. Because he graduated a year ahead of his bandmates, Clyde relocated to Scotland and performed with the Dundee Repertory Theatre. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifyxqw5ldfe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifyxqw5ldfe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nMusical styles were changing and threatening to leave Chad &amp; Jeremy's light, pleasant pop style behind. Distant Shores indicated that they were only beginning to come to grips with the situation: tracks like &quot;The Way You Look Tonight,&quot; &quot;Early Mornin' Rain,&quot; and &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; (done in an arrangement identical to Simon &amp; Garfunkel's) suggested they were still content to cover pre-rock pop and folk music. But they did contribute three original songs, and manager James William Guercio brought in the title tune, which became their final Top 40 hit. As a result, Distant Shores had &quot;transitional&quot; written all over it, although it wasn't clear what Chad &amp; Jeremy were making a transition to. [The 2000 edition included a number of bonus tracks, including an early reading of Bobby Goldsboro's &quot;When Your Love Has Gone.&quot;] \n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:kifwxqq0ldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:kifwxqq0ldse&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZEAS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZEAS&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
