It includes tales of living on her own at 14 (and how laundry may have saved her life), getting stuck in a gas station overhang on a cross country road trip, saying goodbye to her father in a way only he could have understood, and many more adventures and lessons that have led her to the successful, happy, and healthy place she is today. It is the first book Drew has written about her life since the age of 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: Perhaps the best audiobook that I have listened to. Be prepared for a lot of screaming ;) It feels more spoken, than read. Can be heard over and over again. Here's wishing more audiobooks from her if possible !\r\n\r\n&quot;Stolen&quot; from KAT where it seems to have been taken down. I was about to upload it and found a torrent was already present. Hence have chosen to use the existing torrent and not create a new one.\r\n\r\nThanks to kat uploader Dr. Soc.\r\n\r\nHope you like it. :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:643c9ce235db74e5e1a94779ee80c53f804bc195","amp;dn":"Wildflower+by+Drew+Barrymore+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"643c9ce235db74e5e1a94779ee80c53f804bc195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,60,156,226,53,219,116,229,225,169,71,121,238,128,197,63,128,75,193,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
