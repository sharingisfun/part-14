Featuring 15 supercharged versions of KISS classics, including &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot;, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;I Love It Loud&quot;, the CD is a virtual wet dream for fans of both of these larger-than-life bands. PRETTY BOY FLOYD founding member Kristy Majors leads the attack with his razor sharp guitar alongside vocalist Steve Summers who together breathe new life into the classic metal anthems of Gene Simmons &amp; Co.\n\n&quot;Kiss Of Death&quot; is available now on CD and will be available on vinyl later this year.\n\nFrom the very beginning, PRETTY BOY FLOYD wore their influences on their black fishnet sleeves. Even the name of their 1989 debut album for MCA Records, &quot;Leather Boyz With Electric Toyz&quot;, was a &quot;tongue-in-cheek tip of the hat to their glamorous heroes Ã¢â‚¬â€ SWEET, KISS, NEW YORK DOLLS Ã¢â‚¬â€ all the bands who believed that rock music wasn't just music; it was a show, a spectacle, a lifestyle.&quot; \n\nPretty Boy Floyd\nTitle \t\n\nKiss Of Death Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A Tribute To Kiss\nRelease Date \t\n\n3/31/2015\nLabel \t\n\nDeadline\nFormat \t\n\nAudio CD\nNumber of Discs \t\n\n1\n\nKiss Of Death&quot; track listing:\n\n01.
