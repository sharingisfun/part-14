Then, on the back of his transport of choice - a Ducati 1200 - Colin heads out on a culinary tour of some of IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beautiful food producing areas.\n\nAlong the way, Colin drops in to see the President of Ireland to get some tips on his latest plans to turn Ireland into an organic food bowl for Europe and finds out how the North of Ireland has renewed itself, particularly in the once troubled town of Derry.\n\nColin also learns to surf off the West Coast in County Clare and shows off some rusty drumming skills to a lively gathering in front of a welcoming fire and a very tolerant crowd.\n\nAfter seeing all the glory of Ireland, eating its delicious food and making new friends, there is one thing left for Colin to do. He goes to visit his old band mates to apologise for breaking up the band they started in their teens. The years melt away when he gets behind the kit in their garage studio to bang away, the grungy stylings of Medicine Man live once more.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Dates: 29-Apr &amp; 30-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c44f2d60a4fe364c4f26f155ef6a7796158c56","amp;dn":"My.Ireland.with.Colin.S01E01-E02.PDTV.x264-Hector","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c44f2d60a4fe364c4f26f155ef6a7796158c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,196,79,45,96,164,254,54,76,79,38,241,85,239,106,119,150,21,140,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
