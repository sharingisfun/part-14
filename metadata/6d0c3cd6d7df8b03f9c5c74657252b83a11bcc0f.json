Moorman. The author explains in great detail the Bible's chronology as with all else in scripture is given and preserved by the Holy Spirit.\n\nChronology gives the Bible its form, its structure, its actuality. The Bible can be tested in all points, and so in the subject before us it can be tested as regards time. Our study here presents the view that the Bible (the King James Version translated from the Masoretic and Received Texts) gives a complete, unbroken chronology of the years from the creation of Adam to the Death of Christ on the Cross. There are no gaps.\n\nThe Bible and the Bible alone gives the complete chronology of the years from the First Adam to the Last Adam (I Corinthians 15:45). The Bible is not dependent in any way upon secular chronology to &quot;fill in&quot; any supposed gaps.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Jack A. Moorman (1941- ) has written many books and a number of articles in defense of the King James Bible.\nHe graduated from Tennessee Temple Bible College in the 1960s and traveled to South Africa to begin a missionary church-planting ministry. He was there from 1968-88, counting two years he lived in England during that time. They started five churches, a Bible Institute, and a tract printing ministry.\n\nIn 1988 they moved to England, and since November 1993, he has preached in London, and carried on a tract ministry to more than fifty market areas across the city. It was during his years in South Africa that he began an earnest examination of the Bible version issue.\nHis book, Forever Settled, was one of his first volumes. He used it to teach his students at a Bible College in South Africa where he served the Lord as a missionary before going to England. He is member of the an Executive Committee of the Dean Burgon Society.\n\nDr. Moorman has written the following scholarly books defending the King James Bible and the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek Words that underlie it:\n1. Early Manuscripts, Church Fathers, and the Authorized Version (uploaded).\n2. Forever Settled.\n3. When the King James Bible Departs from the So-Called ?Majority Text\n4.
