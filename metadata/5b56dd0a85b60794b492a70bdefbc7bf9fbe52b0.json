Unlike his \n\nbrothers, jock Jake (Wesley Morgan) and bookworm Kenny, (Peter DaCunha), Pete hasn't yet \n\ndeveloped a distinct personality that sets him apart and he often feels left out. With the \n\nkids' grumpy grandfather (Bruce Dern) unexpectedly in town for Christmas, the pressure is \n\non to make the day as great as Grandpa remembers with his late wife, but the holiday is \n\nfilled with disastrous moments.\n\nJust when things can't get any worse, Pete wakes up the next day and realizes he's \n\nreliving December 25th all over again. Stuck repeating the day over and over, Pete panics, \n\nbut slowly realizes, with the help of his new friend and next door neighbor, Katie (Bailee \n\nMadison), that he can use his unique gift for good and give this Christmas day the do-over \n\nit deserves. Will Pete eventually have a holly jolly Christmas?\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nCast\nCredited cast:\n\tMolly Parker \t... \t\nPamela\nRest of cast listed alphabetically:\nRacine Bebamikawe \tRacine Bebamikawe \t... \t\nKiran\n\tPeter DaCunha \t... \t\nKenny\n\tBruce Dern \t... \t\nGrandpa\nVictoria Fodor \tVictoria Fodor \t... \t\nKatie's Mom\nJai Ganatra \tJai Ganatra \t... \t\nSammy\n\tZachary Gordon \t... \t\nPete\n\tJacob Kraemer \t... \t\nTed Bronski\n\tBailee Madison \t... \t\nKatie\n\tWesley Morgan \t... \t\nJake\nChad Racette \tChad Racette \t... \t\nPolar Bear Mascot\n\tRick Roberts \t... \t\nRonald\n\tMarshall Williams \t... \t\nMike Bronski\nW.
