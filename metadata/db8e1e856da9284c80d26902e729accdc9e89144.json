This song was originally composed by Project Green Hands but has been re-composed and arranged by Mathias Duplessy from France and Paul Jacob from India. The video for, &quot;Earth Song&quot; was shot in the sublime locales of the Himalayas&amp;#039; Mansasarovar and Mount Kailas and serves as a stark reminder of how beautiful our planet is and the need to save it\n\n&quot;Everything we have created on this planet was essentially first created in our minds. All that you see which is human work on this planet first found expression in the mind, then it got manifested in the outside world.\nA well established mind, a mind which is in a state of samyukthi, is referred to as a Kalpavriksha or wishing tree. If you organise your mind to a certain level, it, in turn, organises the whole system. Your body, your emotions, your energies, everything gets organised in that direction. If you do this you are a Kalpavriksha yourself. Anything that you wish will happen.\nOnce we are empowered with a potential like this, it is very important that our physical, emotional, mental and energy actions are controlled and properly directed. If it is not so, we become destructive, self-destructive.\nRight now, that is our problem. The technology which is supposed to make our life beautiful and easy has become the source of several problems. What should have been a boon is turning out to be a curse.\nIf life has to happen the way you think it should happen, first of all how you think and with how much focus you think, how much stability is there in your thought and how much reverberance is there in the thought process - all these will determine if your thought will become a reality or not.\nToday, modern science is proving that the whole of existence is just a reverberation of energy. It is a vibration. Similarly, your thought is also a vibration. If you generate a powerful thought and let it out, it will always manifest itself.\nTo create what you really care for, first, what you want must be well manifested in your mind. Once you can maintain a steady stream of thought without changing direction, definitely this is going to happen in your life. It will definitely manifest as a reality in your life.\nSo, either you make this human form into a Kalpavriksha or you make it into one big mess. You must be clear as to what is it that you really want. If you do not know what you want, the question of creating it doesn&amp;#039;t arise.\nWhat every human being wants is to live joyfully, he wants to live peacefully, in terms of its relationship he wants to be loving and affectionate. All that any human being is seeking for is pleasantness within himself, pleasantness around him.\nOnce your mind gets organised, the way you think is the way you feel: your emotions will get organised. Once your thought and emotion are organised, your energies will go the same way. Then your very body will get organised. Once all these four are organised in one direction, your ability to create and manifest what you want is phenomenal.\nYou have the power to create, you are the Creator, in so many ways. The whole technology of Isha Yoga is just about this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ transforming yourself from being just a piece of creation to the Creator himself. This is not in search of God, this is in search of becoming a God.\nThis is not in search of Divine, this is in search of becoming Divine.--Sadhguru ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db8e1e856da9284c80d26902e729accdc9e89144","amp;dn":"Power+to+Create+--+Sadhguru+Jaggi+Vasudev","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db8e1e856da9284c80d26902e729accdc9e89144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,142,30,133,109,169,40,76,128,210,105,2,231,41,172,205,201,232,145,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
