The music has soaring harmonies and loud guitars and dreamy synths and heavy drums and strange effects and unexpected changes-of-mind.\n\nNAO are the Scottish based trio of Sam Healy (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, synths, sax, percussion), Ben Martin (drums, percussion, programming) and Bill Walsh (bass, synth bass, vocals). They describe themselves as playing their instruments within a computerised wall of sound.\n\nGrappling Hooks is a subtle yet powerful kaleidoscope of purring electronics, atmospheric layers and hook-laden melodies. Preceded by single Drawing Maps from Memory, out on March 8th, the album proves that the praise that was heaped upon Callsigns EP was entirely justified.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94b0abe4c84408ddb5d0ebb0d76794250eb85823","amp;dn":"North+Atlantic+Oscillation+-+Grappling+Hooks+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94b0abe4c84408ddb5d0ebb0d76794250eb85823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,176,171,228,200,68,8,221,181,208,235,176,215,103,148,37,14,184,88,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
