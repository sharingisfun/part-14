S. Wolkenstein\n\nThis collection of problems is based on the International System of Units preferred today in all the fields of' science, engineering and economy. Other units can be converted to 51 units with the aid of the relevant tables given in this book. Each section is preceded by a brief introduction describing the\nfundamental laws and formulas which are used to solve the problems. The solutions to the problems and the reference data are appended at the end of the book.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by A. Troitsky and was edited by G. Leib. The book was first printed by Mir Publishers in 1971, and fourth reprint appeared in 1987. The link below is for the 1987 edition. Incidentally there is a Hindi translation of this book.\n\nPDF | OCR | Pagination | Cover | Bookmarked | 382 pp | 600 dpi | 27.4 MB|\n\n\nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\n+++++++++\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n1.
