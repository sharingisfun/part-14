Even 30 years later &quot;Toulouse Street&quot; has lost none of it's original charm and the transition to CD has served the music well. Tom Johnston, Pat Simmons and Co. wrote and recorded a batch of catchy, brilliantly performed songs that were instantly tighter and more memorable than their debut, this is the sound of an actual BAND. The musical chemistry here is astonishing and for fans who only know the band for it's hits &quot;Listen To The Music&quot;, &quot;Rockin' Down The Highway&quot; etc., the gentler, laid back vibe of the acoustic, folk-tinged numbers here will surprise many listeners. The title cut and &quot;Snakeman&quot; are of special note. This was a well deserved hit and still sounds remarkably fresh 3 decades later. This, along with 1973's &quot;The Captain And Me&quot; are two masterful albums that assure this band's place in music history.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Listen to the music                                  [04:49]\n02.Rockin' down the highway                             [03:24]\n03.Mamaloi                                              [02:31]\n04.Toulouse street                                      [03:22]\n05.Cotton mouth                                         [03:43]\n06.Don't start me to talkin'                            [02:45]\nis just alright                                [04:36]\n08.White sun                                            [02:32]\n09.Disciple                                             [06:45]\n10.Snake man                                            [01:36]\n________\n36:03 min\n 56,3 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
