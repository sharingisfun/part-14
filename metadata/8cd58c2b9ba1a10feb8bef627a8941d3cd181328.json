Scientific names are linked to common ones for clarity, while descriptions contain insightful details regarding plant origins, habitats, and cultivation requirements. The straightforward yet engaging writing style, along with a profusion of telling photographs depicting leaf shapes, showy flowers, and tree forms, will help in identification as well as in selecting plants to grow, whether one gardens in a greenhouse, on a windowsill, or outdoors in a sun-drenched climate.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 424 pages\n# Publisher: Timber Press (September 15, 2003)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0881925853\n# ISBN-13: 978-0881925852","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd58c2b9ba1a10feb8bef627a8941d3cd181328","amp;dn":"Tropical+Flowering+Plants+-+A+Guide+to+Identification+and+Cultiv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd58c2b9ba1a10feb8bef627a8941d3cd181328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,213,140,43,155,161,161,15,235,139,239,98,122,137,65,211,205,24,19,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
