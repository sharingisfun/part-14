Not only that, make it so believable that it was entertaining - very much so, in fact. Well, surprise, surprise.This was a good picture with a very good storyline. Well done in all departments.Cagney plays the good-bad guy and Bogart, in a pre-Sam Spade role, plays the bad-bad guy.One of the interchangeable Lane sisters (in this case Rosemary)is the love interest.\n\nLong story short; somebody done somebody wrong, with fistfights and gunplay and double-crosses and all the elements that make westerns so greatly entertaining. If you haven't seen it and like good westerns, do it.There is more than enough to like here. This movie was shown on 'old reliable'TCM just the other night. I don't think it's available in any format so you'll have to wait until they show it again and tape it.\n\nNo sequel, though. One oater with two crooked mobsters is enough. And they should have issued Cagney a different hat. \n\n720x480\n128bps\nmpeg layer-3\n23 frames/second\n1109kbps\n12 bit\ndivx\nsource file - TV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:050fba968b87f980c65c4c37196e135e32385198","amp;dn":"Oklahoma+Kid+The+%28James+Gagney%2C+Humphrey+Bogart%29+%5B1939%5D+%40+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"050fba968b87f980c65c4c37196e135e32385198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,15,186,150,139,135,249,128,198,92,76,55,25,110,19,94,50,56,81,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
