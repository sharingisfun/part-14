There, student Brendan Frye's piercing intelligence spares no one. Brendan is not afraid to back up his words with actions, and knows all the angles; yet he prefers to stay an outsider, and does - until the day that his ex-girlfriend, Emily reaches out to him unexpectedly and then vanishes. Brendan's feelings for her still run deep; so much so, that he becomes consumed with finding his troubled inamorata. To find her, Brendan enlists the aid of his only true peer, The Brain, while keeping the assistant vice principal only occasionally informed of what quickly becomes a dangerous investigation. Brendan's single-minded unearthing of students' secrets thrusts him headlong into the colliding social orbits of rich-girl sophisticate Laura, intimidating Tugger, substance-abusing Dode, seductive Kara, jock Brad and - most ominously - non-student The Pin. It is only by gaining acceptance into The Pin's closely guarded inner circle of crime and punishment that Brendan will be able to uncover hard truths about himself, Emily and the suspects that he is getting closer to.\n\n\nCast: Lukas Haas\nNora Zehetner\nMeagan Good\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt\nMatt O'Leary\nNoah Segan\nEmilie de Ravin\nNoah Fleiss\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDb Rating: 7.4\n\n\nGeneral Info:\nRelease Title: Brick (2005) 720p MKV x264 DTS BluRay-SilverTorrentHD\nGenre:  Drama | Mystery \nRelease Date: 12 May 2006 (UK) \nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nTotal Size: 3.04 GiB\nDuration: 1h 45mn\nOverall Bit rate: 4132 Kbps\nSource: Blu-Ray\n\n\nVideo Specs:\nContainer and Codec: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nFormat: MKV\nBit rate: 3282 Kbps\nResolution: 1280 x 720\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\n\n\nAudio Specs:\nAudio Codec And Type: DTS\nBitrate: 768 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 6 channels\n\nScreen Shots:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img850/7084/zwy8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img850/7084/zwy8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img405/9869/nsgv.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img405/9869/nsgv.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img7/5564/dzzl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img7/5564/dzzl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/5358/xv6t.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/5358/xv6t.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img202/9067/rbiq.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img202/9067/rbiq.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce673baf7a5fe5b63ff649ebddc94beebd96662","amp;dn":"Brick+%282005%29+720p+MKV+x264+DTS+BluRay-STHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce673baf7a5fe5b63ff649ebddc94beebd96662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,230,115,186,247,165,254,91,99,255,100,158,189,220,148,190,235,217,102,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
