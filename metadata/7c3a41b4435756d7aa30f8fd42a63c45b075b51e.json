Formed in North Wales in 2007, the band later resettled in London, where original drummer Justin Stahley was replaced by Matt Thomas. the Joy Formidable began building a buzz in 2008, making appearances at several British festivals and earning high marks from publications like The Guardian, which recommended the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;darkly joyous soft-loud racket.&quot;\n\n  After releasing several singles, the group issued the mini-album A Balloon Called Moaning in early 2009. Tours with the Editors and Passion Pit followed, and the Joy Formidable issued a live album, First You Have to Get Mad, before signing with Black Bell Records, an independent label run by Passion Pit member Ayad Al Adhamy. With Black BellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s support, A Balloon Called Moaning was released stateside in 2010. the Joy Formidable toured throughout the year and kicked off 2011 with the international release of The Big Roar, their full-length studio debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3a41b4435756d7aa30f8fd42a63c45b075b51e","amp;dn":"The+Joy+Formidable+-+Wolf%27s+Law+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3a41b4435756d7aa30f8fd42a63c45b075b51e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,58,65,180,67,87,86,215,170,48,248,253,66,166,60,69,176,117,181,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
