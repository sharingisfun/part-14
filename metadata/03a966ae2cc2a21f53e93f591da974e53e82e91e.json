Under his oppression, her soul and conscience have died while her body lives on, fulfilling his dissolute desires. She is emptyÃ¢â‚¬â€a vesselÃ¢â‚¬â€deaf to the voice of morality and blind to shame.\n\nWhen her eyes are drawn to a beautiful man for no other reason than his looks, she imagines what it would be like to escape her chains for a night by giving her body to him.\n\nBut Edward Marlow is kind and gentle when he touches her, and her subconscious whispers, this man could be her salvation. Yet how can he help her when she has secrets which prevent her freedom?\n\nEdward is restless, lonely, and a little angry with his lot in lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€it is his only excuse for being drawn to another manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mistress. The womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark hair and pale eyes are striking, and he cannot take his gaze off her while she watches him over the top of a fan with an illicit intent in her eyes.\n\nOnce heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s known her, he cannot forget her, and once heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seen the evidence of her supposed benefactorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brutality, he wants to help her. But how can he when she will not run any more than she will speak of her past?\n\nWhen a desperate Ellen finally relents and shocks Edward from his sleep, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate, he helps her flee. He just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running headlong into the secrets of her past\n\n================\n\nDovah\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03a966ae2cc2a21f53e93f591da974e53e82e91e","amp;dn":"Jane+Lark%2C+The+Passionate+Love+of+a+Rake+%28Marlow+Intriques+1+%26am","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03a966ae2cc2a21f53e93f591da974e53e82e91e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,169,102,174,44,194,162,31,83,233,63,89,29,169,116,229,62,130,233,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
