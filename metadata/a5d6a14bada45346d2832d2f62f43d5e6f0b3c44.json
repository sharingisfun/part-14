The contents of this video are designed to present the untold history of the planning and events that led to war. Topics covered include: slavery; how some blacks owned white slaves in Virginia; abolitionists, and how that movement was taken over for the purpose of pushing America into war; how the Constitution was the target and victim of the war. This video explains the European connection, and the foreign infiltration into the Confederate government itself; the tracing of a continuum of secession attempts dating back to 1804; the illegality of reconstruction and the creation of the 14th Amendment Citizenship hoax; and everything needed to trace the roots of today's power hungry Federal Government.\n\nInterviews include: John Hurley, President of the Confederate Embassy in Washington D.C. speaks on Southern Culture. Eustice Mullens presents the evidence of the lesser known 'intrigues' that created the war. Randy Geiszler speaks on the legal ramifications of the war affecting the Constitution, Martial Law and the 13th and 14th Amendments. Professor Edward Smith covers the 'Black' issues of the war including the Northern slave industry as well as discussion of the Blacks who served in the Confederacy. Other issues covered are Secession, States Rights, Reconstruction, Carpetbaggers, the Dred Scott Decision, and much more, including biographical profiles of the Who's Who in this catalog of treason.\n\nThis video is spiced up with reenactment scenes on the battlefield and with titles and graphics that assist the viewer in getting the names and facts straight.  This is a one of a kind video documentary that covers the subjects avoided by the establishment.&quot;\n\nPlease don't complain about the quality...this is the best you'll get of a rare doc for free. And if you know what year this came out, say so, I'll add it to the info.\n\n\nVideo Info:\nThe.War.Between.The.States.DVDrip.720x540.xvid.mp3-snach.avi\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 698 MiB\nDuration                         : 2h 8mn\nOveral bit rate                  : 762 Kbps\nMovie name                       : The War Between The States &amp; The Undefeated Southern Truth\nWriting application              : MEncoder MasterSoft for Vista \n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warpoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 8mn\nBit rate                         : 620 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 540 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.053\nStream size                      : 568 MiB\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 8mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 117 MiB\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\n\nTrackers(for you to add): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.conspiracycentral.net/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.conspiracycentral.net/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVisit &amp; Join us at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.ConspiracyCentral.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.ConspiracyCentral.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d6a14bada45346d2832d2f62f43d5e6f0b3c44","amp;dn":"The+War+Between+The+States+%26+The+Undefeated+Southern+Truth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d6a14bada45346d2832d2f62f43d5e6f0b3c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,214,161,75,173,164,83,70,210,131,45,47,98,244,61,94,111,11,60,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
