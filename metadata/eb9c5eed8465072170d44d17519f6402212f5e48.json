But my guess is youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not one of them. You were born with a dream of your own. And this year, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing something about it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSomewhere along your road to adulthood, you pushed your dreams to the side. You had to pay bills. You feared taking a risk on yourself. And so you settled into an unfulfilling, perhaps even unpleasant career. If itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s any comfort, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re far from alone; 66 percent of Americans hate their jobs.\n\nBut what if someone could guide you, step-by-step, as you identify, plan, and launch your dream career - in just one year. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what Ben Arment does in his transformative coaching class, which has helped hundreds of people reinvent their lives to enjoy greater enthusiasm and fulfillment while also making a living.\n\nNow heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sharing his best insights, advice, and inspiring true stories in Dream Year. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find out how people just like you are discovering (or rediscovering) what they were truly born to do, then following a proven process to make it real. And youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet men and women such as...\n\nChuck Templeton, who created an online reservation system, OpenTable, that now serves more than thirty thousand restaurants worldwide.\n\nKatie Strandlund, who launched her own event-planning business and developed a full and deeply gratifying client list.\n\nFabien Riggall, who combined his love for film and theater into a unique experience called Secret Cinema, which has reached 120,000 people.\n\nHilary Barnett, who started a social media company that now employs several team members and creates content for national brands.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no dream too big to be beyond the power of the Dream Year process. But before you conclude that this all sounds terrifyingly risky, consider ArmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wise words:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Worst-case scenarios rarely happen. And even when they do, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not as bad as we think. In fact, what most of us call a worst-case scenario is often just a reduction in our standard of living. If it becomes as bad as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d feared, you can always get another job. You can recover your life savings. You can get your dignity back. But you can never recover what you never tried at all.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb9c5eed8465072170d44d17519f6402212f5e48","amp;dn":"Dream+Year+%28Ben+Arment%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb9c5eed8465072170d44d17519f6402212f5e48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,156,94,237,132,101,7,33,112,212,77,23,81,159,100,2,33,47,94,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
