Robertson sounds fantastic backed by the rhythm section of bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Ian Thomas (except on track 8 where drumming ace Jim Keltner steps in). Guest musicians include Steve Winwood, Tom Morello, Robert Randolph, and Trent Reznor.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f5e8e85663f499472f0958638879ee2d2304a8e","amp;dn":"Robbie+Robertson+-+How+come+Clairvoyant+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f5e8e85663f499472f0958638879ee2d2304a8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,94,142,133,102,63,73,148,114,240,149,134,56,135,158,226,210,48,74,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
