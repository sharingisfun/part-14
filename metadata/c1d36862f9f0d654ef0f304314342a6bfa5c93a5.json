The Fae are free and hunting us. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a war zone out there, and no two days are alike. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Dani OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Malley, the chaos-filled streets of Dublin are my home, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no place IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather be.\n\nDani Ã¢â‚¬Å“MegaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Malley plays by her own set of rulesÃ¢â‚¬â€and in a world overrun by Dark Fae, her biggest rule is: Do what it takes to survive. Possessing rare talents and the all-powerful Sword of Light, Dani is more than equipped for the task. In fact, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of the rare humans who can defend themselves against the Unseelie. But now, amid the pandemonium, her greatest gifts have turned into serious liabilities.\n\nDaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exÃ¢â‚¬â€œbest friend, MacKayla Lane, wants her dead, the terrifying Unseelie princes have put a price on her head, and Inspector Jayne, the head of the police force, is after her sword and will stop at nothing to get it. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, people are being mysteriously frozen to death all over the city, encased on the spot in sub-zero, icy tableaux.\n\nWhen DublinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most seductive nightclub gets blanketed in hoarfrost, Dani finds herself at the mercy of Ryodan, the clubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruthless, immortal owner. He needs her quick wit and exceptional skill to figure out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s freezing Fae and humans dead in their tracksÃ¢â‚¬â€and Ryodan will do anything to ensure her compliance.\n\nDodging bullets, fangs, and fists, Dani must strike treacherous bargains and make desperate alliances to save her beloved DublinÃ¢â‚¬â€before everything and everyone in it gets iced.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1d36862f9f0d654ef0f304314342a6bfa5c93a5","amp;dn":"Iced+by+Karen+Marie+Moning+%28Dani+O%27Malley+01%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29+%5BReq%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1d36862f9f0d654ef0f304314342a6bfa5c93a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,211,104,98,249,240,214,84,239,15,48,67,20,52,42,107,250,92,147,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
