I praise Him for all His bounties. I ask Him to increase His Grace and Generosity. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah alone, who has no partner, the One, Who Subdues, the Generous, the Forgiving. I bear witness that our leader Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, His beloved and dear one, the best of all creation. He was honoured with the Glorious Quran that has been an enduring miracle throughout the years.\nHe was also sent with his guiding Sunnah that shows the way for those who seek guidence. Our leader Muhammad has been particularized with the characteristic of eloquent and pithy speech, and simplicity and ease in the religion. May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, the other Prophets and Messengers, all if their families and the rest of the righteous.\n\nAddress: Lessons on Fasting, Taraweeh And Zakaat\nLanguage: English\nFormat: PDF\nPages:  24\nFormation : Muhammad ibn Saleh al-Othaimeen\nTranslation : Abu Maryam Ismaeel Alarcon\n\nShort Description: Lessons on Fasting, Taraweeh And zakaat: contains numerous beneficial points.
