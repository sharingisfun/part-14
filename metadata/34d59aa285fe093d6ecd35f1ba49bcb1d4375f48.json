The album was originally planned to be named Unleashed, however the plans were scrapped and The Entertainer was decided upon instead. There is no scene release available yet. But now you can have an advanced listen, I just did and I feel it's kind of good.\n\nKnown for her sunny personality, straight-talking attitude and infectious smile, Alesha's gets straight down to business on her hotly-anticipated new album. The Entertainer sees her set the bar high to maintain her place as the most exciting pop/R&amp;B artist in the country. A brilliantly assertive, widescreen pop album, The Entertainer is packed with dancefloor anthems, hook-heavy hits in the making and Alesha's distinctive deft wordplay and fearlessly powerful vocals.

The Entertainer was preceded by Alesha's recent hit single, the sassy stomping 'Drummer Boy', which made the nation sit up and take notice with its unmistakable military troop rhythm, shiny brass and synths and irresistible hook. The utterly compelling accompanying video was at one point the most watched music video in the UK on YouTube and was nominated for the MOBO Award for Best Video alongside Mark Ronson, Tinie Tempah, Tinchy Stryder and Dizzee Rascal. Alesha is also heard featuring on the Roll Deep single Take Control, and own single Radio. All three tracks will be featured on her new album.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01. Baddest Chick\n02. Radio\n03.
