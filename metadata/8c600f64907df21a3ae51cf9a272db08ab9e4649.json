This is their second studio album from 1969.\n\nSwedish psych/prog/jazz outfit rooted in the mid 1960's underground. Unusually for a band with such a name they were fronted by Polish ex-pat George Wadenius whose unique guitar style was key to their sound. The original trio format made 3 studio albums and a live album (plus contributions to a soundtrack work) before splitting up. All 3 members then joined Solar Plexus (9) (not at the same time). The reformation in the mid-1970's was more of a super-group also involving musicians from Finland.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c600f64907df21a3ae51cf9a272db08ab9e4649","amp;dn":"Made+In+Sweden+-+Snakes+In+A+Whole+%281969%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c600f64907df21a3ae51cf9a272db08ab9e4649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,96,15,100,144,125,242,26,58,229,28,249,162,114,219,8,171,158,70,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
