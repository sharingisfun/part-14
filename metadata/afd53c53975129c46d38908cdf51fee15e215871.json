However, in the early 1970s, 50 of the 183 built were fitted with the more modern electric train supply in place of steam heating boilers, and renumbered as Class 45/1. \n\nWith a top speed of 90mph (145 km/h), the Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeaksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ also worked the North Trains-Pennine route from Manchester to Liverpool, becoming a common and popular sight until HSTs and more modern units took over in the 1980s. \n\nThe BR Class 45 Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for Train Simulator is a former Iron Horse House model, which has been updated to TS2015 standard, including new scenarios and improved exterior modelling. Available in BR Blue livery, also included are BR Mk2a blue/grey passenger coaches. \n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR Class 45 Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Liverpool-Manchester route (available separately and required to play these scenarios)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afd53c53975129c46d38908cdf51fee15e215871","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+BR+Class+45+%27Peak%27+Loco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afd53c53975129c46d38908cdf51fee15e215871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,213,60,83,151,81,41,196,109,56,144,140,223,81,254,225,94,33,88,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
