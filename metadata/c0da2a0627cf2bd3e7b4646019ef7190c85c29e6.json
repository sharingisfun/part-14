Maybe it was because I was about to turn the same age my mother was when I lost her. Maybe it was because after almost twenty years of marriage my husband and I seemed to be running out of things to say to each other.\n \nBut when the anonymous online study called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Marriage in the 21st CenturyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ showed up in my inbox, I had no idea how profoundly it would change my life. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t long before I was assigned both a pseudonym (Wife 22) and a caseworker (Researcher 101). \n \nAnd, just like that, I found myself answering questions.\n \n7. Sometimes I tell him heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s snoring when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not snoring so heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll sleep in the guest room and I can have the bed all to myself.\n61. Chet Baker on the tape player. He was cutting peppers for the salad. I looked at those hands and thought, I am going to have this manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s children.\n67. To not want what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have. What you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have. What you shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have.\n32. That if we werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t careful, it was possible to forget one another.\n \nBefore the study, my life was an endless blur of school lunches and doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appointments, family dinners, budgets, and trying to discern the fastest-moving line at the grocery store. I was Alice Buckle: spouse of William and mother to Zoe and Peter, drama teacher andchatter, downloader of memories and Googler of solutions.\n \nBut these days, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m also Wife 22. And somehow, my anonymous correspondence with Researcher 101 has taken an unexpectedly personal turn. Soon, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to make a decisionÃ¢â‚¬â€one that will affect my family, my marriage, my whole life. But at the moment, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m too busy answering questions. \n \nAs it turns out, confession can be a very powerful aphrodisiac.\n\n\n[b]Seeding between midnight &amp; noon (GMT +3) so be patient.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0da2a0627cf2bd3e7b4646019ef7190c85c29e6","amp;dn":"Melanie+Gideon+-+Wife+22+%28ePub+Fiction%29+%5Bsumofmind%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0da2a0627cf2bd3e7b4646019ef7190c85c29e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,218,42,6,39,207,43,211,231,180,100,96,25,239,113,144,200,92,41,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
