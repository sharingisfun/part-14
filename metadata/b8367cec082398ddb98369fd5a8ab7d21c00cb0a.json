The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8367cec082398ddb98369fd5a8ab7d21c00cb0a","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+4+-+9.023+-+English+-+OS2DDPAK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8367cec082398ddb98369fd5a8ab7d21c00cb0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,54,124,236,8,35,152,221,185,131,105,253,90,138,183,210,28,0,203,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
