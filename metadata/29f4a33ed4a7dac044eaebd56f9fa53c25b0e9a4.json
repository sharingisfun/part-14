He was also one of the most uncompromising, and he had firm views on music and social matters. His attitude often led to volatile outbursts, and sometimes fights, but it also produced some of the greatest jazz music ever made. He is often spoken of in the same awed tones that are sometimes used when the talents of Duke Ellington are discussed, and interestingly Mingus was a great admirer of Duke's work. The high standards Mingus expected of himself, and hoped for in others, meant that, at times, he became disillusioned with the music world and he suffered bouts of depression sporadically in his life. Bouts of dizzying creativity could be followed by extended periods of inactivity. A man full of contradictions, and physically powerful, he could be moody and bullying, but his compositions could be full of humour. Ambitious but innately rebellious, he sought the power and freedom to have his own large-scale works performed, but would try to overthrow established jazz festivals. Because of this, he was never going to be as big as Ellington was in financial terms, but creatively, he was a giant.\nCharles Mingus was born in Nogales, Arizona, on 22 April 1922, in an army camp. He was brought up in the Watts district of Los Angeles, where he learned to play the trombone and the cello. He did not play the bass until he was sixteen years old, and while attending High School, he studied with Red Callender, a notable bass player and composer himself, and Herman Rheinschagen, a former New York Philharmonic bass player. One of Mingus's other main tutors was Lloyd Reese, with whom he studied composition. (Reese was closely associated with both Lionel Hampton and Louis Armstrong, and Mingus would later play with these famous individuals). Mingus was already composing by 1939, and in fact he began working professionally whilst still at High School, playing with Buddy Colette, who became well established and respected for his work on the West Coast.\nBy 1948, Mingus had worked with Barney Bigard, Lee Young, Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory, Alvino Rey and Lionel Hampton, with whom he made his recording debut. (This debut was one of Mingus's own compositions). Mingus's collaboration with Bigard, Ory and Armstrong, three of the pioneers of jazz, is of interest - although Mingus was noted for his forward looking, challenging work, the spirit of traditional New Orleans jazz was never far away. He also worked with r'n'b singers during this period, as well as often leading ensembles under the title of ,Baron Mingus', or ,Baron von Mingus'.\nMingus began gaining the attention of the public in the early 1950s when he played with Red Norvo, Tal Farlow, Billy Taylor, Stan Getz, Duke Ellington and Art Tatum. At the Massey Hall concert in Toronto, Mingus performed with Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell and Max Roach. His temperamental nature also began to come to the fore around this time. At one point, he was fired from Duke Ellington's outfit, and he made several attempts to free himself from the constraints of the music business during his career. He formed his own record label in \n1952, ,Debut Records', and founded his own Jazz Workshop repertory group. He attempted to set up an alternative to the renowned Newport Jazz Festival, and after selling Debut Records to the Fantasy label, he began the ,Charles Mingus Records' labek He also wrote an autobiography, and even spent some time working for the Post Office during a period of complete disillusionment.\nNever able to abandon music altogether though, Mingus continually re-established himself, and he toured extensively in the later years of his career. However, in 1977, he was diagnosed with .Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', and a year later was no longer able to perform, though he did continue composing. Charles Mingus died on 5 January 1979, in Cuernavaca, Mexico.\n\nTrack list:\n1 - Minor Intrusion\n2 - Thrice Upon A Theme\n3 - Stormy Weather\n4 - The Spur Of the Moment / Echonitus\n5 - Four Hands\n6 - Abstractions\n7 - What Is This Thing Called Love\nNew York City: December 1954, John LaPorta (cl)(as), Teo Macero (tsXbar), Thad Jones (except Ã¢â‚¬Å“Four HandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“EchonitusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½)(tp), Jackson Wiley (except Ã¢â‚¬Å“Four HandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and &quot;Spur Of The Moment&quot;)(cel), Charles Mingus (b), Clem DeRosa (d)\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f4a33ed4a7dac044eaebd56f9fa53c25b0e9a4","amp;dn":"Charles+Mingus+-+2006+-+Supreme+Jazz+%28SACD+24+88.2%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f4a33ed4a7dac044eaebd56f9fa53c25b0e9a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,244,163,62,212,167,218,192,68,234,235,213,111,159,165,60,37,176,233,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
