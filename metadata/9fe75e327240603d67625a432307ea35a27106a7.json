Books, booklets, individual patterns, sometimes in .pdf, sometimes in .jpg (more handy for viewing and printing) and a couple of Word documents. Collected from all over the web, edited for name consistency, duplicate pruning, extensively and lovingly photoshopped: cropped, straightened, luminosity, black and white levels, contrast and so on. Although I've put in many long days of work for this, none is my own scan so it is fitting to offer my thanks to the original uploaders, no matter how bad their scanning skills, because without them there wouldn't be any material to begin with. \nAll the files are loose (no rars) so that you can pick and choose what you like. If what you already have is not of good quality, chances are that I have repaired it, so give it a try (if it's .jpgs, download only one to check). \nYou might be interested in my other knitting and crochet torrents:\n\n\nKnitting patterns - babies and children (mega collection) &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6667034&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6667034&lt;/a&gt;\nCrochet and Knitting patterns - babies and children (mega collection) &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6667054&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6667054&lt;/a&gt;\nCrochet patterns - babies and children (collection) &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6667066&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6667066&lt;/a&gt;\nCrochet afghan (throw) mega collection &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7022179/Crochet_afghan_%28throw%29_mega_collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7022179/Crochet_afghan_%28throw%29_mega_collection&lt;/a&gt;\nCrochet bags http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7065718/Crochet_bags_patterns\nCrochet motifs http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7067166\nCrochet cardigans, jackets, coats, boleros and shrugs http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7426438\nKnit afghans http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7067277/Knit_afghans_%28throws%29__bedspreads_pattern_collection\nKnit bags and purses &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7067315&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7067315&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I can only seed at night and I'm in Europe.
