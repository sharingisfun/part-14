Formed in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England in 1979, their recorded studio output comprises fifteen albums and is generally regarded as comprising two distinct eras, delineated by the departure of original vocalist &amp; frontman Fish in late 1988 after their first four albums, and the subsequent arrival of replacement Steve Hogarth (&quot;h&quot;) in early 1989. Marillion has thus far released eleven albums with Hogarth. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd542d29fa7e9548d4964fd48ed7604f24ba0561","amp;dn":"Marillion+-+Kayleigh+%28compilation%29+-+Flac++-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd542d29fa7e9548d4964fd48ed7604f24ba0561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,84,45,41,250,126,149,72,212,150,79,212,142,215,96,79,36,186,5,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
