I enjoyed most of it, although I think it starts to fall apart in the end for the understandable reason that the writer had died without finishing it, and the artist had to make do with Ã¢â‚¬Å“conceptsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“DavidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entries in his last diaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The comic itself is a very unique, very visceral piece of work, and in telling the life story of its writer, it straddles a very delicate lineÃ¢â‚¬â€œthereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than a few passages in this book that are difficult to get through simply because of the graphic nature of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being described, that what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re seeing and reading is just so intensely sad. Cathartic work can be a chore to read if one isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t led to it by his own desire, but that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily mean this might not be up your alley. As an alternative, you could also watch the Denzel Washington movie Philadelphia or the Alan Alda television film And The Band Played On, both of which deal with a similar subject in a little less bombastic fashion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:421d939e0e4735508c4084180dc5525622f33ab4","amp;dn":"Seven+Miles+a+Second+%28Vertigo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"421d939e0e4735508c4084180dc5525622f33ab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,29,147,158,14,71,53,80,140,64,132,24,13,197,82,86,34,243,58,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
