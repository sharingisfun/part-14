These songs are great in the genre, but they are nowhere on the internet and certainly not ripped like this. I have collected and ripped the cd's myself and they are all in the best mp3 quality: 320 kbps in CBR, constant bit rate. Why upload anything less than the best? Besides, if you want less space you can always convert down to VBR or so. I prefer only this quality and the music deserves it.\n\nCd's included are:\n25th anniversary collection, The Seventies part 1 and 2 and the eighties part 1 and 2\nSoul Show Classics volumes 1 and 2\nSoul Show cd boxes volumes 1-5\n\nI appreciate comments, to see if all works ok and if you like the music! Please seed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a69f83126b3ef9303324eaccf3088f509589b2e7","amp;dn":"FERRY+MAAT+SOUL+SHOW+COLLECTION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a69f83126b3ef9303324eaccf3088f509589b2e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,159,131,18,107,62,249,48,51,36,234,204,243,8,143,80,149,137,178,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
