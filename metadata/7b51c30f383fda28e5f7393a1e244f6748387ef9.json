Now, in Life Is ShortÃ¢â‚¬â€Wear Your Party Pants, she gives you the tools you need to not only reduce feelings of tension, but also to bring joy, passion, and gusto into your life. Her techniques are a brilliant blend of old-world common sense and the most contemporary research in brain chemistry, psychology, and mind-body studies. Loretta gives you dozens of proven techniques for recognizing the ten simple truths that will lead you to an intense, happy, successful life: resilience, living in the moment, optimism, acceptance, humor, creativity, moderation, responsibility, meaning, and connection.\n\n            LorettaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wisdom evolved from her own lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€one filled with the demands of being a single mother of three; of starting her own business when she was broke; and of the wacky invasiveness of her Italian family. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like all of us: real, flawed, stressed out, and on edge. Her magic comes from an ability to not take herself too seriously, and to always shift her focus away from the self-destructive and toward the truly important things in life.\n\n            In her work, Loretta has seen tens of thousands of people who live their lives as if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sitting in a waiting room, hoping that their turn comes up next. This book will show you that life is not something to be endured, but is something to be truly appreciated. We need to remember how to access our inner abundance, which allows us to be heart-centered, joy-filled human beings.\n\n            As Loretta says: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a giftÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why they call it the present.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b51c30f383fda28e5f7393a1e244f6748387ef9","amp;dn":"LIFE+IS+SHORT%2C+WEAR+YOUR+PARTY+PANTS+-+Loretta+LaRoche","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b51c30f383fda28e5f7393a1e244f6748387ef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,81,195,15,56,63,218,40,229,247,57,58,30,36,79,103,72,56,126,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
