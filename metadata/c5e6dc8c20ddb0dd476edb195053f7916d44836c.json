Following the release of their previous album The Beatles had undertaken a momentous tour of the USA and Canada including a record breaking appearance at New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s famous Shea Stadium.\n\nFollowing a deserved holiday, the guys returned to the studios in mid October, not only to record the album but also a new single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ their first double A-side featuring ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDay TripperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe Can Work It OutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe album consisted of eleven songs by John and Paul, two by George and another with the unique writing credit of Lennon-McCartney-Starkey. The inclusion of a sitar on the song Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) also illustrated GeorgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s growing interest in Indian music and culture.\n\nRubber Soul was also the last Beatles album for which Norman Smith manned the control desk. He took his leave after six albums and eleven singles going on to produce Pink Floyd and later still to enjoy success as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“HurricaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Smith.\n\nThe front cover photograph of Rubber Soul was again taken by Robert Freeman but the way the faces appear slightly distorted on the sleeve was a result on a happy accident while the image was being projected. It is also interesting to note that the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name is absent from the front of the sleeve.\n\nThe album spent nine weeks at the album chart summit in the UK during a healthy 43 chart stay.\n\nIn the US Rubber Soul was released but despite the fact that sleeve looked similar to its UK counterpart, the track listing was different. Of the twelve tracks released on the American album only ten were common to the UK version. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Just Seen A FaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Only LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from side two of the British Help! album replaced four tracks which the US would save for a future release titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYesterday....And TodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The US ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRubber SoulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album reached # 1 in early January 1966 and stayed there for six weeks during an initial chart run of 51 weeks.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n1.
