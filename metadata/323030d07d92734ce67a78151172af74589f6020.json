Who snuffed out the good man's life with the slash of a blade on a midnight street? The local printmaster has labeled the fiend &quot;the Masker,&quot; adding fuel to a volatile mystery...while young law clerk Matthew Corbett has other obsessions in mind. Earnest and hardworking, Matthew spends his precious spare time attempting to vindicate the abuses he witnessed growing up in the Sainted John Home for Boys, at the hands of its monstrous headmaster. But Matthew's true calling lies not in avenging the past but salvaging the future -- for when the Masker claims a new victim, Matthew Saulis lured into a maze of forensic clues and heart-pounding investigation that will both test his natural penchant for detection and inflame his hunger for justice. \n\nIn the strangest twist of all, the key to unmasking the Masker may await in an asylum where the Queen of Bedlam reigns -- and only a man of Matthew's reason and empathy can unlock her secrets. From the seaport to Wall Street, from society mansions to gutters glimmering with blood spilled by a deviant, Matthew's quest will tauntingly reveal the answers he seeks -- and the chilling truths he cannot escape.\n\nENJOY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323030d07d92734ce67a78151172af74589f6020","amp;dn":"The+Queen+of+Bedlam+by+Robert+R.+McCammon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323030d07d92734ce67a78151172af74589f6020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,48,48,208,125,146,115,76,230,122,120,21,17,114,175,116,88,159,96,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
