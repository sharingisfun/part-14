She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics. For several years, she is single-minded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Finally, in 2011, it appears that her work will pay off, and a U.S. Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden. But only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0761a36b114eb57b0127830d2c7a61b8703dace7","amp;dn":"Zero+Dark+Thirty+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0761a36b114eb57b0127830d2c7a61b8703dace7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,97,163,107,17,78,181,123,1,39,131,13,44,122,97,184,112,61,172,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
