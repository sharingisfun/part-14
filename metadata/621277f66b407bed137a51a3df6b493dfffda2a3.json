The eight animation sequences are colorful, impressive, free-flowing, abstract, and often surrealistic pieces. They include the most famous of all, Paul Dukas's &quot;The Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; with Mickey Mouse as the title character battling brooms carrying endless buckets of water. Also included are J.S. Bach's &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D Minor&quot;; Tchaikovsky's &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;; dinosaurs and volcanoes in Stravinsky's &quot;Rite of Spring&quot;; the delightful &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; by Ponchielli with dancing hippos, crocodiles, ostriches, and elephants; and Mussorgsky's darkly apocalyptic &quot;Night on Bald Mountain.&quot; Written by Tim Dirks \n\n\nTitle.........: Fantasia\nRuntime.......: 124 min\nSource........: R1 DVD9 NTSC\nGenre.........: Animation/Musical/Fantasy\nIMDB..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032455/\n\n\nASPECTS:\n\n[X] NTSC [ ] PAL        [ ] DVD5 [X] DVD9\n[X] Widescreen          [ ] Anamorphic\n[ ] Letterbox           [ ] Fullscreen 1.33:1\n\nAUDiO:\n\n[X] English             [ ] Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo\n[ ] Spanish             [X] Dolby Digital 5.1\n[ ] French              [X] DTS 5.1\n\n                       \nViDEO:                  MENU:            DVD-EXTRAS:\n\n[X] Untouched           [X] Untouched    [X] Untouched\n[ ] Re-Encoded          [ ] Reauthored   [ ] Re-Encoded\n[ ] CCE Passes                           [ ] CCE Passes\n[ ] Partial Stripped                     [ ] Stripped\n\nSUBTiTLES:\n\n[X] English      [ ] Spanish      [X] French\n[ ] Other        [ ] N/A   \n\nMessage to the Downloader:\n\nI wish to firstly thank you for choosing my torrents.
