On this advanced hard bop date, the music is strictly straight-ahead without any Latin rhythms. Sandoval matches wits quite successfully with clarinetist Eddie Daniels on two songs, tenor great Michael Brecker on three (including a memorable rendition of &quot;Moment's Notice&quot;), and veteran flÃƒÂ¼gelhornist Clark Terry on a joyous &quot;Mack the Knife.&quot; In addition, Sandoval pays tribute to Woody Shaw, John Coltrane, and Dizzy Gillespie. Other highlights include the moody &quot;Streets of Desire&quot; (on which Sandoval plays piano), the racehorse tempo of &quot;Real McBop&quot; (which has an impossible but impeccably played melody chorus), and Sandoval's humorous use of the plunger mute on &quot;It Never Gets Old.&quot; All in all, this is one of Arturo Sandoval's finest recordings to date.
