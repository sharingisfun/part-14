In both phases, Sedaka, a classically trained pianist, composed the music for his hits, which he sang in a boyish tenor. And throughout, even when his performing career was at a low ebb, he served as a songwriter for other artists, resulting in a string of hits year in and year out, whether recorded by him or someone else. For himself, he wrote eight U.S. Top Ten pop hits, including the chart-toppers &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do,&quot; &quot;Laughter in the Rain,&quot; and &quot;Bad Blood.&quot; The most successful cover of one of his compositions was Captain &amp; Tennille's recording of &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together,&quot; another number one. And over the years his songs were recorded by a wide range of pop, rock, country, R&amp;B, and jazz performers including ABBA, Frankie Avalon, LaVern Baker, Shirley Bassey, Teresa Brewer, Carol Burnett, Glen Campbell, the Carpenters, Nick Carter, David Cassidy, Cher, Petula Clark, Richard Clayderman, Patsy Cline, Rosemary Clooney, Sheryl Crow, Vic Damone, Bobby Darin, John Davidson, Neil Diamond, Gloria Estefan, the 5th Dimension, the Four Seasons, Connie Francis, Crystal Gayle, Lesley Gore, the Happenings, Engelbert Humperdinck, Wanda Jackson, Jan &amp; Dean, Tom Jones, Carole King, Earl Klugh, Peggy Lee, Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials, Tony Martin, Johnny Mathis, Susannah McCorkle, Clyde McPhatter, Mandy Moore, Nana Mouskouri, Maria Muldaur, the Monkees, Jim Nabors, Wayne Newton, Jane Olivor, Donny Osmond, Patti Page, the Partridge Family, Bernadette Peters, Wilson Pickett, Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard, the Searchers, Sha Na Na, Kay Starr, John Travolta, Dinah Washington, Andy Williams, and Glenn Yarbrough, among many others.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/neil-sedaka-p3147/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/neil-sedaka-p3147/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by William Ruhlmann):\n\nWhen RCA Records launched a new series of CD and cassette compilation albums under the name All Time Greatest Hits in March 1988, its first entries were by Neil Sedaka, Harry Belafonte, and JosÃƒÂ© Feliciano. The Sedaka album is just about foolproof, at least as far as the artist's 1960s RCA recordings are concerned. Among its 14 selections are all 12 of the tracks found on the late-1962 LP Neil Sedaka Sings His Greatest Hits, the two additions being the early-1963 singles &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Let's Go Steady Again.&quot; That means 14 of Sedaka's first 15 Billboard chart singles are included (the exception being &quot;I Go Ape,&quot; which got to number 42), accounting for all of his Top 40 hits prior to the 1970s except &quot;Bad Girl,&quot; which reached number 33 late in 1963. With new digital processing for the CD era, the album's sound is excellent, making the collection a scrapbook of early-'60s pop. Sedaka is a master at doo wop-styled and light rock &amp; roll arrangements, and he sings engagingly in his light, soaring tenor, frequently double-tracked. There is nothing here of any emotional weight, despite the constant focus on teenage romantic concerns, but the songs are irresistibly catchy. One might have hoped that RCA would take advantage of the CD's greater possible length to create a collection longer than 35 minutes, and there are no annotations at all (the inside of the one-page CD booklet is blank). But it's hard to argue with the contents, which neatly encapsulate Sedaka's first hitmaking era.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-time-greatest-hits-r17642/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-time-greatest-hits-r17642/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002WAJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002WAJ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
