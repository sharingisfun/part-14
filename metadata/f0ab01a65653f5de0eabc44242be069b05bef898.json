If you are using Windows Vista, then you must run the loader as administrator (right click on it, then choose &quot;Run as administrator&quot;).\n\nThe trial resetter is only needed if you forgot to run the loader first and there is no more trial time left.\n \nImportant notes:\n\nThe loader works well, even on Vista 64 bit (it must be run as administrator).\nUnfortunately this loader is not working on Windows 7 64 bit and the game's protection detects virtual machines like Virtual PC or VMware, but in Windows 7 you can create a new partition (just by shrinking the drive) and install another version of Windows (preferably XP) and play online using the loader. You can install Windows on an USB flash drive too; just make sure it has a fast transfer speed otherwise it would be too slow.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0ab01a65653f5de0eabc44242be069b05bef898","amp;dn":"Empire+Earth+II%3A+Platinum+Edition+-+Fully+Working+Online+Multipl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0ab01a65653f5de0eabc44242be069b05bef898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,171,1,166,86,83,245,222,14,171,196,66,66,190,6,155,5,190,248,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
