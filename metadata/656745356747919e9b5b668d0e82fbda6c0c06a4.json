The slow, sneaky build of the opening title track, with \na strange distorted vocal sample providing a curious opening hook, sets the tone \nas David Gahan sings of making it through &quot;another black day&quot; while powerful \ndrums and echoing metallic pings carry the song. Black Celebration is actually \nheavier on the ballads throughout, many sung by Martin Gore -- the most per \nalbum he has yet taken lead on -- with notable dramatic beauties including \n&quot;Sometimes,&quot; with its surprise gospel choir start and rough piano sonics, and \nthe hyper-nihilistic &quot;World Full of Nothing.&quot; The various singles from the album \nremain definite highlights, such as &quot;A Question of Time,&quot; a brawling, aggressive \nnumber with a solid Gahan vocal, and the romantic/physical politics of \n&quot;Stripped,&quot; featuring particularly sharp arrangements from Alan Wilder. However, \nwith such comparatively lesser-known but equally impressive numbers as the \nquietly intense romance of &quot;Here Is the House&quot; to boast, Black Celebration is \nsolid through and through.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlack Celebration is the fifth proper studio album by Depeche Mode. Released by \nMute Records on March 17, 1986, it further cemented the darkening sound that was \ninitially hinted towards on their album Construction Time Again.\n\nBlack Celebration did not sell as well as the previous album did and none of the \nthree singles were big hits. The album is one of their darkest as well, and \nfocuses more on the band's bleak side.\n\nBlack Celebration is the Depeche Mode album that has the most songs with Martin \nGore on lead vocals: &quot;A Question of Lust&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;It Doesn't Matter Two&quot;, \n&quot;World Full of Nothing&quot; and &quot;Black Day&quot; as a bonus track. The remaining tracks \nare sung by David Gahan.\n\nThe track &quot;Fly on the Windscreen&quot; had already been released as the B-side of the \n&quot;It's Called a Heart&quot; single. The band decided to rework the song (adding new \neffects and making it more stereophonic) and released it as the &quot;Final&quot; version \non this album. It was later performed live, and given a slight hip hop edge \nduring the 1993 Devotional Tour. A recorded performance of this version is \nfeatured in the live video Devotional and a special live single of &quot;In Your \nRoom&quot;.\n\nIn 2007, Black Celebration was re-released with a bonus DVD. It was released as \na part of the third wave of re-issues (along with Construction Time Again). The \nfirst CD was remastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD \nhybrid. The bonus DVD includes the B-Sides in addition to the singles and B-\nSides for &quot;Shake the Disease&quot; and &quot;It's Called a Heart&quot;, two songs that were \nrecorded a little bit before the album and were released too early to be put on \nthe album. There are also several live versions of some of the songs from Black \nCelebration. The album is released the way it was originally intended and ends \nwith &quot;New Dress&quot; (not &quot;Black Day&quot; or &quot;But Not Tonight&quot;).\n\nLike the other re-issues, the DVD includes a documentary on the album. The title \n(seen below) is Martin paraphrasing Daniel Miller about his demos for Black \nCelebration in the film. The double-documentary discusses both The Singles 81&gt;85 \nand Black Celebration, its more challenging commercial success (especially the \nsong &quot;Stripped&quot;) and all five related singles. It also includes a plethora of \nbehind-the-scenes footage of the making of Black Celebration and the ensuing \ntour. Highlights include the band meeting The Cure, and behind the scenes \nfootage of several of the music videos. The documentary is nearly an hour.\n\nIt was released March 20, 2007 in the USA, March 26 in the UK and April 2 in the \nrest of Europe.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBLACK CELEBRATION     by Tim DiGravina\n\nAfter &quot;Blasphemous Rumours,&quot; could Depeche Mode really turn back from the dark \ntrajectory on which they'd embarked? &quot;Black Celebration,&quot; the opening track to \nthe album which shares its title, is a celebration of the band's somewhat new, \nfiercely gloomy embrace of darkness. The musical arrangement is an ode to \nedginess: icy, piercing synths that build from what sounds like the minimal \nscore to a horror film into what might pass for theme music for a nocturnal \ngathering of goblins. Indeed, in the slow racing tones that begin the song, one \nhears many similarities to Dario Argento collaborators Goblin and John \nCarpenter's score for Halloween. Simmering background sound effects suggest the \ngrowl or howl of nightmarish creatures. A dance beat arises, but with the \nincreasingly chilly synths sucking away optimism, the song doesn't necessarily \nsignal a stampede to the dance floor. David Gahan's tremulous, echoing, and \nprocessed voice is no brighter than the keyboard foundation it rises over. \nMartin Gore steps in with background vocals, eager to add a sinister, spooky \npunctuation to drive his lyrics home. That &quot;Black Celebration&quot; is actually a \nlove song is quite remarkable. Looking past Gahan's cries that there's been \nanother &quot;black day,&quot; he's calling to his lover that he wants to take him or her \n&quot;in his arms&quot; to find consolation and relief. Why not celebrate their mutual \ndisgust with the world? Why not revel in the reality that things aren't getting \nbetter? It's hard to imagine a more perfect opening to the band's fifth album \nand second foray into the shadows than &quot;Black Celebration.&quot; \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA QUESTION OF LUST     \tby Tim DiGravina\n\nOne of Martin Gore's most emotional ballads, &quot;A Question of Lust&quot; is a tender \nyet epic slice of beauty. Whenever Gore handles vocals on his own, it's a sign \nthe song will deal with stark, personal feelings. Here, Gore's voice emerges as \nif he's singing a lullaby. By the time the song concludes, he's emoting \ndesperation like a wounded gospel singer. Electronic sound effects build, tumble \napart, and rebuild around his slightly echoing voice. Ambient sound washes, \nelectronically processesed handclaps, complex racing keyboard melodies, and \nhigh-pitched synth notes paint an atmosphere of optimistic sadness. Gore sings \nof all his weaknesses, from his fragility to his crippling inhibitions to his \nconstant apologies. Each time he repeats the chorus, more emotion is revealed. \n&quot;It's a question of lust/It's a question of trust/It's a question of not letting \nwhat we've built up crumble to dust,&quot; Gore admits, that keep him and his lover \ntogether. &quot;A Question of Lust&quot; is a vital cog, if not the heart, of Black \nCelebration. It's a perfect Depeche Mode song and one of Martin Gore's most \ntouching artistic achievements. Despite the fact that he's pouring out his soul \nby nearly screaming his vocals at times, the song is as delicate as a baby's \nblanket. That he's still singing as &quot;A Question of Lust&quot; fades out is all the \nmore reason to reach for the repeat button on one's CD player. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA QUESTION OF TIME     by Tim DiGravina\n\nA poppy, throbbing industrial tale of cliques and lust, &quot;A Question of Time&quot; is \na perfect lead-in companion to &quot;Stripped&quot; on Black Celebration. David Gahan \nsings of a good-looking fifteen year old peer. It's difficult to listen to the \nsong without thinking of the sixteen-year-old protagonist of &quot;Blasphemous \nRumours,&quot; though with its fuzzy, fun dance beats and angry tone, &quot;A Question of \nTime&quot; shares more in common musically with &quot;Master and Servant&quot; and &quot;Behind the \nWheel.&quot; &quot;I've got to get to your first, before they do,&quot; he tells the object of \nhis admiration. He knows that it's just &quot;a question of time&quot; before his friend \nis &quot;stripped down&quot; and &quot;messed up&quot; by the popular kids. The song has overtones \nof exploitation when Gahan sings, &quot;I condemn them/I know my kind/What goes on in \nour minds.&quot; Gahan sings in deep, unapologetic tones. Martin Gore's higher \nbackground shout of &quot;It should be better with you&quot; adds an extra layer of \ndesperation to the song. The album version feels just slightly limp compared to \nthe live recording on 101, though the industrial chug is irresistibly catchy and \nendearing in every recorded version. &quot;A Question of Time&quot; is a perfect example \nof Depeche Mode's marriage of industrial-tinged electronic pop music with themes \nof love and lust. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSTRIPPED     by Tim DiGravina\n\nJust as &quot;People Are People&quot; helped to define Depeche Mode as a catchy \nindustrial-flavored synth act in the era of Some Great Reward, &quot;Stripped&quot; \ndefined the darker trajectory and more mature subject matter the band suddenly \nand immediately mastered. It's unlikely there's ever been a more bleak love song \nto reach the popularity of &quot;Stripped.&quot; The song's foundation is a complex blend \nof pounding bass beats, staccato electronic effects, and piercing keyboard \nnotes. A sample recorded from a motorcycle serves as a constant, ratcheting \nbackground. The ominous synth washes that commence two and a half minutes in are \nnow part of a classic, trademark sound. David Gahan's voice is processed with \necho and tremolo effects. He implores his lover: &quot;Let me see you stripped down \nto the bone; let me hear you make decisions without your television.&quot; He's \nbasically asking his significant other to strip away every affectation and to \nshun the modern world for an extremely honest and open relationship. He's asking \nfor an intense, possibly codependent union when he begs, &quot;Let me hear you crying \njust for me.&quot; Imagery relating to the film Metropolis and industrial fumes \njuxtaposes with Gahan's desire to hide in the trees and lay on the grass away \nfrom it all. &quot;Stripped&quot; is an absolute tour de force of minimalist electronic \ntones and emotions for songwriter Martin Gore. Where &quot;People Are People&quot; seemed \ncustom-geared to race up charts across the world, &quot;Stripped&quot; feels intensely \npersonal and impenetrably gloomy. The song's unrelenting sense of dread is part \nof the reason it hit a nerve in so many listeners. Many of the songs on the \nband's next album, Music for the Masses, would follow the same formula of \ndepression and emotional release. Though Depeche Mode would become more \naccomplished technically and polish its sound considerably on later releases, \n&quot;Stripped&quot; is one of the group's greatest achievements. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.
