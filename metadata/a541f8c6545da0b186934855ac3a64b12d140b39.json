That makes them eager to try another home out in the west, where they are promised that mice and cats live in peace. Unfortunately, the one making this claim is an oily con artist named Cat R. Waul who is intent on his own sinister plan. Unaware of this, the Mousekewitz's begin their journey west, while their true cat friend, Tiger, follows intent on following his girlfriend gone in the same direction.\n\n\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 905 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 11mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 759 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 11mn\nBit rate                         : 1 586 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 552 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.855\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.160\nStream size                      : 816 MiB (90%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a541f8c6545da0b186934855ac3a64b12d140b39","amp;dn":"An+American+Tail+2-Fieval+Goes+West-winker+TFRG-1337X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a541f8c6545da0b186934855ac3a64b12d140b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,65,248,198,84,93,160,177,134,147,72,85,172,58,100,177,45,20,11,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
