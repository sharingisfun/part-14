Much of the documentary is a jumble of people extemporizing about this and that, but there is no connective overview. \n\nWhat holds the film together, more or less, is the steady stream of mostly slapstick clips from early cinema ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ especially Georges MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©liÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ photographic magic tricks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ whose playful spirit found its way into Cubist paintings and drawings, especially those of Picasso. A voracious consumer of popular culture, he was first exposed to the movies in 1896, at 15, and was immediately smitten. Later Picasso became an ardent fan of Charlie Chaplin; he and the more cerebral Braque even founded a film club. Their passionate interest in new technologies extended to aviation, and they nicknamed each other Orville and Wilbur. \n\nIn 1900 Picasso attended the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fair in Paris, where he was captivated by the American dancer Loie Fuller, who wore billowing veils onto which colored light was projected. Those images, noted the art historian Bernice Rose, found their way into his seminal 1907 painting, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLes Demoiselles dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Avignon.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ There is also speculation that the images of fans and musical instruments in Cubist paintings were borrowed from the movies. The more minutely the film analyzes PicassoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s paintings, the further it drifts from its subject. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPicasso and Braque Go to the MoviesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ proceeds from the assumption that changing technology drives artistic innovation. In the language of Mr. Scorsese, a vociferous champion of cinema as a serious art form: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCubism was not a style,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was a revolution that instigated a profoundly radical change of form ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in fact a radical change of vision itself.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In his eyes, movies were the engine behind that revolution. \n\nDirected by Arne Glimcher; narrated by Martin Scorsese; director of photography, Petr Hlinomaz; edited by Sabine KrayenbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hl; produced by Mr. Glimcher, Mr. Scorsese and Robert Greenhut; released by Arthouse Films.
