Haunted by unsettling dreams. Disturbed by a growing sense of dread. Convinced that people are out to get him. A portrait of someone on the edge of a nervous breakdown? Nah. Simply a typical day for Peter Parker, as your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man must contend with a new and deadly opponent named Tracer, self-defense lessons with Captain America and some disturbing news that will change his life in a distinctly negative manner. This is the startling super-story that turns the wall-crawler's world upside down and sets the stage for the year to come! Collects Amazing Spider-Man #525-528, Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #1-4 &amp; Marvel Knights Spider-Man #19-22.\n\n------\n\nThis is the 2012 digital edition of the 2006 hardcover collection. What a weird footnote to Spidey's adventures! (Most of the fallout from this crossover was wiped away by &quot;One More Day.&quot;) All credit to G85-Empire for this release!
