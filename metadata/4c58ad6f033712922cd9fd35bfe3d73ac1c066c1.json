His findings have been fascinating students around the world as he lectures on these remarkable animal designs that cannot be explained by traditional evolution.\n\nDr. Martin himself was a traditional evolutionist, but his medical and scientific training would go through an evolution, rather a revolution when he began to study animals that challenged the scientific assumptions of his education.
