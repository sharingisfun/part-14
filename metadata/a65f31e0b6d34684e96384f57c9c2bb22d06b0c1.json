They were the Royal Society, the men who made the modern world.\n\nAt the end of the seventeenth century, sickness was divine punishment, astronomy and astrology were indistinguishable, and the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most brilliant, ambitious, and curious scientists were tormented by contradiction. They believed in angels, devils, and alchemy yet also believed that the universe followed precise mathematical laws that were as intricate and perfectly regulated as the mechanisms of a great clock.\n\nThe Clockwork Universe captures these monolithic thinkers as they wrestled with natureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most sweeping mysteries. Award-winning writer Edward Dolnick illuminates the fascinating personalities of Newton, Leibniz, Kepler, and others, and vividly animates their momentous struggle during an era when little was known and everything was newÃ¢â‚¬â€battles of will, faith, and intellect that would change the course of history itself.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
