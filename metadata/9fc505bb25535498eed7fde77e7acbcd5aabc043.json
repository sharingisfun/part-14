Unknown to them is that it is a meteorite that fell to earth. When one of the workers rams the rock (meteor) with a Cat D9 a large blue light is emitted which cause the D9 to stop running. Later when one of the workers goes to use the D9 it starts running on its own and starts killing the workers.\n  This is from an old VHS tape I turned into a DVD. Although not \\&quot;ohhhh, Ahhhhh, Jeepers, Golly\\&quot;, in the quality department. It is VERY good. Probably the best copy You will find unless it is ever released on DVD.\nAlso included a pdf file of the original story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fc505bb25535498eed7fde77e7acbcd5aabc043","amp;dn":"KillDozer+%281974+tv+movie%29+TS+file","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fc505bb25535498eed7fde77e7acbcd5aabc043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,197,5,187,37,83,84,152,238,215,253,231,126,122,203,205,90,171,192,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
