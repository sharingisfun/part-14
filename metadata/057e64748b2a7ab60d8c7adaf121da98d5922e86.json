Helen runs, miles a day, to burn off energy: she&amp;#039;s an emotional celibate. Going through the post at her shop, she finds a romantic and poetic letter between the couch cushions, unsigned, and thinks it&amp;#039;s for her. It melts her resistance to feelings, and soon she undertakes an affair with Johnny, a collegiate employee. (He sees the letter and thinks she wrote it to him; he quotes some of it, so she thinks he wrote it to her.) In the background are Helen&amp;#039;s long-time friend, George, who loves her, and her mother who abruptly left on a long trip months&amp;#039; before. Discovering who actually wrote the letter brings insight and promise. \n\nEnglish subs\n\nGeneral           : C:Work.AttachmentsThe LovelettertheLoveletter_xvid.avi\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 695 MiB for 1h 27mn 22s 283ms\n\nVideo #0          : XviD at 981 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 352 (1.727) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3 at 110 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48 KHz\nLanguage          : english\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:057e64748b2a7ab60d8c7adaf121da98d5922e86","amp;dn":"The+Loveletter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"057e64748b2a7ab60d8c7adaf121da98d5922e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,126,100,116,139,42,122,182,13,140,122,218,241,33,218,152,213,146,46,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
