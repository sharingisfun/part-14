It adopts a very forward-looking, advanced approach, placing special emphasis on the main global challenges facing scientists today, such as pathogenicity vs. commensalisms, infections in immunocompromised hosts and species speciÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½city issues.\n\nBacterial Virulence: Basic Principles, Models and Global Approaches is the second title in Wiley-Blackwell's 'Infection Biology Handbook Series'. The first is Aids and Tuberculosis: A Deadly Liaison, edited by two of the most accomplished experts in this area, Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Stefan Kaufmann at the Max-Planck Institute for infectious diseases in Berlin, Germany, and Prof. Dr. Bruce Walker, director of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard in Boston, USA.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nProfessor Sansonetti received his M.D. in 1979 from the University of Paris.
