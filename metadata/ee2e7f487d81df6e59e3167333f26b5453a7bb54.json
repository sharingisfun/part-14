Sean McCloud argues, however, that there are important themes to consider within these narratives of seemingly well-adjusted peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€who attend school, go shopping, and watch moviesÃ¢â‚¬â€who also happen to fight demons. \n\n American Possessions examines Third Wave evangelical spiritual warfare, a late twentieth-, early twenty-first century movement of evangelicals focused on banishing demons from human bodies, material objects, land, regions, political parties, and nation states.

Demons, he shows, are the central fact of life in the Third Wave imagination. \n\n McCloud provides the first book-length study of this influential movement, highlighting the important ways that it reflects and diverts from the larger, neo-liberal culture from which it originates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee2e7f487d81df6e59e3167333f26b5453a7bb54","amp;dn":"American+Possessions%3A+Fighting+Demons+%282015%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee2e7f487d81df6e59e3167333f26b5453a7bb54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,46,127,72,125,129,223,110,89,227,22,115,51,242,107,84,83,167,187,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
