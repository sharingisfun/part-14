When you long gave up on getting your fix of the high from cranking out Journey and Rainbow in the car, Risk Everything is here to make it acceptable again. The record kicks off with the powerful title-track and soon Scherer shows us just what the hype with his voice is all about. After five and a half minutes of a pure feel good rock hit, you find yourself enjoying it just a little too much. Where there are moments you feel as though youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve stumbled into the soundtrack of Flash Gordon (especially with an album cover that looks like a unicorn has thrown up on it) songs like the infectious Ã¢â‚¬ËœCold BloodedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the heartfelt Ã¢â‚¬ËœDesperate In LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ make everything feel right again.\n\n\n1 Risk Everything 5:37\n2 Chance of a Lifetime 4:54\n3 Cold Blooded 4:09\n4 Desperate in Love 4:33\n5 Thee Crescendo 5:09\n6 The Dying of the Light 4:25\n7 How Long Is a Moment 5:06\n8 Brand New Heart 4:08\n9 Broken Home 4:49\n10 Milestones 5:09\n11 Independence Day 4:25 \n\n\n\nArtist: \tPeterik/Scherer\nTitle: \tRisk Everything\nGenre: \tRock\nRelease Date: \t5 May 2015\nAttributes: \t\nCountry: \t\nLabel: \tBelle Antique\nProduct Type: \tCompact Disc\n\n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band.
