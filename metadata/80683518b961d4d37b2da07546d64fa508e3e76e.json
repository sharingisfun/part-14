Breasley shares his home with two young English girls, both former art students, Diana and Anne. In this strange mÃƒÂ©nage, David is left in no doubt about his host's views on modern abstract art. However, he is puzzled by the old man's relationship with the girls, especially when he himself is attracted to Diana.\n\nEliduc\nEliduc, the shortest tale in the book, is a translation of an old Breton folk tale in which a hero goes into exile in England, leaving his wife behind. While in exile, he falls for the daughter of a local king. The story is deliberately placed after The Ebony Tower as a clear parallel of and influence on the titular story.\n\nPoor Koko\nAn elderly writer has borrowed a country cottage from friends in London. On the first night of his stay, the house is burgled. Poor Koko tells of his encounter with the burglar.\n\nThe Enigma\nJohn Fielding, British Member of Parliament, disappears without trace. Was foul play involved, or did he fake his own disappearance? The case presents few clues for the police officer in charge of the case.\n\nThe Cloud\nA seemingly idyllic picnic in the south of France for a group of English family and friends hides deeper, troubled undercurrents.\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80683518b961d4d37b2da07546d64fa508e3e76e","amp;dn":"The+Ebony+Tower+by+John+Fowles+%7BPDF%2C+EPUB%2C+MOBI%7D+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80683518b961d4d37b2da07546d64fa508e3e76e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,104,53,24,185,97,212,211,123,45,160,117,70,214,79,165,8,227,231,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
