The goal is to experience BvS without the very different interpretation of Lex Luthor presented by Jesse Eisenberg, Zack Snyder, and the writing team of Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer. In this way, the story of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman meeting, fighting, and uniting can be viewed on their own.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a labor of love since I'm a huge fan of DC and Gotham comics in particular. While I was very familiar with Zach Snyder's directing style and had read about the many controversies regarding BvS, I was constantly taken out of the movie experience by this version of Lex Luthor. While watching BvS the first time, I kept thinking &quot;what would this movie be like without Lex?&quot; Thus, the No-Lex-Edit was born.\r\n\r\nThere were no named versions of the chapters from the Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray so custom named chapters were created for all the Blu-Ray chapter points. Also, chapters with descriptions were included for every edit that removed some material. A complete list of the chapters is included at the end of the nfo file. Note, some of the chapters overlap or occur very closely together.\r\n\r\nThe chapter format is as follows:\r\n* ChXY.0 - the .0 chapters are the original chapter points from the Blu-Ray\r\n* ChXY.Z - the .Z equals .1, .2, etc and is an edit point after that original Blu-Ray chapter ChXY.0\r\n* every .Z (.1, .2, etc) chapter has a description that starts with EDIT\r\n* please see the nfo for a chapter naming example and a complete list of the chapters\r\n\r\nBy using these EDIT chapters, you can jump to a time in the FANEDIT with the edits and see and hear how the edit flows. If you wonder what was removed, just look at the chapters in the nfo file or with MediaInfo or with your video player (e.g. PotPlayer, VLC, etc).\r\n\r\nPlease check out other DC Comics, Gotham (TV series), FANEDITS, documentaries, Rifftrax, MST3K, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.org/user/bsg4you/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eaf27fba102826dcd6f616231b14c1497aabb6a","amp;dn":"Batman+v+Superman+2016+FANEDIT+No-Lex-Edit+1080p+6ch+x264+AVC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eaf27fba102826dcd6f616231b14c1497aabb6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,175,39,251,161,2,130,109,205,111,97,98,49,177,76,20,151,170,187,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
