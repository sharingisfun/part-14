By the 13th century this revision had come to be called the versio vulgata, that is, the &quot;commonly used translation&quot;, and ultimately it became the definitive and officially promulgated Latin version of the Holy Bible in the Catholic Church.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2020269a29ef83b24b1f026489ef9b09731e4a4c","amp;dn":"Vulgate+%28+Latin+Bible+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2020269a29ef83b24b1f026489ef9b09731e4a4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,32,38,154,41,239,131,178,75,31,2,100,137,239,155,9,115,30,74,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
