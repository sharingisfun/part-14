On it, she excels with an approach mastered long ago: elegant delivery that gives extra polish to a very familiar lineup. Some might find her style frosty at times, but that will come as a relief to those who want their carolers to cut through some of the holiday treacle and create a festive, yet grown-up vibe. And Krall does show off her playful side with little, personal touches. In &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; she promises to &quot;frolic and play the Canadian way,&quot; which should draw smiles from her native land. (That'll mean toasting the holiday with Molson, eh?) Elsewhere, she ends &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; with the girlishly giddy statement, &quot;I'm just crazy about horses.&quot; WellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦can't argue with that.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nOn her first full-length Christmas album, pianist/vocalist Diana Krall delivers a smoky, sophisticated, and slightly melancholy album perfectly suited to accompany egg nog cocktails and romantic afterglow holiday affairs. Although there isn't anything unexpected on Christmas Songs -- Irving Berlin's &quot;Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep&quot; is as close to obscure as it gets -- Krall coos life into such standards as &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&quot; &quot;What Are You Doing New Year's Eve,&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas.&quot; It also doesn't hurt that she gains top-notch support from the Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra, whose urbane arrangements help bring to mind similar works by such iconic vocalists as Nat King Cole, June Christy, and Frank Sinatra. But it's not all deep sighs and bedroom eyes; on the contrary, Krall keeps things swinging with such uptempo numbers as the joyous &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; &quot;Winter Wonderland,&quot; and the Blossom Dearie-inflected &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.&quot; If you like your holiday albums cool and classy, Christmas Songs is a stocking stuffer that's sure to please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1ec9fb0a4855adaef761d8876c1b8364fa92a8","amp;dn":"Diana+Krall+-+Christmas+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb1ec9fb0a4855adaef761d8876c1b8364fa92a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,30,201,251,10,72,85,173,174,247,97,216,135,108,27,131,100,250,146,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
