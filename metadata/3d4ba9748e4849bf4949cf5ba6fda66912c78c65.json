(Would that Pinnock did more vocal pieces, his Haydn Mass is also lovely.) While I am not usually a fan of the scattershot recital approach, this one works. If you like either Von Otter (and how could you not?) or Pinnock, this disc is self-recommending.\n\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars \nA real gem on a great recording., February 27, 2007\nBy &quot;xxx&quot; (Hong Kong)\nI have to tell you how horribly upset I was to have this CD stolen from me by my friends (who dared not admit it!)\nI bought this together with Ms. Bartoli&amp;#039;s &quot;Arie Antique&quot;. I love both discs to death.\nMs. von Otter has a very different timbre from Ms. Bartoli. However, in terms of singing, both artists were at their absolute peak in those two discs.\nMy favorite song on this disc, Gluck&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Oh, del mio dolce ardor bramato oggetto&amp;#039;, though also an Italian &amp;#039;antique&amp;#039; composition, was NOT on Ms. Bartoli&amp;#039;s disc. Ms. von Otter sung it with such soul and voice that I really wonder (increasing more so these days) if Ms. Bartoli could be as good!\nI heard both their &amp;#039;Voi che sapete&amp;#039;, and must say that I preferred von Otter&amp;#039;s, though Bartoli gave an almost equally good interpretation in her own Mozart album.\nHaving reacquired this lost album recently, I would add that Ms. von Otter&amp;#039;s interpretations in the rarer Mozart operatic works are a real wonder. Compared with Ms. Fleming&amp;#039;s Mozart album wherein contained a number of Mozart&amp;#039;s rare works, the singing of Anne Sofie von Otter clearly is of a much more convincing standard. As the singer herself puts it: &amp;#039;On passionate women and moustaches&amp;#039;, undoubtedly this disc demonstrates the full musical capability of hers in both genres to a fascinatingly high standard.\n\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\nFANTASTIC!!! AN 18th CENTURY VOYAGE, April 23, 2001\nBy xxxxxxx (PANAMA CITY, Rep of Panama)\nAN EXCELLENT VOICE! AND A VERY WELL THINK REPERTORY. I REALLY HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS BEAUTIFUL CD EITHER IF YOU LIKE THE GREAT VOICE OF VON OTTER OR THE CHARMING ARIAS OF MOZART, HAYDN AND GLUCK.\n\n\nEAC ------&gt; lame mp3 encoder (3.97) @ 320 kbps vbr\n\n\nenjoy &amp; ....... seed ^^ thanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d4ba9748e4849bf4949cf5ba6fda66912c78c65","amp;dn":"Opera+Arias+-+Mozart+-+Haydn+-+Gluck+-+A.S.Von+Otter+-+Pinnock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d4ba9748e4849bf4949cf5ba6fda66912c78c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,75,169,116,142,72,73,191,73,73,207,91,166,253,166,105,18,199,140,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
