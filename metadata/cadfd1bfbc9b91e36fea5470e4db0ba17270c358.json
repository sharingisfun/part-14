It is not the &quot;official&quot; Washington story, nor is it a &quot;convenient&quot; story for many governments of the hemisphere. It is the story that the Latin American peoples have been writing to this date, in their struggle for sovereignty. The Series is a tool for that struggle, and it is also a homage to those who have fallen.\n\nA Cuban airliner with 73 passengers on board left Venezuela on October 6, 1976. Two explosions took it down over the ocean, near the Barbados coast. There were no survivors.\n\nAs a result of this attack, the existence of a terrorist network was exposed to the public opinion. A network that was financed and controlled by the CIA, and which had been operating clandestinely since the 1960s. It had an important center of operations in Venezuela, where Luis Posada Carriles was a key figure.\n\nThis documentary tells the story of terrorist Posada Carriles, since he started working for the CIA in the 1960s, until he was welcomed in Miami by the Bush Government in 2007. It reveals the tentacles of terrorism Made in the USA.\n90 minutes\n\nThe Venezuelan documentary film &quot;Posada Carriles: Terrorism Made in Usa&quot;, which is a part of TV series called InjerenCIA, showing a historical overview on terrorist Posada Carriles and his links with CIA, has been stopped by USA Security Services at Miami Airport. The film supported in DVD format was sent by means of a courier service from Caracas, destined to El Paso (Texas), to be received on Friday may 11 by an American Social Organization for exhibition purposes in that locality in connection with activities currently developed in several cities in USA to reject freedom granted to terrorist Posada Carriles.\n\nThe film is right now under custody of Bush Government. The report issued by the courier service states that the film stopped in transit is 'held by Government for inspection?'. This happened yesterday Thursday at 1:30 pm and still remains so. Therefore the exhibition scheduled for today Friday in Texas must be suspended because documentary has not arrived in time. The sole information received from Miami Airport is that inspection 'could last 8 days or more'.\n\nAs a matter of fact, today in El Paso (Texas), Bush Government censorship prevents American people to watch this documentary film about terrorist Posada Carriles.\n\nThere are hundreds of voices of torture victims and their relatives claiming for justice. There are thousands of unclassified documents providing proof of Posada Carriles attempts acting as a CIA agent, as well as many evidence of relationships between Bush family and Posada Carriles and other terrorists. Every day there are new voices joining this protest. It is not just an extradition claim from Venezuelan Government, but also a whole humanity which is sick ok abuse and crimes against human rights. All those voices, evidences and outcry for justice against terrorism shall not be silenced by Casablanca's censorship or maneuvers, because that's a worldwide outcry.  \n\n\nLet this torrent serve as a means to break through the US government censorship to its own people; afraid of letting them discover the truth...\n\n[Updated]\nThe guy got off here in America.
