But this book is much more than a series of formulas and calculations; the emphasis is on how to think about and use bond math.\n\nAuthor Donald J. Smith, a professor at Boston University and an experienced executive trainer, covers in detail money market rates, periodicity conversions, bond yields to maturity and horizon yields, the implied probability of default, after-tax rates of return, implied forward and spot rates, and duration and convexity. These calculations are used on traditional fixed-rate and zero-coupon bonds, as well as floating-rate notes, inflation-indexed securities, and interest rate swaps.\n\nPuts bond math in perspective through discussions of bond portfolios and investment strategies.\nCritiques the Bloomberg Yield Analysis (YA) page, indicating which numbers provide reliable information for making decisions about bonds, which are meaningless data, and which can be very misleading to investors\nFilled with thought-provoking insights and practical advice, this book puts the intricacies of bond math into a clear and logical order.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPreface xi\nCHAPTER 1: MoneyMarket Interest Rates 1\n\nInterest Rates in Textbook Theory 2\n\nMoney Market Add-on Rates 3\n\nMoney Market Discount Rates 6\n\nTwo Cash Flows, Many Money Market Rates 9\n\nA History Lesson on Money Market Certificates 12\n\nPeriodicity Conversions 13\n\nTreasury Bill Auction Results 15\n\nThe Future: Hourly Interest Rates? 20\n\nConclusion 22\n\nCHAPTER 2: Zero-Coupon Bonds 23\n\nThe Story of TIGRS, CATS, LIONS, and STRIPS 24\n\nYields to Maturity on Zero-Coupon Bonds 27\n\nHorizon Yields and Holding-Period Rates of Return 30\n\nChanges in Bond Prices and Yields 33\n\nCredit Spreads and the Implied Probability of Default 35\n\nConclusion 38\n\nCHAPTER 3: Prices and Yields on Coupon Bonds 39\n\nMarket Demand and Supply 40\n\nBond Prices and Yields to Maturity in a World of No Arbitrage 44\n\nSome Other Yield Statistics 49\n\nHorizon Yields 53\n\nSome Uses of Yield-to-Maturity Statistics 55\n\nImplied Probability of Default on Coupon Bonds 56\n\nBond Pricing between Coupon Dates 57\n\nA Real Corporate Bond 60\n\nConclusion 63\n\nCHAPTER 4: Bond Taxation 65\n\nBasic Bond Taxation 66\n\nMarket Discount Bonds 68\n\nA Real Market Discount Corporate Bond 70\n\nPremium Bonds 74\n\nOriginal Issue Discount Bonds 77\n\nMunicipal Bonds 79\n\nConclusion 82\n\nCHAPTER 5: Yield Curves 83\n\nAn Intuitive Forward Curve 84\n\nClassic Theories of the Term Structure of Interest Rates 86\n\nAccurate Implied Forward Rates 91\n\nMoney Market Implied Forward Rates 93\n\nCalculating and Using Implied Spot (Zero-Coupon) Rates 96\n\nMore Applications for the Implied Spot and Forward Curves 99\n\nConclusion 105\n\nCHAPTER 6: Duration and Convexity 107\n\nYield Duration and Convexity Relationships 108\n\nYield Duration 111\n\nThe Relationship between Yield Duration and Maturity 115\n\nYield Convexity 118\n\nBloomberg Yield Duration and Convexity 122\n\nCurve Duration and Convexity 127\n\nConclusion 135\n\nCHAPTER 7: Floaters and Linkers 137\n\nFloating-Rate Notes in General 138\n\nA Simple Floater Valuation Model 139\n\nAn Actual Floater 143\n\nInflation-Indexed Bonds: C-Linkers and P-Linkers 149\n\nLinker Taxation 153\n\nLinker Duration 156\n\nConclusion 161\n\nCHAPTER 8: Interest Rate Swaps 163\n\nPricing an Interest Rate Swap 164\n\nInterest Rate Forwards and Futures 168\n\nInferring the Forward Curve 170\n\nValuing an Interest Rate Swap 174\n\nInterest Rate Swap Duration and Convexity 179\n\nConclusion 184\n\nCHAPTER 9: Bond Portfolios 185\n\nBond Portfolio Statistics in Theory 185\n\nBond Portfolio Statistics in Practice 189\n\nA Real Bond Portfolio 194\n\nThoughts on Bond Portfolio Statistics 206\n\nConclusion 207\n\nCHAPTER 10: Bond Strategies 209\n\nActing on a Rate View 211\n\nAn Interest Rate Swap Overlay Strategy 215\n\nClassic Immunization Theory 218\n\nImmunization Implementation Issues 224\n\nLiability-Driven Investing 226\n\nClosing Thoughts: Target-Duration Bond Funds 227\n\nTechnical Appendix 231\n\nAcronyms 249\n\nBibliographic Notes 251\n\nAbout the Author 257\n\nAcknowledgments 259\n\nIndex 261\n\n\nAuthor Information\nDonald J.
