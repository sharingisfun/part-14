This, their debut album, comprises songs that were massive hits for the band in 1975 and 1976, such as the stepping classic &quot;Right Time&quot; and the rocking &quot;I Need a Roof&quot;. Recorded in the legendary Channel One Studio and backed by The Revolutionaries, featuring Sly Dunbar's whip-crack drumming and Robbie Shakespeare's distinctive bass style, every tune on this album is a rock-steady classic, combining some of the tightest reggae around with mellifluous yet sternly righteous rasta vocals. No surprise then that Right Time is regarded as an essential roots reggae album. --Duncan Thomson\n\n1.\tRight Time\n2.\tWhy Me Black Brother Why\n3.\tShame And Pride\n4.\tGnashing Of teeth\n5.\tThem Never Love Poor Marcus\n6.\tI Need A Roof\n7.\tGo Seek Your Rights\n8.\tHave Mercy\n9.\tNatural Natty\n10.\tAfrica\n11.\tRoof Top dub\n12.\tItal Step\n13.\tFence Dub\n14.\tIshens Dub\n15.\tTotal Dub\n16.\tMerciful dub\n17.\tCell Block ll\n18.\tKiller Dub\n19.\tBlacka Black Dub\n\nThis is a needledrop of the Original Virgin UK edition with some Vital Well Charged dubs added using Linn LP12, Lingo, Ekos and Dynavector XX2 moving coil cartridge, Via  Naim 62 pre-amp into Pioneer PDR-609 CDR, using TDK audio CDR.\n\nArt work included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9a3a0dd1b00b7dc8e62971ce1f3a59b24ee0f7","amp;dn":"Mighty+Diamonds+Right+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9a3a0dd1b00b7dc8e62971ce1f3a59b24ee0f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,154,58,13,209,176,11,125,200,230,41,113,206,31,58,89,178,78,224,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
