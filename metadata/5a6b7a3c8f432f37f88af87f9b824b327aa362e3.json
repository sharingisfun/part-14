It was created as a tribute to the band's earlier singer Bon Scott and included the two disc soundtrack to the movie Let There Be Rock, some early unreleased tracks, a live recording from the Atlantic Records studio in New York and a remastered version of Back in Black.\n\nThe album was originally released in 1997 with the CDs all packaged individually in jewel cases, complete with full artwork. The original issue also features a poster, a backstage pass, keyring and a few other extras depending on the region. When the album was reissued in 2003 it was packaged in a large digipak, similar to a longbox, which featured either 4 or 5 disc trays. The 4-tray versions contained the remastered Back in Black in its own case with booklet. All versions of the box feature a large book full of liner notes and rare pictures of the band, mostly from before Scott's death.\n\nThe boxset was the subject of a bit of derision from AC/DC fans for its limited content - two live albums (one previously released) and a select few rarities, as well as the Bon-inspired Back in Black, which of course does not feature Scott on vocals. AC/DC defended the release, stating that there was very little recorded by Scott that wasn't released.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \n1.Live from the Atlantic Studios\n \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Live Wire&quot; (T.N.T.) \t                           6:16\n2. \t&quot;Problem Child&quot; (Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap)      4:40\n3. \t&quot;High Voltage&quot; (T.N.T.) \t                   5:57\n4. \t&quot;Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be&quot; (Let There Be Rock) 4:14\n5. \t&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; (Let There Be Rock) \t           4:42\n6. \t&quot;The Jack&quot; (T.N.T.) \t                           8:37\n7. \t&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; (Let There Be Rock) \t   5:11\n8. \t&quot;Rocker&quot; (T.N.T.) \t                           5:33\n\n2.Let There Be Rock: The Movie - Live in Paris\n \nDisc 1 \t\nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Live Wire&quot; (T.N.T.) \t                           8:04\n2. \t&quot;Shot Down in Flames&quot; (Highway to Hell) \t   3:39\n3. \t&quot;Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be&quot; (Let There Be Rock) 4:31\n4. \t&quot;Sin City&quot; (Powerage) \t                           5:25\n5. \t&quot;Walk All Over You&quot; (Highway to Hell) \t           5:07\n6. \t&quot;Bad Boy Boogie&quot; (Let There Be Rock) \t           13:21\n\nDisc 2 \t\nNo. \t \t\n1. \t&quot;The Jack&quot; (T.N.T.) \t                           6:05\n2. \t&quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (Highway to Hell) \t           3:31\n3. \t&quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot; (Highway to Hell) \t           3:20\n4. \t&quot;High Voltage&quot; (T.N.T.) \t                   6:32\n5. \t&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; (Let There Be Rock) \t   4:55\n6. \t&quot;Rocker&quot; (T.N.T.) \t                           10:45\n7. \t&quot;T.N.T.&quot; (T.N.T.) \t                           4:14\n8. \t&quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; (Let There Be Rock) \t   7:34\n\n3.Volts\n \nNo. \t\n1. &quot;Dirty Eyes&quot;  \t  \t                           3:21\n(First title and lyrics to riffs of Whole Lotta Rosie)\n\n2. &quot;Touch Too Much&quot;    \t                                   6:34\n(Same title as the track on Highway to Hell, different lyrics and music)\n\n3. &quot;If You Want Blood  \t  \t                           4:28\n(You've Got It)&quot; (First recording)\n\n4. &quot;Back Seat Confidential&quot;  \t  \t                   5:24\n(First title and Lyrics to the riffs of Beatin' Around the Bush)\n\n5. &quot;Get It Hot&quot;  \t                                   4:17\n(Same title as the track on Highway to Hell, different lyrics and music)\n\n6. &quot;Sin City&quot;  \t  \t                                   4:58\n(Live from The Midnight Special)\n\n7. &quot;She's Got Balls&quot;  \t  \t                           7:57\n(From &quot;Bondi Lifesaver&quot;)\n\n8. &quot;School Days&quot;  \t                                   5:24\n(T.N.T.) \tChuck Berry\n\n9. &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top  \t  \t           5:15\n(If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot; (T.N.T.)\n\n10. &quot;Ride On&quot;  \t  \t                                   10:03\n(Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap)\n\n\n4.Back in Black (Remastered)\n \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Hells Bells&quot;   \t                           5:13\n2. \t&quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot;   \t                           5:18\n3. \t&quot;What Do You Do for Money Honey&quot;   \t           3:36\n4. \t&quot;Given the Dog a Bone&quot;   \t                   3:32\n5. \t&quot;Let Me Put My Love Into You&quot;   \t           4:15\n6. \t&quot;Back in Black&quot;   \t                           4:16\n7. \t&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;                      3:30\n8. \t&quot;Have a Drink on Me&quot;   \t                           3:59\n9. \t&quot;Shake a Leg&quot;   \t                           4:06\n10. \t&quot;Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution&quot;   \t   4:16\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a6b7a3c8f432f37f88af87f9b824b327aa362e3","amp;dn":"AcDc+-+1997+-+Bonfire+%285CD%29+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a6b7a3c8f432f37f88af87f9b824b327aa362e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,107,122,60,143,67,47,55,248,138,248,127,155,130,75,50,122,163,98,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
