Similar to the series Legends of The Dark Knight and Superman Confidential, this volume focused on early adventures and first meetings with revolving sets of creative teams for each story arc. Creators were free from continuity restraints, so some stories took liberties with established canon and should not always be considered definitive. The series was canceled with issue #54.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce1a34b3bdfe2624e4cf6a1d0360d5af73a31bc3","amp;dn":"Batman+Confidential+%28001+-+054%29+%282007+-+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce1a34b3bdfe2624e4cf6a1d0360d5af73a31bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,26,52,179,189,254,38,36,228,207,106,29,3,96,213,175,115,163,27,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
