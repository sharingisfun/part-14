The noona favorites are all grown up with hot new looks for their catchy urban electronica dance song Lucifer. The album is packed with 13 new songs including the old-school hip-hop tune UP &amp; DOWN, the melancholic rock ballad Quasimodo, R&amp;B ballad Life by Kenzie, and Love Still Goes On, a sequel to the SHINee's first album hit Love Should Go On. The members also participated in the songwriting this time, with Onew penning Your Named and Jong Hyun penning Shout Out.\n\nTracklist:\n01. UP &amp; DOWN\n02. Lucifer\n03. Electric Heart\n04.
