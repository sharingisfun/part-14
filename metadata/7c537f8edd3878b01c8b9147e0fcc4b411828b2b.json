Many books have been written about what BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new novel may include such as: MasonryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœoccultÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ symbolism, the assertion of its quasi religious practice, the connections between Freemasonry and the founding fathers, and the bizarre layout of Washington D.C. Each of these texts offer a glimpse into the present tense fraternity, as they ask the same questions that many masons themselves ask. But those books fall short of answering questions put forth by those without any prior knowledge of the craft. That is why this book is a must read for anyone asking the question What is Freemasonry?\nPersonal : My father,grandfather, and Great grandfather were all Masons,yet I am not.This was my choice. That being said, I personally find nothing wrong with the Masonic origination. I simply choose not to participate in a social organization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c537f8edd3878b01c8b9147e0fcc4b411828b2b","amp;dn":"What+is+Freemasonry+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c537f8edd3878b01c8b9147e0fcc4b411828b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,83,127,142,221,56,120,176,28,139,145,71,224,252,196,180,17,130,139,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
