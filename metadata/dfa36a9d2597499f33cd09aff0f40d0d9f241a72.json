According\r\nto Billboard magazine, she was the most successful artist of the 90s in the United States.\r\n\r\nMusic critic Jim Farber of Daily News said that Carey has &quot;a range wide enough to cover\r\nall the octaves between an alto and a soprano and the agility to move between those roles\r\nwith swiftness and aplomb&quot;, and her vocal trademark is her ability to sing in the whistle\r\nregister. Carey has cited Minnie Riperton as the greatest influence on her singing technique\r\nand from a very early age, she attempted to emulate Riperton's high notes, to increasing\r\ndegrees of success as her vocal range expanded.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, her voice was ranked first in MTV and Blender magazine's countdown of the 22 Greatest\r\nVoices in Music, as voted by fans and readers in an online poll. Carey said of the poll,\r\n&quot;What it really means is voice of the MTV generation. Of course, it's an enormous compliment,\r\nbut I don't feel that way about myself.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n1 - Through The Rain [04:49]\r\n2 - Boy [I Need You] [05:14]\r\n3 - The One [04:08]\r\n4 - Yours [05:06]\r\n5 - You Got Me [04:22]\r\n6 - I Only Wanted [03:38]\r\n7 - Clown [03:17]\r\n8 - My Saving Grace [04:09]\r\n9 - You Had Your Chance [04:22]\r\n10 - Lullaby [04:56]\r\n11 - Irresistable [05:04]\r\n12 - Subtle Invitation [04:27]\r\n13 - Bringin' On The Heatbreak [04:34]\r\n14 - Sunflowers For Alfred Roy [02:59]\r\n15 - Through The Rain [Remix] [03:32]\r\n16 - Miss You [Exclusive Bonus Track] [05:08]\r\n17 - I Know What You Want [Exclusive Bonus Track][05:26]\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: Mariah Carey\r\nGenre: Hip Hop / RnB / Swing\r\nAlbum Release Year: 1971/2003\r\nNumber of Tracks: 17\r\nTotal Duration: 1:15:18.413\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate: 942 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 L/R [Full Stereo]\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Source: Original CDs &gt; FLAC\r\nConverter: EAC V1.1 Test And Copy Secure Mode\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\r\nIncluded Artwork: [Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files]\r\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\r\nChecksums Files: Made with Traders Little Helper\r\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheets FLAC &amp; WAV, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP,foo_dr, and M3U\r\nTotal File Size: 512 MB\r\nRipped and Encoded By: oneanight\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa36a9d2597499f33cd09aff0f40d0d9f241a72","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey+-+Charmbracelet+%5BUK+Special+Edition%5D+2003+%5BEAC-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa36a9d2597499f33cd09aff0f40d0d9f241a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,163,106,157,37,151,73,159,51,205,9,175,240,244,13,13,159,36,26,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
