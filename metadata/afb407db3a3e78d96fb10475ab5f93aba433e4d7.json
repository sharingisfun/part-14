While most books on medicinal chemistry are organized on the basis of therapeutic or biochemical classes, materials in this series are arranged and discussed in terms of chemical structure. Thus, the preparation and detailed organic chemistry of the classes are presented in a unified way. Only drugs that have been granted a U.S. Adopted Name are included in this series. Synthetic organic, pharmaceutical, medicinal, and heterocyclic chemists will find this series an invaluable resource for their research in the synthetic chemistry of drug development.\n\nContents\nPAGE\nChapter 1.
