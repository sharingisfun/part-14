Covering the entire interior of the building, these works were painted between 1250 and 1310 by Medieval and Gothic artists including Cimabue, Giotto, Simone Martini and Pietro Lorenzetti. The history of the Basilica is recounted in this book, from the commission and construction of the building and the painting of the frescoes, to its current significance as home to the grave of St Francis. Beginning with a brief biographical portrait of St Francis, to whom the Basilica is dedicated, the book then analyzes the frescoes themselves. It traces the history of the Basilica through the ages, showing how the interior has been modified since its construction, and concluding with a look at the Basilica today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e8ee9e10013d5d84cea6066bcfe94832dea09f","amp;dn":"The+Basilica+of+St+Francis+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e8ee9e10013d5d84cea6066bcfe94832dea09f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,232,238,158,16,1,61,93,132,206,166,6,107,207,233,72,50,222,160,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
