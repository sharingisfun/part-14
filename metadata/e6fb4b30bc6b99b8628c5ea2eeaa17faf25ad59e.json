But one evening a fellow expatriate tips him off to a story: a charismatic American anthropologist, Martiya van der Leun, has been found dead--a suicide--in the Thai prison where she was serving a life sentence for murder. Curious at first, Mischa is soon immersed in the details of her story. This brilliant, haunting novel expands into a mystery set among the Thai hill tribes, whose way of life became a battleground for the missionaries and the scientists living among them. \r\n\r\nFieldwork is a 2007 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6fb4b30bc6b99b8628c5ea2eeaa17faf25ad59e","amp;dn":"Fieldwork_+A+Novel+-+Mischa+Berlinski","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6fb4b30bc6b99b8628c5ea2eeaa17faf25ad59e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,251,75,48,188,107,153,184,98,140,94,162,238,170,23,250,242,90,213,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
