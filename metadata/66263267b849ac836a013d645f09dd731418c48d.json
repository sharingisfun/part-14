The series will air on HBO on July 13, 2008 and span seven hours. It is produced by David Simon, Ed Burns, Nina K. Noble, Andrea Calderwood, George Faber, and Charles Pattinson.\n\nThrough the first episode of Generation Kill, HBO's miniseries about the elite Marine unit that led the first invasion of the Iraq war, it was difficult to keep track of which helmeted, smudged-faced character was which. I feared writer-producer David Simon (creator of The Wire) and longtime collaborator Ed Burns were just resorting to the old ''disorient the audience because war is really disorienting'' trope. I shoulda known better ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? this is one wild, clichÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©-busting trip. By the second of Kill's seven hours, I'd learned: who the sane center of this story would be (Alexander Skarsgard's quiet but firm Sgt. Brad Colbert); how Jennifer Lopez plays a big part in Marine fantasy life; and why Charms candy is bad luck in this war. Now, having watched all five of the episodes HBO sent for review, I'm psyched for more of this head-spinningly thoughtful work. Unlike Steven Bochco's 2005 Iraq-war flop Over There, Kill is unconcerned with sympathetic characters it lets its fact-based drama speak for itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf speed is too slow try the other one, The main file is the same so you can continue from it as well, just ignore the extra sample file in it.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4327669&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4327669&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66263267b849ac836a013d645f09dd731418c48d","amp;dn":"Generation+Kill+S01E04+HDTV+XviD-0TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66263267b849ac836a013d645f09dd731418c48d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,38,50,103,184,73,172,131,106,1,61,100,95,9,221,115,20,24,196,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
