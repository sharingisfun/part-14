Yet almost thirty years have elapsed without a major new translation of his writings. Remedying this state of affairs is Rimbaud Complete, the first and only truly complete edition of RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work in English, translated, edited, and introduced by Wyatt Mason.\n\nMason draws on a century of Rimbaud scholarship to choreograph a superbly clear-eyed presentation of the poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works. He arranges RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing chronologically, based on the latest manuscript evidence, so readers can experience the famously teenaged poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rapid evolution, from the lyricism of Ã¢â‚¬Å“SensationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the groundbreaking early modernism of A Season in Hell.
