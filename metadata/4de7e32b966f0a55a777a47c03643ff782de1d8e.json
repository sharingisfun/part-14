Its design is based on the critically acclaimed Close Combat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A Bridge Too Far, originally developed by Atomic Games. This is the most ambitious and most improved of the new Close Combat releases, but along with all the enhancements it retains the same addicting tactical action found in the original titles!\n\nInstallation: Just unzip, move to Applications and launch. Ported to mac by myself.\n\nMy Comments: A remake of probably one of the most realistic and fun RTS wargames I have ever played. This game is highly strategic so I recommend playing the tutorial (Boot Camp) first in full otherwise you will probably get your ass kicked. Once you get the hang of it though it is very rewarding. \n\nThe game has fantastic sound and detailed retro graphics. Units gain experience (like in RPGs) and behave very realistically. They can pick up enemy weapons when out of ammo and will desert you if their morale gets too low. There are also tanks and other vehicles as well as air and artillery strikes you can call in. Highly recommended.\n\nTip: Don't stand in front of a tank. ;p\n\nWineskin Settings: I have made the game windowed as I think this is the best way to play. However if you REALLY want full screen Right-Click on the app and select 'Show Package Contents'. Then Double-Click the 'Wineskin' icon. Now select 'Set Screen Options' and select 'Automatic'. Click 'Done' then 'Quit. Now when you launch the game it will be full screen.\n\nNote: If anyone has a cracked version of the 5.60.51 patch for this game (not requiring serial) or a serial/crack for Close Combat: Panthers in the Fog please let me know so I can port/update.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de7e32b966f0a55a777a47c03643ff782de1d8e","amp;dn":"Close+Combat%3A+Last+Stand+Arnhem+%28Mac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de7e32b966f0a55a777a47c03643ff782de1d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,231,227,43,150,111,10,85,167,119,164,124,3,100,63,247,130,222,29,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
