On that album, he uses six different Fender and Gibson guitars and amps of 1963 vintage and earlier. The material is very diverse. Included is the Les Paul tribute &quot;Cherokee,&quot; an eerie version of the Jackie Gleason theme &quot;Melancholy Serenade&quot; and an intricate construction around the Santo and Johnny standard &quot;Sleepwalk,&quot; this album deserves the accolades it has received. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3312a33387dd6ebd6f545b211187216e3d667db0","amp;dn":"Danny+Gatton+-+Unfinished+Business+%5B1987%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3312a33387dd6ebd6f545b211187216e3d667db0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,18,163,51,135,221,110,189,111,84,91,33,17,135,33,110,61,102,125,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
