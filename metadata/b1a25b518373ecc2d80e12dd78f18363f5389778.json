Beyond aircraft geometry parameterization, his research interests include design optimization techniques (in particular, evolutionary algorithms, machine learning systems and surrogate modelÃ¢â‚¬â€œassisted search heuristics), high altitude flight (on fixed wings or balloonÃ¢â‚¬â€œborne) and the use of additive manufacturing techniques in aircraft design.\n\nIn terms of applying these technologies, his main focus is on the design of high altitude unmanned air vehicles for scientific applications. He leads the ASTRA (Atmospheric Science Through Robotic Aircraft) initiative, which aims to develop high altitude unmanned air systems for meteorological and Earth science research. Previous work includes research into reducing the environmental impact of passenger airliners through unconventional airframe geometries, undertaken as part of a Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) Research Fellowship.\n\nAndrÃƒÂ¡s also lectures on the University s Aeronautical Engineering undergraduate course he leads the Aircraft Operations and Mechanics of Flight, and the Aircraft Design modules.\n\nAlexander I. J. Forrester was born and brought up in Wirksworth, Derbyshire in the north of England. He studied for a Masters in aerospace engineering, followed by a PhD in computational engineering at the University of Southampton where he is now a Senior Lecturer.\n\nHe is a member of the Computational Engineering and Design Research Group and the Institute for Life Sciences. His research interests lie in the efficient use of simulation and experiments in design optimization.\n\nAlex leads the teaching of engineering design across the UniversityÃ¢â‚¬Â²s Mechanical, Aeronautical and Ship Science firstÃ¢â‚¬â€œyear undergraduate courses. He also teaches design optimization to postgraduate level and supervises the UniversityÃ¢â‚¬Â²s undergraduateÃ¢â‚¬â€œdeveloped human powered aircraft.\n\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell (31 October 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470662573\nISBN-13: 978-0470662571","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a25b518373ecc2d80e12dd78f18363f5389778","amp;dn":"Aircraft+Aerodynamic+Design+Geometry+and+Optimization%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1a25b518373ecc2d80e12dd78f18363f5389778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,162,91,81,131,115,236,194,216,14,18,221,120,241,131,99,245,56,151,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
