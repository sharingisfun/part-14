Whether changing band members or even band names, nearly four years of honing their orchestral alt-pop sound has at last resulted in a debut full-length record. On A History of Reasons, the five-piece have pulled off their ambitious genre-blending with aplomb, skilfully fusing rock, pop and folk across 11 tracks.\nThe result of this musical mixture makes for an enthralling listen, tastefully shaped by the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention to layering and dynamics. Nate DanielsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vocals are at the forefront of each track, proving commanding from the wordless chant that begins the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title track. Harmonizing at times with his band mates, Daniels shows off his impressive range through soaring choruses, particularly on Ã¢â‚¬Å“With YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Render.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nToeing a line between scintillating pop and subdued folk, the precise rhythm section and reverb-laced guitar work are only made richer by the inclusion of Caitlin GrieveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s violin. Her playing functions well in instances of layered accompaniment and as a solo instrument, as demonstrated at the emotional pinnacle of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Starry Eyes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This compositional awareness allows the blending of genres across A History of Reasons to come together in a clean, coherent fashion without feeling forced Ã¢â‚¬â€ a strength that bodes well for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future.\nRating 7.8/10\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01-01 A History of Reasons.flac\n01-02 With You.flac\n01-03 AgeÃ¯Â¼ï¿½SexÃ¯Â¼ï¿½Race.flac\n01-04 Render.flac\n01-05 Kingdoms.flac\n01-06 One At A Time.flac\n01-07 Starry Eyes.flac\n01-08 Seventeen.flac\n01-09 Extinguishing Fires.flac\n01-10 Words &amp; Meaning.flac\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: Canada\nGenre: Indie\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~777-888 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e964f796dbc78291c7b1e280bb321d06daedd56","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Cairo+-+A+History+of+Reasons+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e964f796dbc78291c7b1e280bb321d06daedd56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,150,79,121,109,188,120,41,28,123,30,40,11,179,33,208,109,174,221,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
