Establishing himself as a Yuletide guest in the Brougham home, Dudley arouses the ire of Henry, who, unaware that his visitor is from Up Above, assumes that Dudley has designs on the bishop's wife Julia (Loretta Young). Eventually, the lives of both Henry and Julia are agreeably altered by the presence of the affable angel: He regains the &quot;common touch&quot; he'd almost lost, while she realizes anew how much she truly loves her husband. Adapted by Robert E. Sherwood and Robert Bercovicci from a novel by Robert Nathan, The Bishop's Wife was remade in 1996 as The Preacher's Wife, with Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston and Courtney B. Vance. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039190/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039190/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-39190/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-39190/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:44:58\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 512x384 4/3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1738 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,36 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:701bda107c8fd7d3cb69c80194eaf8c2edf52078","amp;dn":"The+Bishop%5C%27s+Wife+%281947%29+Cary+Grant+Eng+%28multisubs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"701bda107c8fd7d3cb69c80194eaf8c2edf52078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,27,218,16,124,143,215,211,203,105,200,1,148,234,248,194,237,245,32,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
