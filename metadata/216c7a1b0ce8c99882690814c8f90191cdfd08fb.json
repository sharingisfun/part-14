ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genius is as readily apparent in these comedies as in his timeless tragedies. Often marked by internal and external conflicts, young lovers struggling for union, mistaken identities, and intertwining plots, ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comedies to this day reveal the masterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unparalleled insight into the human condition. With a fresh take on some of ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most cherished and widely seen works, Professor Shargel provides an invaluable understanding of these exquisite comedies.\nLecture 1 Shakespeare, Comedy, and Shakespearean Comedy: The Comedy of Errors and LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LaborÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lost\n\nLecture 2 The Taming of the Shrew\n\nLecture 3 The Two Gentlemen of Verona\n\nLecture 4 A Midsummer NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dream, Part I\n\nLecture 5 A Midsummer NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dream, Part II\n\nLecture 6 The Merchant of Venice, Part I\n\nLecture 7 The Merchant of Venice, Part II\n\nLecture 8 Much Ado About Nothing, Part I\n\nLecture 9 Much Ado About Nothing, Part II\n\nLecture 10 As You Like It\n\nLecture 11 Twelfth Night, Part I\n\nLecture 12 Twelfth Night, Part II\n\nLecture 13 Measure for Measure\n\nLecture 14 The Music of ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Comedies: Shakespearean Verse and Song\n\n\n\n=========================================================\n\n&quot;Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, \nand the life of the candle will not be shortened.&quot;\n\n\n-- KNOWLEDGE never decreases by being shared!!\n\n\nShow your Thankfulness by seeding :)\n\n=========================================================\n\n\n\nIf you can afford, Subscribe from\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Modern-Scholar-Shakespeare-Great-Comedies/dp/B0029XKWV8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Modern-Scholar-Shakespeare-Great-Comedies/dp/B0029XKWV8&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:216c7a1b0ce8c99882690814c8f90191cdfd08fb","amp;dn":"Shakespeare+-Ten+Great+Comedies+-+TMS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"216c7a1b0ce8c99882690814c8f90191cdfd08fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,108,122,27,12,232,201,152,130,105,8,20,200,249,1,145,205,253,8,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
