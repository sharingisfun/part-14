From neurophysiology to behavioral psychology, we drew from an extraordinary body of research to help guide our product design efforts. Studies conducted by pioneering scientists provided us with initial baselines and calibrations that accelerated our designs. However, the real secret to the success of our products was the development and application of our own proprietary mind development technologies.\n\nAt the center of our research and testing is our internal experimentation process; using our own product development team to test the effects of experimental technologies. For example, when we wanted to know what the mix of certain embedded entrainment algorithms should be, we would design special one-off audio CDs that members of the team would listen to through headphones. While monitoring their responses, a specified number of sessions would be conducted; then carefully documented and analyzed. This testing process enabled us to understand various personal preferences, key soundtrack characteristics, and perhaps most importantly,specific psychological and physiological effects caused by the algorithms.\n\nThe X-Mind Series\n\nAt the height of this internal experimentation period, some extraordinary technologies emerged. From the life-changing Brain Supercharger and Ultra Meditation Series, to the Millionaire's Mind Success Conditioning System, Zygon's Mind Research Laboratory produced an amazing array of ground breaking products. There was one type of experimental program, however, that was never intended for public release.\n\nThe X-Mind programs were used by our team for experimentation purposes only. Being true mind warriors, we wanted to test the limits of the technologies we were creating, so we designed programs using settings in the extreme range. As one could imagine, many of these programs were incredible; taking us on mind-blowing journeys that rivaled any drug-induced experience - without any harmful side effects. Each one is approximately 30 minutes long and is designed for a specific mind tripping purpose.\n\nX1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Neuroin: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ultimate Mind TripÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis program starts with a soothing sensation created by light aural textures as your mind is being prepared for an incredible experience. Just like the trip Jodie Foster took in the movie Ã¢â‚¬Å“Contact,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ your ship takes off. You begin feeling universal forces permeate your very existence; shooting you through galactic worm holes, bouncing around fantastic nebulas, and even the nothingness of black holes. And then, ultimate peace and serenity as you complete your journey. You are refreshed and renewed.\n\nX2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Quantanium: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cosmic Energy TapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWow! Imagine a lightening bolt shooting straight down your spine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then shooting right back up again. Then doing it againÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and againÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and again! This program is like a rocket powered rollercoaster that shoots you from one galaxy to the next. When itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over, youÃ‚Â¹ll be infused with an incredible energy boost that will last for hours.\n\nX3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Infineon: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Suspended AnimationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHave you ever imagined what it would be like to slow time down to a crawl? So that a second lasted a day; a minute lasted a month; and an hour lasted a year? In the future, technology will be able to slow a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life rate down enough so that space travel to distant galaxies can be accomplished. Today, this X program creates the illusion of slowing time to a standstill. Using advanced audio-based settings, you will feel as if you were suspended in time; traveling to galaxies light years from Earth.\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nAll tracks secure rips &amp; AcurateRip verified.
