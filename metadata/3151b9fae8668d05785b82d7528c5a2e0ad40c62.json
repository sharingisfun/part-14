It was there at the Red Vic Theatre that the two men, even though they were in a confined movie theatre, thought &quot;Fuck it, man&quot; and fired up a joint \nof medicial Cali Kush prompting scores of other patron's to do the same in the theatre, thus becoming quite the far out scene. As Opio &amp; Unjust (who are both big fans of the cult classic) got deeper into the film, they came with the idea of the tribute. \n\nWith every scene and nuiance of the movie speaking to them creatively - Unjust was particularly intrigued with the soundtrack prompting him to use that as his base with all the beats sampled from the score. And always a master with the pen, Opio took to the dialgue and created subject matter that is loosely based around their own &quot;dude-like&quot; adventures. The end result being a piece of work that proves not only as a stand alone Hip Hop Album, but also a complimentary piece to the classic film. \n\nSo as not to be percieved as &quot;goldbrickers&quot; or &quot;biters&quot; (to use the parlance of our times), and to avoid getting bumped up into a different tax bracket, the fellas decided to give it away free....well...pay as you will. I mean, we know you probably owe money all over town, including to known pornographers....and that's cool....that's cool....so you don't have to pay anything. \n\nBut if you'd like to make a donation to the &quot;Little Hiero Achievers&quot; fund (even a $0.67 check for milk), well, we're not gonna stop you from really tying your 4/20 together....and no one will pee on your rug, promise. \n\n\nOn Deck: \nOpio's - &quot;Vulture's Wisdom Vol.2&quot; \nChosen Few's - &quot;New World Symphony&quot; \n(5.25.10 In Stores) \n\nFor More Information: \nBrett Morrow \n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c1a3b3a4b5b5acaeb3b3aeb681b3a3a2ecb3a4a2aeb3a5b2efa2aeac&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n(818) 843-0100","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3151b9fae8668d05785b82d7528c5a2e0ad40c62","amp;dn":"Opio+%26+Unjust+-+MARK+IT+ZERO+%28The+Big+Lebowski+tribute+album%29+%2A%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3151b9fae8668d05785b82d7528c5a2e0ad40c62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,81,185,250,232,102,141,5,120,91,130,215,82,140,90,46,10,212,12,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
