In the first part of the book simple one-period models are studied, in the second part the idea of dynamic hedging of contingent claims is developed in a multiperiod framework. Due to the strong appeal and wide use of this book, it is now available as a textbook with exercises. It will be of value for a broad community of students and researchers. It may serve as basis for graduate courses and be also interesting for those who work in the financial industry and want to get an idea about the mathematical methods of risk assessment.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPart I: Mathematical finance in one period \n\n1.
