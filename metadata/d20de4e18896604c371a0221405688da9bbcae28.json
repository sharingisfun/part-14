He plays with fingers, thumbs, fists and hands at once, suggesting a whole band at work: drummer, keyboardist, bassist and several guitarists at once. Some of his tunes invoke impressions of rock bands and duelling guitars, but he is also a player of blues or ballads reminiscent of Bill Evans, one of his musical idols.\n\nHis guitar style is characterised by the use of open tunings and percussive effects he generates with both hands on various parts of the guitar body, he names them appropriately rim shots and bongo hits.\n\nWhat follows is a collection of some of his albums...

His advanced technique and his sure feeling for rhythm combine with uncommon ideas to make his style instantly recognizable. He often uses percussive techniques and plays intricate down- and upstroke patterns with his thumb. His use of acrylic nails give him a sharp and very defined tone.\n\nWhat follows is a collection of some of his albums...
