In contrast, Artie Shaw recorded relatively few sides with his Gramercy Five. His original unit from 1940 found the great pianist Johnny Guarnieri playing harpsichord exclusively and matched Shaw's clarinet with trumpeter Billy Butterfield. Their eight recordings include &quot;My Blue Heaven,&quot; &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,&quot; and a million-seller, &quot;Summit Ridge Drive.&quot; The remainder of this CD is from 1945 and features Shaw, trumpeter Roy Eldridge, and the two young modernists, pianist Dodo Marmarosa (on piano) and guitarist Barney Kessel. Shaw would lead a few other Gramercy Fives in the future, but these are his two most famous. The music is consistently brilliant with every note counting. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide \n\n\n   Track list\n\n01.Special Delivery Stomp   Artie Shaw  (2:42) \n02.Summit Ridge Drive   Artie Shaw Artie Shaw &amp; His Orchestra (3:18) \n03.Keepin' Myself for You  ...

Artie Shaw's Gramercy Five, though, was an exceptional combo, as distinctive in its way as Benny Goodman's trio, quartet, and sextet. While the purpose of such bands was blowing, something Shaw did brilliantly, the clarinetist also used the opportunity for striking instrumentation.\nThe first eight tracks come from 1940 and the first version of the group. Trumpeter Billy Butterfield adds assorted mutes to vary his glorious open trumpet sound, while pianist Johnny Guarnieri turns exclusively to harpsichord. As with Shaw's unusual use of a string quartet in 1936, the inclusion of harpsichord is genuine innovation, not just novelty, and it becomes even more striking when Shaw adds electric guitarist Al Hendrickson. The result is classic small-band swing that can't be readily placed in time.\n\nThe final seven tracks come from 1945, including two takes of &quot;Mysterioso&quot; --a harmonically advanced Shaw composition, not the Monk tune. Shaw was always a kind of proto-modernist, and here the band includes the explosive swing trumpeter Roy Eldridge and two young boppers, pianist Dodo Marmarosa and guitarist Barney Kessel. --Stuart Broomer\n\nmp3   224kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c34660db4f134e579153c21afc38f8c64512560","amp;dn":"Artie+Shaw+-++The+Complete+Gramercy+Five+Sessions+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c34660db4f134e579153c21afc38f8c64512560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,52,102,13,180,241,52,229,121,21,60,33,175,195,143,140,100,81,37,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
