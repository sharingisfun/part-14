The show was issued in an edited form first on VHS and then DVD. Now for the first time the full concert is being released in the original running order, restored from the original 16mm film and with remastered sound. It s an extraordinary live show with a giant animatronic dragon towering over the stage and spectacular lasers and pyrotechnics.
