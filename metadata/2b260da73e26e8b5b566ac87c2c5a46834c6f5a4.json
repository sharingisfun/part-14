Three separate shows reveal Coltrane's ascending creative arc from hard bop innovator as a member of the Miles Davis Quartet in 1960 to consummate bandleader in 1961 to unrivalled jazz visionary in 1965. This DVD not only features Trane's classic quartet with Elvin Jones (drums), Jimmy Garrison (bass) and McCoy Tyner (piano), but also spotlights him onstage with other jazz legends including Stan Getz, Eric Dolphy and Oscar Peterson. Includes mind-blowing versions of his signature tunes &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; and &quot;Impressions&quot;. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to imagine that John ColtraneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recording career lasted only 12 years. His was an unending intellectual and spiritual quest through music. No one with such an extraordinary degree of talent worked as hard to master his instrument and to seek the deepest form of human expression through it.\nIn that 12 years, Coltrane was always instantly identifiable, yet always changing and evolving. The three performances on this DVD show in dramatic relief the most important phases of his career.\nThese newly discovered 1960 performances with Miles DavisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rhythm section find him near the end of his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsheets-of-soundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ period, which gave us such masterpieces as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMr. P.C.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGiant Steps.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Coltrane was anxious to form his own group and this final tour with Davis was a favor to the trumpeter. His restlessness shows through in his playing here and elsewhere at the time. It is fascinating to hear him with one of his early idols Stan Getz and his playing seems to challenge Getz to a new level..\nThe 1965 Comblain-La-Tour performance, providing some great visuals, allows us to see the group at the peak of its powers and near the end of its run. By the end of the year, McCoy and Elvin were gone and one of the most innovative and exciting ensembles in jazz was no more.\n\nLIVE IN GERMANY 1960\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohn Coltrane (Tenor &amp; Soprano Sax)\nWynton Kelly (Piano)\nPaul Chambers (Bass)\nJimmy Cobb (Drums)\nwith guests \nOscar Peterson (Piano)\nStan Getz (Tenor Sax)\n\nPlaylist\n\nOn Green Dolphin Street\nWalkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nThe Theme \nAutumn Leaves\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s New\nAutumn In NY\nHackensack\n\nLIVE IN GERMANY 1961\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohn Coltrane (Tenor &amp; Soprano Sax)\nEric Dolphy (Alto Sax &amp; Flute)\nMcCoy Tyner (Piano)\nReggie Workman (Bass)\nElvin Jones (Drums)\n \nPlaylist\nMy Favorite Things\nEvÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢rytime We Say Goodbye\nImpressions\n\nLIVE IN BELGIUM 1965\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohn Coltrane (Tenor &amp; Soprano Sax)\nMcCoy Tyner (Piano)\nJimmy Garrison (Bass)\nElvin Jones (Drums) \n\nPlaylist\nVigil\nNaima\nMy Favorite Things\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : F:\\MUSIC UP\\John Coltrane Live in 60 61 &amp;\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 355 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 36mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 515 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf52.31.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : xvid\nCodec ID                         : xvid\nDuration                         : 1h 36mn\nBit rate                         : 437 Kbps\nWidth                            : 704 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 3:2\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.043\nStream size                      : 301 MiB (85%)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 36mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 64.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 44.1 MiB (12%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 26 ms (0.78 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 26 ms\nWriting library                  : LAMEUUULAME3.98\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b260da73e26e8b5b566ac87c2c5a46834c6f5a4","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+Live+in+60+61+%26+65%28avi%29%28jazz%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b260da73e26e8b5b566ac87c2c5a46834c6f5a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,38,13,167,62,38,232,181,181,102,172,135,194,197,164,104,52,198,245,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
