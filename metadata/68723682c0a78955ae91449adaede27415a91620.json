While retaining treatments of basic aspects of molding, solidification, cast structures and feeding, newer developments in modeling and rapid prototyping are reviewed, together with quality, environmental, health and other issues of growing importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew edition of well-known book.\r\n\r\nFully updated with latest technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68723682c0a78955ae91449adaede27415a91620","amp;dn":"Foundry+Technology+2nd+ed+-+Peter+Beeley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68723682c0a78955ae91449adaede27415a91620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,114,54,130,192,167,137,85,174,145,68,154,218,237,226,116,21,169,22,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
