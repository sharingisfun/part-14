Like other young bands (for example Tir na n&amp;#039;Og and Irish Stew of Sindidun later on) they started playing Irish folk music combined with pop and rock elements. Their music led to a popularisation of Irish and Celtic music and other aspects of Irish and Celtic culture in Serbia, especially Guinness beer. The band members are fans of the Celtic F.C.[citation needed]. Despite their unusual music, since their founding in 1993 they have become one of the more popular and notable bands in Serbia.\n\nThe band started their career with traditional Irish songs and, gradually, introduced more and more of their own material (lyrics mostly by Aleksandar, music mostly by Ana). All their songs are in English, but the group has composed some purely instrumental songs as well. In addition, the band has released several videos.\n\nThe Orthodox Celts have had several tours and numerous concerts inside and outside of the country (including the Sava Center, one of the largest concert halls in Serbia). It is already a tradition of theirs to celebrate St. Patrick&amp;#039;s Day with a large concert in the synagogue of Novi Sad.\n\nIn all of the band&amp;#039;s interviews, they state that their greatest desire is to tour Ireland, but up to now no band member has ever visited that country.\n\n\nDiscography Files in torrent:\n\nOrthodox Celts - A Moment Like The Longest Day\nOrthodox Celts - Best Of Irish Folk\n--Orthodox Celts - Cafe Dublin\nOrthodox Celts - Dance Of The Celts\nOrthodox Celts - Images\nOrthodox Celts - Irish Country Favourites\nOrthodox Celts (1995) - Ortodox Celts\nOrthodox Celts (1997) - Strike Again\nOrthodox Celts (1999) - Green Roses\nOrthodox Celts (2000) - The Best Of\nOrthodox Celts (2007) - One, Two ... 5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d92d68fe622ca84a3a420865a495b1179e7d24","amp;dn":"Orthodox+Celts+%7BDiskografija%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d92d68fe622ca84a3a420865a495b1179e7d24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,217,45,104,254,98,44,168,74,58,66,8,101,164,149,177,23,158,125,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
