Surprisingly, the answer isn't as daunting as she expected. With a little math and a lot of determination, Janice cuts back, saves up, and buys herself two years of freedom in Europe.\n\nA few days into her stop in Paris, Janice meets Christophe, the cute butcher down the streetÃ¢â‚¬â€who doesn't speak English. Through a combination of sign language and Franglais, they embark on a whirlwind Paris romance. She soon realizes that she can never return to the world of twelve-hour workdays and greasy corporate lingo. But her dwindling savings force her to find a way to fund her dreams again. So Janice turns to her three lovesÃ¢â‚¬â€words, art, and ChristopheÃ¢â‚¬â€to figure out a way to make her happily-ever-after in Paris last forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e707b1a92cbdbfc624d47e6c42d6b9ff72d6515","amp;dn":"Paris+Letters+%28Janice+MacLeod%29+Retail+epub+PDF+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e707b1a92cbdbfc624d47e6c42d6b9ff72d6515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,112,123,26,146,203,219,252,98,77,71,230,196,45,107,159,247,45,101,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
