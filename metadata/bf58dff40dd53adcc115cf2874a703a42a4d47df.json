My Kind of Broadway music CDs Most of the songs -- from &quot;Luck Be a Lady&quot; and &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; to &quot;I'll Only Miss Her When I THink of Her,&quot; &quot;They Can't Take That Away From Me,&quot; &quot;Yesterdays,&quot; and &quot;Nice Work If You Can Get It&quot; -- are classics, but the arrangements and performances frequently are nothing more than competent. My Kind of Broadway songs When Sinatra delivers, as he does on the show-stopper &quot;Luck Be a Lady,&quot; the results are pretty spectacular, but the majority of the album is merely pleasant.
