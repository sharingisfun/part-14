'Alone Together' staked out the solo territory from which Mason has rarely strayed: a rather relaxed and reserved take-off from hard rock, featuring somber, bittersweet melodies, basic guitar/keyboards arrangements, as well as Mason's restrained vocals and blues-derived though not bluesy Electric guitar. 'It's Like You Never Left' smoothed out some of the singers few edges, while simultaneously picking up pace: it has more polished and full scoring but little bite. Still, the record has some of Mason's best writing. The backup band included Graham Nash singing and Stevie Wonder on harmonica.&quot; ***\n- Charley Walters, Rolling Stone\n\n&quot;Once again Mason, whose music has all but disappeared amid corporate machinations over the past few years, can offer new material in finished studio versions, and I bet he's genuinely happy about it. The vague romantic dolor of his songs, after all, is a professional gimmick rather than a personal commitment, and the welcome-back-folks title probably expresses his very deepest feelings. But for me it's like I was never here in the first place.&quot; C\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f294c2edb97428ddd3c6cd863200c1bc89669a6","amp;dn":"Dave+Mason+-+It%27s+Like+You+Never+Left+%281974+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f294c2edb97428ddd3c6cd863200c1bc89669a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,41,76,46,219,151,66,141,221,60,108,216,99,32,12,27,200,150,105,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
