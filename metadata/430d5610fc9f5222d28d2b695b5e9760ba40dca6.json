Use 700+ materials, 50+ lighting environments, labels, texture and opacity maps to create exactly the look you need. Use the intuitive animation system to apply transforms on models and cameras to see an animation take shape before your eyes in real time. Sequence and adjust your animation as it plays. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been an easier way to create 3D renderings, animations and design variations on the fly.\n\nRealtime Raytracing - KeyShot is the first real-time ray tracing and global illumination program that uses a physically correct rendering engine certified by the CIE (International Commission on Illumination). Whether you are creating 3D renderings or animations, you see everything happen instantly, in KeyShotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s realtime raytraced viewport, decreasing the time it takes to create photorealistic 3D images.\n\nInstant Real World Lighting - Drag and drop lighting environments to see the change in shadow, highlight and reflection immediately. All of the environmental lights inside KeyShot can accurately simulate differences in brightness from a simple LED all the way up to the intensity of the sun and cast shadows accordingly. And to get you started, there is no intitial lighting setup necessary for you to acheive immediate realistic lighting.\n\nScientifically Accurate Materials - All KeyShot materials are scientifically accurate and have physical properties based on real world materials. The material types contain only the properties necessary for creating that specific type. For example, you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find a property under the Ã¢â‚¬Å“GlassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ material that will make it look like a metal. This makes setting up realistic materials extremely easy, foolproof and faster than ever.\n\nAnimation - KeyShot revolutionary new animation system brings a whole new level of creating animations quickly and easily to your product development pipeline. KeyShot doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rely on inserting and managing keyframes. Instead, apply individual transforms (rotations, translations, etc.) to set up new animations with a click of button, and update materials and lighting as the animation plays.\n\n64-bit architecture - KeyShot is built on 64-bit architecture giving you the power and ability to utilize more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory with any modern 64-bit system. KeyShot is cross=platform compatibly and can be used on both Microsoft Windows and Apple computers.\n\nCPU-Powered - KeyShot is 100% CPU-Powered. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need any special hardware or graphics card. KeyShot takes full advantage of all cores and threads inside a computer. As your computer gets more powerful, KeyShot becomes faster. The performance scales linearly with the number of cores and threads in your system.\n\nInteractive Labeling - Labels are designed for easy placement of logos, stickers or images that need to be placed freely onto a 3D model. Common image formats are supported such as jpg, tiff, tga, and png. Multiple labels can be added to a material and each label has its own mapping type. Images with transparency are supported as well.\n\nBump-mapping - Bump maps are images used to create fine details in materials that would be unrealistic to build into the model. Brushed metals and textured plastics are easily created using bump maps. Any common format color or grayscale image can be used as a bump map. With these images the bright and dark areas are interpreted as high and low spots on the surface.\n\nRender Queue - The render queue is used to batch process image and animation rendering. You can simply add an image or animation Ã¢â‚¬Å“jobÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the queue from various files throughout the day, then click the Ã¢â‚¬Å“process queueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ button to start the queue rendering. Each job records the state of the scene and all render settings. The system can be left for the night to process the jobs.\n\nNetwork Rendering - The network rendering system allows you to take advantage of multiple systems for rendering images and animations. After the simple installation process, any user with KeyShot can send a Ã¢â‚¬Å“jobÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to be rendered on the network. The jobs are organized into a queue that all users can view. Jobs can also be sent from the internal KeyShot queue to network rendering.\n\nLive Linking - Live linking allows seamless model updates between the modeling software and KeyShot, without having to reassign materials, set up animations again, or update settings. Transfer your design from Creo, SolidWorks, or Rhino to KeyShot. Assign materials and animations, continue modeling and push over changes to KeyShot. Changed parts will be replace and updated with the new parts and all materials and animations will be maintained.\n\nImport options - With over 20 supported 3D file formats, KeyShot imports the largest number of file types of any 3D rendering software. Along with being able to handle large data sets and different file types, KeyShot provides options to make sure your data is imported accurately and ready to apply materials. With plugins for 3ds Max, Creo, Pro/ENGINEER, Rhinoceros, SolidWorks and SketchUp, import capabilities are extended even further.\n\nWhat is KeyShotVR?\n\n KeyShotVR is a patent-pending technology that brings the advantage of interactive 3D-enabled viewing via desktop, laptop or mobile device to produce portfolios, presentations and collateral for design reviews. Product designers, marketers and KeyShot users who want to extend the presentation of their visuals are able to create the high-quality, ray-traced 3D content directly from inside KeyShot. KeyShotVR is an integrated add-on to KeyShot Pro that automatically generates the code to be embedded into any website or company intranet, making it a turnkey solution for web content creation.\n\nWhy KeyShot for Animation?\n\n LuxionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolutionary new patent-pending 3D Animation system brings a whole new level of creating animations quickly and easily to your product development pipeline. KeyShot doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rely on inserting and managing keyframes. Instead, apply individual transforms (rotations, translations, etc.) to set up new animations with a click of button, and update materials and lighting as the animation plays.\n\nSupport\n\n- Autodesk Alias 2010 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2013 (needs to be installed)\n - Autodesk AutoCAD (dxf, dwg)\n- Autodesk Inventor 2010 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2013\n- Autodesk Maya 2010 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2013 (needs to be installed and licensed)\n- Dassault SystÃƒÂ¨mes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ CATIA v4/5\n- Dassault SystÃƒÂ¨mes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SolidWorks 2013 and prior\n - Google SketchUp 8 and prior\n - PTC Creo 2.0 and prior\n - PTC Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 5 and prior\n - Rhinoceros 4 and prior\n - Siemens NX 8 and prior\n - Siemens Solid Edge ST5 and prior\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n - INTEL Pentium 4 processor or AMD or better\n - Windows 7 64 bit\n - Windows 8 64 bit\n - OpenGL 2.x or higher\n - Minimum 2GB of RAM\n - Minimum 1GB hard disk space\n - 3 button mouse\n - Monitor resolution of 1024 X 768 or greater\n\nLanguages : English, FranÃƒÂ§ais, Deutsch, Italiano, Polski, EspaÃƒÂ±ol, Ã„Å’eÃ…Â¡tina, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:430d5610fc9f5222d28d2b695b5e9760ba40dca6","amp;dn":"Luxion+KeyShot+Pro+4.0.74+%28+x64+%29+%2B+Animation+%2B+KeyShotVR+DeLtAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"430d5610fc9f5222d28d2b695b5e9760ba40dca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,13,86,16,252,159,82,34,210,141,43,105,91,94,151,96,186,64,220,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
