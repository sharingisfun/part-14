What is fascinating is that the vast majority of truly awesome and trailer-worthy shots come from just a handful of techniques, which we explore in HOT MOVES.\n\nWhile it of course lends itself to very high-budget shooting, the majority of the techniques can be executed even on a very low budget, because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the understanding of motion that makes it a hot move, not the equipment you shoot it with. \n\nChapter List\n\n1.
