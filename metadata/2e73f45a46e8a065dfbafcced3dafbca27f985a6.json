Cobb\nWritten by: Richard Murphy (screenplay), Fulton Oursler (article) \nDirected by: Elia Kazan\n\nNotes:\n\n - All thanks go to PublicHD for the orginal 720p here: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7959131/Boomerang.1947.720p.BluRay.x264-PSYCHD_%5BPublicHD%5D . All that I did is transcode it as I found it too large (4.8GB) for an old black-and-white, 720p or not. I tried to choose the settings well to optimize the encode so that there is little to no perceptible loss of quality yet it's less than one-quarter the size.\n\n - I kept the audio as stereo rather than transcoding down to mono as some artificial stereo separation may have been introduced as an added bonus in the Blu-Ray mastering process\n\n - If Twelve Angry Men should be required viewing for jurors, then this should be required viewing for prosecutors! And interestingly, Lee J. Cobb co-starred in both. However, this movie is closely based on a true story.\n\n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e73f45a46e8a065dfbafcced3dafbca27f985a6","amp;dn":"Boomerang%21+%281947%29+720p+H.264-MPEG4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e73f45a46e8a065dfbafcced3dafbca27f985a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,115,244,90,70,232,160,101,223,186,252,206,211,218,251,202,39,249,133,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
