She dreams of being a writer someday, with a family by her side. But she has a secret: she's broken. Her saving grace is her best friend, Elijah, who has no idea she's in love with him. Their stars collide as they share a night of passion that changes their world forever, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one problem: Elijah doesn't remember, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting married to someone else in a week. How will their friendship ever survive this, or will it develop into something more? Rochelle is determined not to lose her best friend, even if that means she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have him at all.&quot;\n\nReview from Amzon:&quot;This book was truly a great read! It's novella length, but don't let that fool you. (I'm already into book 3, by the way, and so far it's a great series). The love story is really true to life, with the main character, Rochelle, torn over her best friend, Elijah. Is he just a friend? She wants more, or does she? Also, Rochelle is a great female lead. Smart and intelligent. Finally a female character that isn't stupid! I read a lot of books, so I choose carefully what gets my time. The dialogue is smart, and the story really pulls you in. (Especially if you like Paris!). I recommend this book to anyone who likes a romantic series that doesn't follow the typical &quot;formula&quot; you get over and over with other romance books. A must read!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64f1907f618a801095906cbf2f44c4105550cf87","amp;dn":"The+Writer+-+Romance+ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64f1907f618a801095906cbf2f44c4105550cf87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,241,144,127,97,138,128,16,149,144,108,191,47,68,196,16,85,80,207,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
