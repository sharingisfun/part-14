The Mississippi-raised singer/songwriter continues his knack for capturing romantic themes from a Christian perspective, offering his tales of young love and family life with an easygoing demeanor. With bright synth textures and rippling programmed grooves, producer John Fields adds a radio-friendly sheen to BarnesÃƒâ€ s latest tunes without obscuring their plainspoken charm. Whether heÃƒâ€ s delivering a soulful plea for forgiveness (ÃƒÂ´White FlagÃƒÂ¶), daydreaming about domestic bliss in the country (ÃƒÂ´Love Will Be Enough for UsÃƒÂ¶), or cuddling with his sweetheart under a Southern moon (ÃƒÂ´Warm Heart in a Cold WorldÃƒÂ¶), Barnes can be simultaneously wholesome and seductive. Regretful tracks like ÃƒÂ´Missing YouÃƒÂ¶ and ÃƒÂ´SeventeenÃƒÂ¶ add some blue notes to the prevailing mood of happiness. In ÃƒÂ´Mine to LoveÃƒÂ¶ and ÃƒÂ´One of Us,ÃƒÂ¶ Barnes celebrates a child's birth with warmth and gratitude.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. White Flag  (03:25), 7.87 MB\n02. How Long  (03:04), 7.06 MB\n03.
