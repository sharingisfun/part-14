With Stephan GebÃƒÂ©di's (guitar, vocals) and Paul Baayens' (guitars) duties with their other bands - HAIL OF BULLETS and ASPHYX - it has become a bit quiet around Netherland's longest running extreme metal band. But 2014 marks THANATOS' 30th anniversary and their return to full power. And what would be better than to celebrate this event with the release of THANATOS' fiercest, most merciless and mature album to date? Global Purificationcontains 10 tracks of exterminating death/thrash that bring back memories of the days when metal was about breaking rules-- instead of creating them.\n- Century Media\n\n*image\n\n\nTrack List\n\n1.

An illustrious name that has been haunting the Underground Metal scene since 1984Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ After several demo tapes and line-up changes, Thanatos released two classic Thrash/Death Metal albums in the early 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s: Ã¢â‚¬ËœEmerging From The NetherworldsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Shark Records/Cargo 1990) and Ã¢â‚¬ËœRealm Of EcstasyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Shark Records/Cargo 1992). The band shared the stage with the likes of Kreator, Sepultura, Death, Napalm Death, Bolt Thrower, Autopsy and Death Angel to name but a few. In 1992 Thanatos split up due to a variety of reasons but was revived in 1999 by founding member Stephan GebÃƒÂ©di, featuring a new line-up that included members from Sinister, Houwitser and Cremation. The third Thanatos album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœAngelic EncountersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, was released in 2000 by Hammerheart Records, followed by more shows with bands like Morbid Angel, Vader, Dying Fetus, Exhumed, Cryptopsy, Krisiun, Destruction and Necrophagia. Despite great reviews the band was not totally satisfied with this album. Two more personnel changes followed.\nIn 2002 the band recorded four new songs and two covers in a small 8-track studio to attract some interest from record companies. Baphomet Records/Red Stream released these recordings as the Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeyond TerrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Mini CD.\nThanatos signed a recording deal with Greek label Black Lotus Records in 2003, resulting in the release of Ã¢â‚¬ËœUndead.Unholy.Divine.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the next year. While recording their fifth full-length Ã¢â‚¬ËœJustified GenocideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the band was informed of Black Lotus RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bankruptcy and the album was put on hold.\nIn 2009, a quarter of a century after the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first incarnation, Ã¢â‚¬ËœJustified GenocideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ finally will be released by a partner closer to home. The quartet signed a deal with Holland based Deity Down Records. Ã¢â‚¬ËœJustified GenocideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ features the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strongest songs so far. Their typical mix of old school thrash and death metal still stands tall and these are the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most raw and in your face sounding recordings ever. Ã¢â‚¬ËœJustified GenocideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was recorded at Excess Studio in Rotterdam, Netherlands and mixed and mastered by Dan SwanÃƒÂ¶ (Edge Of Sanity, Bloodbath, Moontower) at Unisound Studio in Sweden. In December 2009 drummer Yuri was replaced by Marco de Groot (also in Houwitser, formerly in Altar, Blind Justice a.o.). 2010 will see Thanatos return to the live front.\n- Last.fm\n\nenjoy and seed this, go to the shows and support the artists\nGenre: Death\nSubgenre: The first Dutch Death Metal band\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 103.20 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n11 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd962012e752792d4b10a7c617871ee25c0940c6","amp;dn":"Thanatos+-+Global+Purification+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd962012e752792d4b10a7c617871ee25c0940c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,150,32,18,231,82,121,45,75,16,167,198,23,135,30,226,92,9,64,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
