The film is based on a play by Carson McCullers and stars Ethel Waters, Julie Harris, Brandon De Wilde, Arthur Franz and Nancy Gates.\n\nOur overall rating for The Member of the Wedding is: very good, a genuinely well-made film that has many impressive qualities.\n\nAh, the domestic drama. Watching one is like riding a roller coaster: though its highs and lows are thrilling, at some point you will wish you had never gotten on board, and by the end you are emotionally exhausted and a bit nauseous. The Member of the Wedding is a deceptively simple little film, and this simplicity is what makes the film so explosive. Based on the novel and subsequent play by the great Carson McCullers, The Member of the Wedding stars Julie Harris, Ethel Waters, and Brandon De Wilde, all reprising their roles from the Broadway production, and is directed by the great Fred Zinnemann, one of American film's finest directors.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.00gb\nDuration.... 01:20:48\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 632\nFrame Height....460\nData Rate.... 1487kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
