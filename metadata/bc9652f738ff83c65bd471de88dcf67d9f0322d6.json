The enhanced audio iso works without any effort on your part when the bin and the iso are in the same directory and when they are both named &quot;pier&quot;. It automatically boots to the enhanced audio on this emulator when you have it in this format and I am 3 hours in and haven't had any issues yet and the audio sounds great. (I imagine you can change the name to anything as long as they are identical for both files, but haven't tried it and don't care to.)\n\n\nHave fun and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc9652f738ff83c65bd471de88dcf67d9f0322d6","amp;dn":"Pier+Solar+w%2F+Enhanced+Audio+%5Bnuneral%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc9652f738ff83c65bd471de88dcf67d9f0322d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,150,82,247,56,255,131,198,91,212,113,222,136,220,246,125,159,3,34,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
