She is skilled\nin hand-to-hand combat, weapons training, and foreign languages - and does them all\nin tight outfits. Well, the planets of the solar system are going into planetary\nalignment (Which occurs every 5,000 years), and a secret society called the\nIlluminati is seeking an ancient talisman that gives its possessor the ability\nto control time. However, they need a certain clock/key to help them in their\nsearch, and they have to find the talisman in one week or wait until the next\nplanetary alignment to find it again. Lara happens to find that key hidden in\na wall of her mansion. The Illuminati steal it, and Lara gets an old letter\nfrom her deceased father telling her about the society's agenda (Her father\nwas also the one who hid the key). Now, she must retrieve the key and find and\ndestroy the talisman before the Illuminati can get their hands on it.\n\n\nAngelina Jolie ... Lara Croft\nJon Voight ... Lord Richard Croft\nIain Glen ...
