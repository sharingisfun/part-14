But whenever Daniel looks around, real people seem to be speaking his dialogue in real situations that mirror the script, including a beautiful young girl named Sandra who works in a Karaoke bar owned by a Mr. Mallion. Meanwhile, Balmer, the film's director, is in a spot of trouble with the leading lady of the film.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115230/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115230/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCold Lazarus\n\n\nDr. Emma Porlock and her colleagues, attempting to unlock the secrets of human memory for the Masdon drug empire, get a cryogenically stored 400-year-old human head to project its memories through virtual reality displays. But Porlock and her team are chronically under-funded, and she may have to go around Masdon to a media sleaze merchant to get the money she needs to maintain the project. But an even more complex world of secret police, RON (Reality-Or-Nothing) riots, and murder is going on outside the lab. And the deeper Porlock goes into the frozen memories of the writer Daniel Feeld, the more twisted the labyrinth of intrigue becomes.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115140/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115140/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69ba700de0977d156798202be825111d7779f46c","amp;dn":"Karaoke+and+Cold+Lazarus+BBC+1996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69ba700de0977d156798202be825111d7779f46c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,186,112,13,224,151,125,21,103,152,32,43,232,37,17,29,119,121,244,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
