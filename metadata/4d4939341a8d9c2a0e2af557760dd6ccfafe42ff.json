CarrÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s elegant short stories read like the gothic, family narratives of Flannery OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connor or Carson McCullers, but told visually. Poetic rhythms Ã¢â‚¬â€ a coin flip, a circling ferris wheel Ã¢â‚¬â€ are punctuated by elements of melancholy fantasy pushed forward by character-driven, naturalistic dialogue. The stories in Heads Or Tails display a virtuosic breadth of visual styles and color palettes, each in perfect service of the story, and range from experimental one-pagers to short masterpieces like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Thing About MadelineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (featured in The Best American Comics 2008), to graphic novellas like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The CarnivalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (featured in David SedarisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Dave EggersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 2010 Best American Nonrequired Reading, originally published in MOME).
