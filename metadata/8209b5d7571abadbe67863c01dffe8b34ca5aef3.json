The last of the 'Berlin Trilogy' recorded in collaboration with Brian Eno, it was produced in Switzerland and New York City, and was more accessible than its immediate predecessors Low and &quot;Heroes&quot;, having no instrumentals and being somewhat lighter and more pop-oriented. It was still an experimental record in many ways and was not, by Bowie's standards, a major commercial success. Indifferently received by critics on its initial release, it is now widely considered one of Bowie's most underrated albums\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nQuality: FLAC, tracks, +.cues\n\nTracklist:\n1.
