S.H.I.E.L.D. sends secret agent Ran Shen to collect two Nazi scientists with the key to winning the Cold War. But the Soviets want the scientists, as well, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve unleashed their most dangerous operative: the Winter Soldier, aka the brainwashed and presumed-dead partner of Captain America Ã¢â‚¬â€ Bucky Barnes! His mission: acquire the scientists by any means necessary Ã¢â‚¬â€ or kill them. The only obstacles in the Winter SoldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way are an elite Hydra squad run by Chancellor Cassandra and Madam Worm Ã¢â‚¬â€ and his own returning memories! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a classic Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s-style, high-octane spy pulp told at the Cold WarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peak, filled with intrigue, adventure, romance and murder Ã¢â‚¬â€ with ramifications that will shatter relationships in the modern-day Marvel Universe! Witness the birth of the man who will one day destroy Captain America: the Iron Nail!&quot;\n\nThis is all 5 issues of the series in digital copies thanks to BlackManta-Empire. There are also digital rips by Minutemen-PhD available, but the fifth issue of that run is not yet released so for the sake of uniformity, I have elected to use the Empire versions. Please seed and enjoy.\n\n*NOTE - I have not renamed the files themselves, so the numbering and titles are a little strange. However, that is because of respect for the scanners. \n\nPlease visit and support my Suprbay release thread here, I would appreciate it:       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:157227ed376d3a8b1552947122c1a6f4bb0f750d","amp;dn":"Winter+Soldier+-+The+Bitter+March+01-05+%282014%7CDigital%7CBlackManta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"157227ed376d3a8b1552947122c1a6f4bb0f750d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,114,39,237,55,109,58,139,21,82,148,113,34,193,166,244,187,15,117,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
