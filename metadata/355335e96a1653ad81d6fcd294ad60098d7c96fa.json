Released prior to a quiet, lengthy hiatus, Too Young to Die collects all of their singles, from their debut disco cover of Neil Young\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\&quot; to their last, \\&quot;He\\&amp;#039;s on the Phone,\\&quot; providing a thoroughly entertaining chronicle of the group\\&amp;#039;s career. Much of the music sounds somewhat dated -- which is always a problem with dance music -- but Saint Etienne was essentially a very good Euro-pop band, reveling in kitsch and style in equal measure. At their best -- \\&quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart,\\&quot; \\&quot;You\\&amp;#039;re in a Bad Way,\\&quot; \\&quot;Join Our Club,\\&quot; \\&quot;Who Do You Think You Are,\\&quot; among others -- they found the heart in nightclubbing. The quality of the music dips slightly in the latter half of the album, but there is prime pop throughout the disc.   AMG\n\n\n01.
