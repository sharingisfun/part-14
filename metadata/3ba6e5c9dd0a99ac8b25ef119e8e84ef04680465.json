Top of the Pops, also known as TOTP, is a music chart television program, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly from 1 January 1964 to 30 July 2006.\n\nEach weekly program consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, every year there was a special edition of the program on Christmas Day featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.\n\n&quot;99 Luftballons&quot; is a protest song by the German singer Nena. Originally sung in German, it was later re-recorded in English as &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot;.\n\n&quot;99 Luftballons&quot; reached #1 in West Germany in 1983. In 1984, the original German version also peaked at #2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart and this English-language version topped the UK Singles Chart. The German version topped the Australian charts for five weeks and the New Zealand charts for one week.\n \nThe translation of the title is sometimes given as &quot;Ninety-Nine Air Balloons&quot;, however &quot;Ninety-Nine Balloons&quot; is also correct. A Luftballon is a colourful toy balloon, rather than a balloon for transport or research.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Luftballons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Luftballons&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaBpaaaDc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaBpaaaDc&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6790kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:42\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
