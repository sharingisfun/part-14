Hurdles befall each of the four: grades, higher aspirations, love. Is it the Foreign Exchange students that learn from their host or the hosts that do more of the learning?\n\n\nIMDB REVIEW:\n\nThis is the first teen movie where all the actors actually are and/or look like teens. If you are looking for a movie with &quot;American Pie&quot; humor, then continue searching, because this movie can not compete with &quot;American Pie&quot; humor. Don't get me wrong, I am not an &quot;American Pie&quot; fan but those movies are WAY more funny then this one.\n\nThis movie does not have any exaggerated scenes, everything you see could have happened for real. So don't expect any &quot;Scary Movie&quot; scenarios.\n\nThere are a few funny lines that I will never forget, like this one &quot;Searching for a good girlfriend is like searching for a good used car, if the oil smells funny, there is something wrong with the vehicle.&quot; I gave this movie a 6 because I didn't laugh once. I smiled a couple of times but that's it. This is not the movie you want to buy, rent it, and only if you like high-school-movies.\n\nSCREENS (Remove 'x' from the links)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i27.tinypic.xcom/4qg8jq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i27.tinypic.xcom/4qg8jq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i25.tinypic.xcom/33fc5rd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i25.tinypic.xcom/33fc5rd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i30.tinypic.xcom/30agew4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i30.tinypic.xcom/30agew4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND BE PATIENT - MY UPLOAD SPEED IS CAPPED AT 40kbps!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0753d4aa7dc6f8346004a727e3bb8feaabb5aaa8","amp;dn":"Foreign+Exchange+2008+DVDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0753d4aa7dc6f8346004a727e3bb8feaabb5aaa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,83,212,170,125,198,248,52,96,4,167,39,227,187,143,234,171,181,170,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
