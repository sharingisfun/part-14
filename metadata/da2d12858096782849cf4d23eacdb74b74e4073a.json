While lacking the sheer breadth and ambition of the previous Being There, Summer Teeth is the most focused Wilco effort yet, honing the lessons of the last record to forge a majestic pop sound almost completely devoid of alt-country elements; the lush string arrangements and gorgeous harmonies of tracks like &quot;She's a Jar&quot; and &quot;Pieholden Suite&quot; suggest nothing less than a landlocked Brian Wilson, while more straightforward rockers like the opening &quot;I Can't Stand It&quot; bear the influence of everything from R&amp;B to psychedelia. Still, for all of the superficial warmth and beauty of the record's arrangements, Tweedy's songs are perhaps his darkest and most haunting to date, bleak domestic dramas informed by recurring themes of alienation, adultery, and abuse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ even the sunniest melodies mask moments of devastating power. If Summer Teeth has a precedent, it's peak-era Band; the album not only possesses a similar pastoral sensibility, but like Robbie Robertson and company before them, Wilco seems directly connected to a kind of American musical consciousness, not only rejuvenating our collective creative mythology, but adding new chapters to the legend with each successive record.\n\n\n\n01  Can't Stand It                          Wilco     3:46\n02  She's a Jar                   Bennett, Tweedy     4:43\n03  A Shot in the Arm   Bennett, Stirratt, Tweedy     4:19\n04  We're Just Friends                      Wilco     2:44\n05  I'm Always in Love                      Wilco     3:41\n06  Nothing'severgonnastandinmyway (Again)  Wilco     3:20\n07  Pieholden Suite                         Wilco     3:26\n08  How to Fight Loneliness                 Wilco     3:53\n09  Via Chicago                             Tweedy    5:33\n10  ELT                                     Wilco     3:46\n11  My Darling                              Wilco     3:38\n12  When You Wake up Feeling Old            Wilco     3:56\n13  Summer Teeth                            Wilco     3:21\n14  In a Future Age                         Wilco     2:57\n15  ...
