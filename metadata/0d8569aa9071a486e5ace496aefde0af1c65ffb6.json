Rabiza and Alexander Repyev (translator)\nMir Publishers | 1987 | ISBN: N/A | PDF | 192 pages | 11.9 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Space-Adventures-Your-Home-Rabiza/dp/0828527857&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Space-Adventures-Your-Home-Rabiza/dp/0828527857&lt;/a&gt;\nscanned to PDF by me.\n\nI have scanned another of my old Mir books. It was first published in Russian in 1978 &amp; translated into English in 1983. This one is based on revised 1984 Russian edition.\nSpace Adventures in Your Home will help you perform experiments on your own. Of course, this book deals not with the outer space, it is concerned with projects involving phenomena relating to space. You can carry them out at home or at a school engineering club. The experiments described are based on the physical laws studied at school. You will find experiments on atmospheric pressure and vacuum, heat, inertia, and weightlessness. You will also enjoy simple trials in spec-tral analysis, will become acquainted with the principles underlying the remote control of model PRV's (planetary roving vehicles), with the land-ing by parachute on Earth of a &quot;descending capsule&quot;, and its soft landing. You will even be able to carry out a &quot;space manoeuvre&quot;-to dock two box kites in the air.\nThis book will help you test your knowledge in practice and take the first steps towards invention. The recommended models are not accom-panied by drawings, since the author wants you to show your enterprise and use any bits and pieces available. To store the materials required to make the exciting things in this book and to perform experiments, find a case with boxes or partitions to contain suitable tools and supplies: bolts, screws, nuts, washers, tubes, wire, empty spools, metal balls, parts of toys, etc., etc.\n\nCONTENTS\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE 9\nExperiments with the Atmosphere and Emptiness 11\nExperiments with Weightlessness 30\nExperiments with Heat 48\nExperiments with Laws of Motion 65\nExperiments with Reaction Motion 85\nPlanet Earth, the Cosmic Top 108\nThrough Boundless Space and Time 124\nOutdoor Experiments 155\nPlanetary Roving\nVehicles on Your Stand 168\nDesigning Cosmic Fantasies 188","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8569aa9071a486e5ace496aefde0af1c65ffb6","amp;dn":"Space+Adventures+in+Your+Home+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8569aa9071a486e5ace496aefde0af1c65ffb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,133,105,170,144,113,164,134,229,172,228,150,174,253,224,175,28,101,255,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
