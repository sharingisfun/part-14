The tagline for the comic, &quot;Life Through Their Eyes,&quot; reflects the predominant theme of the comic, telling a heroic tale of creatures normally viewed only as evil and weak.  The comic often contains scenes of strong violence.\n\nThis torrent includes books 1 through 4 of Thunt's Web comic, &quot;Goblins,&quot; in CBR format.  Book 1 includes comics from 2005 and 2006, book 2 from 2006 and 2007, book 3 from 2007 through 2009, and book 4 from 2009 through 2012.  I haven't included more recent comics as book 5 isn't yet complete.  Note that these are NOT the official e-books; all the comics in this torrent were downloaded directly from the goblinscomic.org Web site","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:240a3003e86907a3a38c5d3da273f4cb5c388bfa","amp;dn":"Goblins+%28Web+Comic%29+-+Books+1+through+4+%7BWebComixFan%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"240a3003e86907a3a38c5d3da273f4cb5c388bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,10,48,3,232,105,7,163,163,140,93,61,162,115,244,203,92,56,139,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
