She's still using everything Bones, her sexy and dangerous ex, taught her, but when Cat is targeted for assassination, the only man who can help her is the vampire she left behind.\n\nBeing around Bones awakens all her emotions, from the adrenaline rush of slaying vamps together, side by side, to the reckless passion that consumed them. But having a price on her head - wanted: dead or half-alive - means her survival depends on teaming up with Bones. And no matter how hard Cat tries to keep things professional between them, she'll find that desire lasts forever . . . and Bones won't let her get away again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3164d3cc94913d76ecb06dc6e5c1c8d51dbbdfad","amp;dn":"Jeaniene+Frost-One+Foot+In+The+Grave","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3164d3cc94913d76ecb06dc6e5c1c8d51dbbdfad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,100,211,204,148,145,61,118,236,176,109,198,229,193,200,213,29,187,223,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
