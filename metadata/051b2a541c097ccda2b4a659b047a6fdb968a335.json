But Ammons's enormous, emotional sound and his fealty to the blues, ballads and deeply-rooted swing remained constants. The two albums collected here were recorded on two consecutive days, less than a month after Ammons's release. On half of the twelve selections he is reunited with an old Chicago friend, pianist Junior Mance, who first recorded with &quot;Jug&quot; in 1947, while elsewhere organist Sonny Phillips and drummer Bernard Purdie (who defined funk drumming in the Sixties) assist Ammons in updating the soul-jazz idiom he helped forge earlier in the decade. Whether on his own hip blues &quot;Ger-Ru,&quot; gorgeous ballads like &quot;I Wonder,&quot; or then-contemporary themes such as &quot;Son of a Preacher Man,&quot; Gene Ammons confirmed that The Boss Is Back!\n\nwith Prince James, Junior Mance, Sonny Phillips, Billy Butler, Bob Bushnell, Buster Williams, Bernard Purdie, Frankie Jones, Candido\n\nRecorded November 10 and 11, 1969.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:051b2a541c097ccda2b4a659b047a6fdb968a335","amp;dn":"Gene+Ammons+-+The+Boss+Is+Back%21+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"051b2a541c097ccda2b4a659b047a6fdb968a335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,27,42,84,28,9,124,205,162,180,166,89,176,71,166,253,185,104,163,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
