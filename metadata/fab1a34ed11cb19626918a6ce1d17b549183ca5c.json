This collection is culled from his past three albums (1988's I'm Your Man, 1992's The Future, and 1994's Cohen Live) and shows a man whose voice has deepened to the point of grim, foreboding death with lyrics sharpened to masterful precision. The arrangements are deliberately clunky--the cheese- whiz female back-ups lend unusual tension bordering on parody--but the sentiments are for real. Two previously unreleased cuts, &quot;Never Any Good&quot; and the non-event, &quot;The Great Event&quot; suggest his well is currently dry. But the unrelenting bleakness of &quot;The Future&quot; and uneasy celebration of &quot;Democracy&quot; are among the past decade's most challenging pop works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab1a34ed11cb19626918a6ce1d17b549183ca5c","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+More+Best+Of+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab1a34ed11cb19626918a6ce1d17b549183ca5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,177,163,78,209,28,177,150,38,145,138,108,225,209,123,84,145,131,202,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
