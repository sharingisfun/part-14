Scheer had concluded that it is technically and environmentally feasible to harness enough solar radiation to achieve a total replacement of the foclear (fossil/nuclear) energy system by a global renewable energy economy. The main obstacle to such a change is seen to be political, not technical or economic.[2] In 1999 he was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs that were the major source of the rise of renewable energies in Germany during the following years.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9bb9be559b5e280d2c1b3af8db1a93bb115b0f9","amp;dn":"The+Energy+Imperative+%282010%29+Herman+Scheer+-+German+Solar+Leader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9bb9be559b5e280d2c1b3af8db1a93bb115b0f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,187,155,229,89,181,226,128,210,193,179,175,141,177,169,59,177,21,176,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
