It is the first Stones compilation that tries to be comprehensive and logical -- for all their attributes, the two Hot Rocks sets and the two Big Hits collections didn't present the singles in chronological order. In essence, the previous compilations were excellent samplers, where Singles Collection tells most of the story (certain albums, like Aftermath, Beggars Banquet, and Let It Bleed, fill in the gaps left by the singles). The Rolling Stones made genuine albums -- even their early R&amp;B/blues albums were impeccably paced -- but their singles had a power all their own, which is quite clearly illustrated by the Singles Collection. By presenting the singles in chronological order, the set takes on a relentless, exhilarating pace with each hit and neglected B-side piling on top of each other, adding a new dimension to the group; it has a power it wouldn't have had if it tried to sample from the albums. Although it cheats near the end, adding singles from the Metamorphosis outtakes collection and two singles from Sticky Fingers, this captures the essence of the '60s Stones as well as any compilation could. Casual fans might want to stick with the Hot Rocks sets, since they just have the hits, but for those that want a little bit more, the Singles Collection is absolutely essential.\n\n\nArtist...............: The Rolling Stones\nAlbum................: Singles Collection The London Years Box Set\nGenre................: Classic Rock\nSource...............: CD {SACD Hybrid ABKCO/Universal UICY-93035/6/7}\nYear.................: 2006\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: Digitally Remastered Original Recordings\n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/17/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front, Back, CD, Booklet\n\n\n\nTracklisting\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Come On\n02.I Want To Be Loved\n03.I Wanna Be Your Man\n04.Stoned\n05.Not Fade Away\n06.Little By Little\n07.It's All Over Now\n08.Good Times, Bad Times\n09.Tell Me\n10.I Just Want To Make Love To You\n11.Time Is On My Side\n12.Congratulations\n13.Little Red Rooster\n14.Off The Hook\n15.Heart Of Stone\n16.What A Shame\n17.The Last Time\n18.Play With Fire\n19.(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\n20.The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man\n21.The Spider And The Fly\n22.Get Off Of My Cloud\n23.I'm Free\n24.The Singer Not The Song\n25.As Tears Go By\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Gotta Get Away\n02.19th Nervous Breakdown\n03.Sad Day\n04.Paint It, Black\n05.Stupid Girl\n06.Long Long While\n07.Mother's Little Helper\n08.Lady Jane\n09.Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing In The Shadow\n10.Who's Driving Your Plane\n11.Let's Spend The Night Together\n12.Ruby Tuesday\n13.We Love You\n14.Dandelion\n15.She's A Rainbow\n16.2000 Light Years From Home\n17.In Another Land\n18.The Lantern\n19.Jumpin' Jack Flash\n20.Child Of The Moon (RMK)\n\n\nCD3\n\n01.Street Fighting Man\n02.No Expectations\n03.Surprise, Surprise\n04.Honky Tonk Women\n05.You Can't Always Get What You Want\n06.Memo From Turner\n07.Brown Sugar\n08.Wild Horses\n09.I Don't Know Why aka Don't Know Why I Love You\n10.Try A Little Harder\n11.Out Of Time\n12.Jiving Sister Fanny\n13.Sympathy For The Devil\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcf99bc429cc958503973a626cd250935d573000","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-Singles+Collection+2006++FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcf99bc429cc958503973a626cd250935d573000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,249,155,196,41,204,149,133,3,151,58,98,108,210,80,147,93,87,48,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
