The resulting, aptly named Songs of Patience is a visceral yet carefully honed backslap of a record that sneaks up on you like a predator, then buys you a drink rather than tearing your throat out.   More mid-'90s alternative rock than 21st century indie rock, Songs of Patience will resonate with fans of earthy yet cosmic college rock staples like Grant Lee Buffalo and Mercury Rev, but it owes a great deal to current rustbelt crooners like My Morning Jacket and Band of Horses as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5114465e37abde7940d157b8f0762bd64a28f059","amp;dn":"Alberta+Cross+-+Songs+of+Patience+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5114465e37abde7940d157b8f0762bd64a28f059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,20,70,94,55,171,222,121,64,209,87,184,240,118,43,214,74,40,240,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
