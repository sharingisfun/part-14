Since all essential aspects of detective work cannot be covered in a single volume, the editors have selected 20 of the most critical issues detectives face in their day-to-day work and present them in separate chapters.\n\nUsing a unique format and style, this essential handbook draws on the expertise of contributors with police and academic backgrounds to provide both new and seasoned detectives with invaluable insights. It covers a wide range of detective procedures and practices employed in the United States and can be read as a whole or used as a reference for conducting various types of investigations and interrogations.\n\nThe book highlights common mistakes and outlines best practices to help readers avoid making the same mistakes in the field. It provides the tools and understanding to conduct the range of investigations that todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s detectives will most likely have to conduct, including those involving sexual predators, healthcare and financial fraud, cyber crime, gangs, cults, personal violence, and property.\n\nThe text concludes with a section on all-purpose practices and lessons for investigations. In this section, readers will learn the practical aspects of interviewing and interrogating witnesses, including how to interview and communicate with special populations, such as those with mental and physical disabilities.\n\nSharing the most effective investigative practices and procedures in use today, this book is a must-have for police, sheriffs, and other government agencies that are responsible for protecting the public","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e1a2f29a2e8f89ad1f69eb65d03a28d08f990b3","amp;dn":"The+Detective%27s+Handbook+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e1a2f29a2e8f89ad1f69eb65d03a28d08f990b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,26,47,41,162,232,248,154,209,246,158,182,93,3,162,141,8,249,144,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
