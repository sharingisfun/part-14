In an age when scientists are excited by discovering a new kind of tube worm, the thought of finding and naming a new large terrestrial mammal is astonishing, and wildlife biologists from all over the world are flocking to this dangerous region. The result is a race between preservation and destruction.\n\nContaining research gathered from famous biologists, conservationists, indigenous peoples, former POWs, ex-Viet Cong, and the first U.S. ambassador to Vietnam since the war's end, Gold Rush in the Jungle goes deep into the valleys, hills, and hollows of Vietnam to explore the research, the international trade in endangered species, the lingering effects of Agent Orange, and the effort of a handful of biologists to save the world's rarest animals.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nePub: 298 pages\nPublisher: Crown; 1St Edition edition (April 16, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307407047\nISBN-13: 978-0307407047\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e15d5ac8c1120eeb7938bf77670a2da0c4128b8","amp;dn":"Gold+Rush+in+the+Jungle%3A+The+Race+to+Discover+and+Defend+the+Rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e15d5ac8c1120eeb7938bf77670a2da0c4128b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,21,213,172,140,17,32,238,183,147,139,247,118,112,162,218,12,65,40,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
