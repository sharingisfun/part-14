Flynn's classic work from 1944 on how wartime planning brought fascism to America. Flynn was a prominent journalist and rare case of an American public intellectual who resisted the onslaught of both the warfare and welfare states during the period in which FDR ruled America. This study links the domestic policy of the New Deal with the drive for war and wartime central planning. He draws attention to the bitter irony that America was becoming precisely what we were fighting. His analysis of fascism is incisive and devastating.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/As-We-Marching-John-Flynn/dp/B000WTXMBS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373085961&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=as+we+go+marching&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/As-We-Marching-John-Flynn/dp/B000WTXMBS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373085961&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=as+we+go+marching&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fff055b88a04a3cd1610a52512b4adc94ec97d13","amp;dn":"As+We+Go+Marching+%281944%29+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fff055b88a04a3cd1610a52512b4adc94ec97d13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,240,85,184,138,4,163,205,22,16,165,37,18,180,173,201,78,201,125,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
