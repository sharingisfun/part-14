They drive vehicles, use machinery, and\nlive in amazing castles and forts. But make no mistake about it: these are animals,\nwith claws, fangs, tails, and sometimes wings. And now they are engaged in a full\nscale conflict. Once a pristine, natural paradise, the land of CHIMA has become a\nbattle ground for the animal tribes. Best friends are now worst enemies. Weaponry\npummels the once-sacred temples. Animalistic vehicles charge furiously at each other\nin jungle jousts. The animals fight for control of a natural resource called CHI, a\npower that is both a source of life and holds the potential for destruction. Only a\nfew brave heroes in CHIMA understand the true nature of CHI and its importance.\nTheir stories, and the stories of those who seek to conquer the CHI, are known as...\nTHE LEGENDS OF CHIMA.\n\nProduced by M2Film and The LEGO Group.\n\n\nSaddened to see his father distraught over the loss of the Map and his best friend\nTormak, Flinx boldly sneaks off to confront Sir Fangar on his own. But he falls\ninto a clever trap. King Fluminox who has now lost his son, too, can no longer\nstay above the fray. Laval, Eris and Cragger joins him a daring rescue in the\nflying Phoenix Blazing Bastion... but yet another trap awaits.\n\nLEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S02E18.The.Phoenix.Has.Landed.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-YFN\n\nFormat: Matroska Video File (MKV)\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1916x1076 23.976fps\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:22:03\nFile size: 832 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f03653edd09325a9da4d04d530a77f42d717f6","amp;dn":"LEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S02E18.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-YFN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f03653edd09325a9da4d04d530a77f42d717f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,240,54,83,237,208,147,37,169,218,77,4,213,48,167,127,66,215,23,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
