Sporting a hit soundtrack of contemporary pop-rock songs (licensing of which delayed the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s video release until 1996), the film also benefited from an extraordinary symphonic score by Elmer Bernstein which did the lionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s share of the musical storytelling. (Bernstein was, at the time, the regular composer for producer Ivan Reitman.)\n\nTo put it simply, Heavy Metal is Elmer BernsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Star WarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a rich, vital, thunderingly symphonic work bursting with melody and drive. The anthology nature of the film allowed Bernstein to write distinct melodies for the disparate segments: from the heroic anthem of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the moody film noir stylings of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHarry Canyon,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and, especially, the soaring chorus and ondes Martenot of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTaarnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the latter adapting the composerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rejected love theme from Saturn III (1980).\n\nHeavy Metal: The Score has long been desired by soundtrack collectors. FSM releases not only the original LP but the complete score remastered from the composerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal 1/4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ stereo tapes (in excellent sound quality). The cues are presented in chronological order, with bonus tracks of selections edited for the 1981 Asylum Records LPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½meaning listeners can, if so inclined, program a recreation of the original album sequence.\n\n\n\n\nTracks\n01.
