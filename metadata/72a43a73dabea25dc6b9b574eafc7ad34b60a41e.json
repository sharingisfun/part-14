Although it appears to be a book, in reality it was a, &quot;special issue&quot; of the magazine and as such it was sold on newsstands.  On the cover it is described as, &quot;A never before published history of the comics.&quot;  It is also described as, &quot;An Adult Comic&quot;.  It was not an anthology; it was a collection of original material written by the Lampoon's regular contributors especially for the book.  It was edited by Sean Kelly.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a43a73dabea25dc6b9b574eafc7ad34b60a41e","amp;dn":"National+Lampoon+Presents+The+Very+Large+Book+Of+Comical+Funnies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a43a73dabea25dc6b9b574eafc7ad34b60a41e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,164,58,115,218,190,162,93,198,185,181,116,234,252,122,211,75,96,164,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
