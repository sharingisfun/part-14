They scored a hit off their self titled album, with &quot;Race with the Devil&quot;, issued as a single in October 1968. A fan of the song Jimi Hendrix performed it at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, although no recordings appear to exist. Unfortunately they were unable to score any other hits, despite other singles such as &quot;Drives You Mad&quot;. Their debut album is also noteworthy for the cover art, the first album art done by artist Roger Dean. Their second album, Gun Sight, was a flop producing no hits but included tracks such as, &quot;Long Haired Wildman&quot; and &quot;Drown Yourself In the River&quot;. However the lack of schlagers led to the band's end leaving the Gurvitz brothers free to go to work with Ginger Baker the former drummer for Cream as, The Baker Gurvitz Army.\n\n&quot;Race With the Devil&quot; has been covered by Judas Priest (on the remastered CD version of Sin After Sin), Black Oak Arkansas (on their album Race With the Devil) and Girlschool (on their album Demolition).\n\nLineup\nAdrian Gurvitz - Guitars - Vocals\nPaul Gurvitz - Bass\nLois Farrell - Drums\n\nTrack List\n01 - Race With The Devil\n02 - The Sad Saga Of The Boy And The Bee\n03 - Rupert's Travels\n04 - Yellow Cab Man\n05 - It Won't Be Long (Heartbeat)\n06 - Sunshine\n07 - Rat Race\n08 - Take Off\n09 - Drives You Mad (Bonus)\n10 - Don't Look Back (Bonus)\n11 - Runnin' Wild (Bonus)\nRunningtime: 47:45 min\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbac4075e12620942762071e5be123051098d0fd","amp;dn":"Gun+-+Gun+%5B1968%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbac4075e12620942762071e5be123051098d0fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,172,64,117,225,38,32,148,39,98,7,30,91,225,35,5,16,152,208,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
