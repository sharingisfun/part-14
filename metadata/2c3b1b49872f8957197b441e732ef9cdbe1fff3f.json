Are Percy and Annabeth up to the task of rescuing stolen goods from a fire-breathing giant who doesn't take kindly to intruders? How exactly are Leo, Piper, and Jason supposed to find a runaway table, dodge a band of party-loving Maenads&quot; (&quot;who just might be a little psychotic), and stave off a massive explosion...all in one hour or less? \nWith his trademark wit and creativity, Rick Riordan answers these questions and more in three never-before-seen short stories that provide vital back-story to the Heroes of Olympus and Percy Jackson books. Original art, enlightening character interviews and profiles, puzzles, and a quiz add to the fun in this action-packed collection.\n\n\n*A story from Luke Castellan's point of view, from the days when he adventured with Thalia and Annabeth. Many people have asked me to write an adventure prequel to The Lightning Thief. Here it is!\n\n*A classic first-person Percy Jackson story, the first I've written since The Last Olympian. In this adventure, Annabeth and Percy's date is interrupted by the god Hermes, whose staff has been stolen by a fire-breathing giant. This cannot be good . . .\n\n*A Leo Valdez story, set at Camp Half-Blood. As Leo builds the Argo II, something goes terribly wrong. Now Leo will need the help of Piper and Jason, or the entire camp might be destroyed.\n\n*And, as announced on Rock Center, the anthology includes a debut short story from my son Haley. Since Haley inspired the entire Percy Jackson series, it seemed only right that I asked him to contribute his own original spin on Percy's world for this book. I was amazed at what Haley came up with. His brother Patrick, who's a tough editor, was quick to say, &quot;Dad, his story is better than yours!&quot; Haley ponders the question: &quot;What happened to the demigods who fought with Kronos's army after the battle in Manhattan?&quot; This is the story of one such demigod, and I have to admit, some of Haley's ideas are so good I wish I'd come up with them!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c3b1b49872f8957197b441e732ef9cdbe1fff3f","amp;dn":"The+Demigod+Diaries+%28Heroes+of+Olympus%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c3b1b49872f8957197b441e732ef9cdbe1fff3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,59,27,73,135,47,137,87,25,123,68,30,115,46,249,205,190,31,255,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
