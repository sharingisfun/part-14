The applications work in their own virtual environment and do not affect the operating system or other programs.\n\nAmongst other features, this technology allows multiple identical applications to be run in parallel on the same system. This enables you to simultaneously run different versions of a browser on a system, for example. Outdated applications can be used on new and modern operating systems.\nA problem with non-virtualized applications is that they are firmly anchored to the system. The installation and configuration of applications is time-consuming. Uninstalling will not delete entries in the registry or file system and thus will put further strain on the system. This can lead to system slow-downs and crashes.\nVirtualized applications, however, are flexible. These can be run locally on a PC, on network drives, on terminal servers or on USB sticks. Evalaze also puts an application virtualization assistant at the user's disposal to help with the software. In order to virtualize an application, Evalaze creates a snapshot of the system. Following this, the application of choice is installed and a second snapshot is taken. The installed files and registry entries are now converted into a new .exe file by Evalazs's virtualization engine. This file can now be copied to an appropriate medium and executed.\n\n\n\nEvalaze-Features\n\nEvalaze is cross-platform compatible with all 32 Bit/64-Bit operating systems like Windows XP (SP2), Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as with servers running Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2008.\n\n32-Bit/64-Bit Supports applications for 64-Bit Windows systems.\n\nA software 'assistant' guides the user through the virtualization of applications.\n\nDuring the process of creating the virtualized application there is a choice as to whether or not the sandbox will be automatically deleted each time the application is shut down. If so, the virtual application would automatically reset to its original state.\n\nThe start-up screen can be customised to the user's needs and wishes. This is ideal for software developers.\n\nThe virtualized application does not need drivers, clients, or a server environment, as it runs completely independently.\n\nThe system stays clean. A virtualized application is copied. If it is no longer required it can simply be deleted. It will leave no traces.\n\nEach virtualized application and any other elements will run in the same virtual environment.\n\nThe virtual application runs entirely in user mode. Therefore, no administrator rights are required.\n\nThe application is launched in a sandbox. This completely isolates the application from the operating system and any other applications.\n\nBusiness clients can take advantage of a simple licensing model and can now use Evalaze within their own IT environments.\n\n\n\nRecommendations for the Capture System:\n\n  Windows XP as a physical or virtual machine; We recommend a newly set-up operating system on a virtual machine\n   Microsoft .NET Framework version 2.0 or higher\n   The requirements for the system and hardware are that they must be at least equivalent to the virtualized application being created. Evalaze requires at least 256 MB of RAM memory\n   15MB hard disk space and at least four times the space taken up by the application to be virtualized.\n\nThe second type of system is called the target system. This system is called the operating environment in which the virtualized application will run.\n\nRecommendations for the Target System:\n\n   System and hardware requirements are at least equal to those of the virtualized application\n   Windows XP or later; Windows Server 2003 or later\n\n\nRecommendations for the Virtualization of Applications:\n\nInstall Windows followed by .NET Framework 2.0 on a virtual machine. Do not perform any additional installations as these could affect the virtualization process. Copy Evalaze onto the system and launch it to adjust any settings as necessary. Then quit Evalaze and you will obtain a snapshot of the entire virtual machine in a clean state.\nAfter the virtualization of an application has been carried out, you can reopen the snapshot and use it to reset the virtual machine back to a clean condition.\n\nVirtual Box, VMware Workstation or MS Virtual PC (XP Mode in Windows 7) can be used effectively to create virtual machines.\n\n\n\n\n[Installation]\n\n      Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  UnZip\n\n\n      Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Use DVT KeyfileMaker to generate your Product Validation Code\n\n\n      Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Now you can run the Evalaze.Commercial.Edition setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
