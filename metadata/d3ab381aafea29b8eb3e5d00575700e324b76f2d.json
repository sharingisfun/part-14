It was released on November 24, 2014. The album is a collection of rarities, live tracks, and unreleased material spanning the group's history. It includes previously released songs, such as &quot;Live to Rise&quot;, &quot;Black Rain&quot;, &quot;Birth Ritual&quot;, and others, as well as a newly recorded rendition of a song from the band's pre-Matt Cameron 1985 demo, &quot;The Storm&quot;, now simply titled &quot;Storm&quot;, which was produced by Jack Endino.\n\nWhile almost fully comprehensive, there are some notable absentees from this compilation: &quot;Incessant Mace&quot; from 1985's Pyrrhic Victory compilation cassette (with Chris Cornell on drums), &quot;Heretic&quot; and &quot;Tears to Forget&quot; from 1986's Deep Six compilation (with Scott Sundquist on drums - note that &quot;All Your Lies&quot; from this compilation was previously released on 2010's Telephantasm), and a re-recording of &quot;New Damage&quot; featuring Brian May from 1993's Alternative NRG compilation.\n\nKim Thayil has also mentioned in past interviews that there are more unreleased tracks that still haven't seen the light of day, including tracks like &quot;Dirty Candy&quot;, &quot;Ocean Fronts&quot;, &quot;Open Up&quot;, &quot;Summation&quot;, &quot;Beast&quot; and &quot;No Shame&quot;. None of these tracks are on Echo of Miles, despite the fact that Thayil has expressed that he wanted to release a b-sides compilation featuring these tracks.\n\nContents\nTrack listing\n\nDisc one - Originals\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Sub Pop Rock City&quot; (Sub Pop 200 compilation) \t3:15\n2. \t&quot;Toy Box&quot; (Flower single b-side) \t5:42\n3. \t&quot;Heretic&quot; (Hands All Over single b-side &amp; Loudest Love EP) \t3:50\n4. \t&quot;Fresh Deadly Roses&quot; (Loud Love single b-side &amp; Loudest Love EP) \t4:51\n5. \t&quot;HIV Baby&quot; (Room a Thousand Years Wide single b-side) \t4:51\n6. \t&quot;Cold Bitch&quot; (Spoonman single b-side) \t4:59\n7. \t&quot;Show Me&quot; (Rusty Cage single b-side &amp; No Alternative compilation) \t2:46\n8. \t&quot;She's a Politician&quot; (Satanoscillatemymetallicsonatas EP &amp; Burden in My Hand single b-side) \t1:46\n9. \t&quot;Birth Ritual&quot; (Singles soundtrack &amp; Telephantasm) \t6:03\n10. \t&quot;She Likes Surprises&quot; (International version of Superunknown &amp; Songs from the Superunknown EP) \t3:18\n11. \t&quot;Kyle Petty, Son of Richard&quot; (Fell on Black Days single b-side, &amp; Home Alive: the Art of Self Defense compilation) \t4:04\n12. \t&quot;Exit Stonehenge&quot; (Spoonman single b-side) \t1:19\n13. \t&quot;Blind Dogs&quot; (The Basketball Diaries soundtrack) \t4:40\n14. \t&quot;Bleed Together&quot; (Burden in My Hand single b-side &amp; A-Sides) \t3:53\n15. \t&quot;Black Rain&quot; (Telephantasm) \t5:24\n16. \t&quot;Live to Rise&quot; (The Avengers soundtrack) \t4:40\n17. \t&quot;Kristi&quot; (Previously unreleased) \t5:32\n18. \t&quot;Storm&quot; (Previously unreleased) \t5:25\n\nTotal length:\n\t1:17:00 \t\n\nDisc two - Covers\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Swallow My Pride&quot; (Fopp EP) \t2:22\n2. \t&quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; (Ultramega OK) \t5:10\n3. \t&quot;Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey (John Peel Sessions)&quot; (Previously unreleased) \t2:27\n4. \t&quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) (John Peel Sessions)&quot; (Previously unreleased) \t5:07\n5. \t&quot;Come Together&quot; (Hands All Over single b-side &amp; Loudest Love EP) \t5:54\n6. \t&quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; (Satanoscillatemymetallicsonatas EP &amp; Jesus Christ Pose single b-side) \t4:41\n7. \t&quot;Into the Void (Sealth)&quot; (Satanoscillatemymetallicsonatas EP &amp; Jesus Christ Pose single b-side) \t6:38\n8. \t&quot;Girl U Want&quot; (Satanoscillatemymetallicsonatas EP &amp; Fell on Black Days single b-side) \t3:30\n9. \t&quot;Touch Me&quot; (Rusty Cage single b-side) \t2:51\n10. \t&quot;Can You See Me?
