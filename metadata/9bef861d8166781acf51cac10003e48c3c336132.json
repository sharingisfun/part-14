Captain Shiner\n\nBy now, Primus' modus operandi is clear and well-established: twisted bass/drum grooves \n\nreminiscent of King Crimson gone horribly, horribly wrong, insane ringmaster vocals \n\nwith cartoonish lyrics, and cutting, off-the-wall guitar. There is much unabashed prog \n\nrock in Primus' sound, which even the thick dollops of irony that the band seeks to \n\nimpart to its compositions are unable to mask completely. Primus' musicianship \n\ncontinues to improve, with the intonation of Les Claypool's trademark fretless bass (a \n\nsore spot in the past) more spot-on than ever, and guitarist Larry LaLonde's Fripp-isms \n\nare truly convincing for the first time. The funk influences that have always been \n\nhinted at on previous Primus records seem more convincing here, as Claypool and drummer \n\nTim &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander lay down some extremely grooving figures, as on the Red Hot Chili \n\nPeppers-esque &quot;chorus&quot; to &quot;Mrs. Blaileen.&quot; Of course, the high-energy angular rhythms \n\nthat Primus is known and loved for are as present as ever; they are just pulled off \n\nwith greater zest and looser precision (if there is such a thing) than they have in the \n\npast. LaLonde in particular seems to have improved a great deal between Pork Soda and \n\nTales From the Punchbowl. His dissonances seem a bit more calculated and less \n\ngratuitous and lazy than they often came off before. With high energy and full of surprises, Tales From the Punchbowl is one of Primus' finer discs.\n\n[b]Rating:[/b]\n\n4 Stars\n\n[b]Release Date:[/b]\n\nMay 23, 1995\n\n[b]Recording Date:[/b]\n\nNov 1994-Mar 1995\n\n[b]Label:[/b]\n\nInterscope\n\n[b]Genre:[/b]\n\nFunk Metal\n\n[b]Bitrate:[/b]\n\n128kbps\n\n[b]File format:[/b]\n\nmp3\n\n[b]File size:[/b]\n\n49.5 MB\n\n[b]Tracker name/Information:[/b]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://inferno.demonoid.com:3389/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://inferno.demonoid.com:3389/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.sladinki007.net:6500/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.sladinki007.net:6500/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ddram.kicks-ass.net:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ddram.kicks-ass.net:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.prq.to/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.prq.to/announce&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bef861d8166781acf51cac10003e48c3c336132","amp;dn":"Primus+-+Tales+From+The+Punchbowl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bef861d8166781acf51cac10003e48c3c336132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,239,134,29,129,102,120,26,207,81,202,193,0,3,228,140,60,51,97,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
