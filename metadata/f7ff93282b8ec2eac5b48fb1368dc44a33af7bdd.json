The author didn?t invent vampires, but his novel has so\ncaptured the public?s imagination that he is rightly considered their\npopularizer. Listen and you will meet not only the Count himself, but\nheroes Jonathan Harker and Abraham Van Helsing, plus an array of\nmadmen, psychiatrists, and fair maidens who cross paths with the\nfanged menace.
