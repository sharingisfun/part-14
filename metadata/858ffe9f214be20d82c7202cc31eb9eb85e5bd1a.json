Then print the DVD Cover and DVD Inlay Booklet (oh yes\nyou get this too).\n\nI noticed that some of the colour versions are slightly shorter\nthan the B&amp;W versions.  In Brats, for example, you'll see that\nsome small scenes were cut out of the colour version and so is\nshorter than the restored B&amp;W version.  Brats is on DVD Vol 5.\nNote that colourised versions are not as sharp as the B&amp;W versions,\nalthough this is normal if you've ever seen a L&amp;H colourised\nversion before.\n\n\nIncase you missed it, the URL to Vol 1 is... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3427416&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3427416&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEstimated arrival of Vol 3:    w/c 30/01/06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:858ffe9f214be20d82c7202cc31eb9eb85e5bd1a","amp;dn":"Laurel+and+Hardy+DVD+Vol+2+%28of+21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"858ffe9f214be20d82c7202cc31eb9eb85e5bd1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,143,254,159,33,75,226,13,130,199,32,44,195,30,185,235,133,229,189,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
