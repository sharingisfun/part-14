The album is a collection of songs written for award winning theatre company Vanishing Point's futuristic update of John Gay's 18th Century classic which the band toured Britain in last year. The final track features vocals from Brooklyn based art-rockers Maxi Geil &amp; Playcolt front man Guy Smit. The show was a spectacle, pitched somewhere between a gig and a play. It courted much controversy in the theatre world, dividing the critics and reviews ranged from 1-5 stars. Britain s best selling crime author and Rebus creator Ian Rankin has written sleevenotes for the album and the band have three tracks featured on forthcoming BBC3 drama Lip Service out this Autumn. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6b60ba7128ac142756f61b7d971e9a9eff5ce9","amp;dn":"A+Band+Called+Quinn...The+Beggars+Opera%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6b60ba7128ac142756f61b7d971e9a9eff5ce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,107,96,186,113,40,172,20,39,86,246,27,125,151,30,154,158,255,92,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
