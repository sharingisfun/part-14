John gives a technical explanation and instructions on how to construct it.  It does have a lot of useless dialog that could have been better spent on construction notes but is still a good video.  Also has video of the original announcement from a 1984 free energy conference.\n\nNOTE:  When played, the avi gives a popup &quot;AVI Chunk Converter&quot; which happens when the AVI file's footer was not closed correctly. This is not spy/mal/scareware.  Just close the popup and build it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1513e6deb72584a83647efacc388068035466abd","amp;dn":"Energy+From+The+Vacuum+-+Part+10+%28Kromrey+Converter%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1513e6deb72584a83647efacc388068035466abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,19,230,222,183,37,132,168,54,71,239,172,195,136,6,128,53,70,106,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
