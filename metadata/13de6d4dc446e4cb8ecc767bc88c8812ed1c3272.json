Asuna spends her solitary days listening to the mysterious music emanating from the cat's-whisker receiver her father gave to her as a memento.\n\nOne day, while walking to her clubhouse across a bridge, she is attacked by a fearsome creature and saved by a mysterious boy who calls himself Shun. Shun tells Asuna not to come back but she returns the following day to find Shun expecting her. Asuna treats Shun's wound from fighting the creature and later they both listen to Asuna's radio. Shun tells Asuna he is from another country called Agartha and that he came to this place to find something. He then gives Asuna a blessing in the form of a kiss to the forehead. Asuna, shocked at this, leaves hurriedly and tells Shun she'll be back tomorrow. Shun, now alone, looks at the stars and tries to reach them but falls from the ledge to his death.\n\nInfo:\nAudio: Eng/jap\nSubs:Eng\nQuality: Medium/High\nFormat: .mkv\nSize: 300MB+\nType: Movie\nEncoder: Frozen_Solid [F-D]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13de6d4dc446e4cb8ecc767bc88c8812ed1c3272","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5D_Children_Who_Chase_Lost_Voices_from_Deep_Below_%5B480P%5D%5BDual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13de6d4dc446e4cb8ecc767bc88c8812ed1c3272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,222,109,77,196,70,228,203,142,204,118,123,200,140,136,18,237,28,50,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
