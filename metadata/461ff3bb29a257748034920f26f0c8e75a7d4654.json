In my bundle yesterday, I mentioned that I would be willing to torrent all of those 2014 albums I had uploaded to Christian Tunes.  So far, there doesn't appear to be much interest in me doing so.\n\nBut I will throw it out there one more time because I was just asked for &quot;For King And Country&quot;, an album shared on Christian Tunes and not here on The Pirate Bay.  After today's bundle, I have 158 more 2014 titles which I can torrent here on The Pirate Bay for anyone interested.  But only if there is interest for me to do so.  Otherwise we will leave those 158 albums behind, and move on with new music as it drops.\n\nThat being said, if anyone has downloaded any of these albums, and wish to help me seed here, please do so.  For those unsure how, it's pretty basic.  (1) create a folder called &quot;2014 - The Year In Christian Music (Bundle 50)&quot; in the same folder where your torrents are usually downloaded to.  (2) copy and paste your downloaded music into that folder.  (3) then download the torrent as you normally would.  Your torrent client will recognize that you already have some of these albums, and instead of a downloader, you will be recognized as an uploader for those albums you copied over.\n\nThere are 35 titles in today's bundle...\n\n * Alberto And Kimberly Rivera - 2014 - Burden - Single\n * Alberto And Kimberly Rivera - 2014 - Call Me - Single\n * Alberto And Kimberly Rivera - 2014 - We Are Your Children - Single\n * Alberto And Kimberly Rivera - 2014 - Worthy Of It All - Single\n * Canaan's Crossing - 2014 - Words\n * City On A Hill - 2014 - Covered\n * Fellowship Creative - 2014 - Running To Follow\n * Fellowship Creative - 2014 - The Mix - Get Bright - Single\n * Fellowship Creative - 2014 - The Mix - We Will R.I.O.T\n * For King And Country - 2014 - Run Wild Live Free Love Strong\n * Kerrie Roberts - 2014 - My Heart's Lifted\n * Lecrae - 2014 - Anomaly\n * Lecrae - 2014 - Anomaly - Acapellas\n * Lecrae - 2014 - Anomaly - Instrumentals\n * Lecrae - 2014 - Non-Fiction - Sigle\n * Lecrae - 2014 - Nuthin - Matthew Parker Remix - Single\n * Madison Pillow - 2014 - Story EP\n * Manchester Orchestra - 2014 - Hope\n * Mandisa - 2014 - Get Up - The Remixes\n * Manic Drive - 2014 - VIP - Single\n * Nathan Best - 2014 - Center Of My Life\n * New Wine - 2014 - Spirit Fall\n * Remedy Drive - 2014 - Commodity\n * Robbie Seay Band - 2014 - Psalms EP, Vol 2\n * Robbie Seay Band - 2014 - Psalms EP, Vol 3\n * Shane And Shane - 2014 - The Worship Initiative, Vol 6\n * Shane And Shane - 2014 - The Worship Initiative, Vol 7\n * Shope - 2014 - Don't Let Me Stop - Single\n * Shope - 2014 - Shope EP\n * SPZRKT - 2014 - Bonfire\n * Texas In July - 2014 - Nooses - Single\n * Trip Lee - 2014 - Shweet - Single\n * Trip Lee - 2014 - Sweet Victory - Single\n * Various - 2014 - Simply Instrumental Worship\n * Visible Worship - 2014 - Visible Worship EP\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts, September 2014\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:461ff3bb29a257748034920f26f0c8e75a7d4654","amp;dn":"2014+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+50%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"461ff3bb29a257748034920f26f0c8e75a7d4654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,31,243,187,41,162,87,116,128,52,146,15,38,240,200,231,90,125,70,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
