Writing chiefly for the New York Review of Books and the New Republic, DeÃƒÂ¡k has crafted review essays that cover the breadth and depth of the huge literature on this ominous moment in European history when the survival of democracy and human decency were at stake.\n\nCollected here for the first time, these articles chart changing reactions and analyses by the regimes and populations of Europe and reveal how postwar governments, historians, and ordinary citizens attempt to come to terms withÃ¢â‚¬â€or to evadeÃ¢â‚¬â€the realities of the Holocaust, war, fascism, and resistance movements. They track the acts of scoundrels and the collusion of ordinary citizens in the so-called Final Solution but also show how others in authority and on the street heroically opposed the evil of the day. With its depth, conciseness, and interpretive power, this collection allows readers to consider more clearly and completely than ever before what has been said, how thought has shifted, and what we have learned about these momentous, world-changing events","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66f1dfe9c03918a7f052efd5f2637d2cf99a7c39","amp;dn":"Essays+on+Hitler%27s+Europe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66f1dfe9c03918a7f052efd5f2637d2cf99a7c39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,241,223,233,192,57,24,167,240,82,239,213,242,99,125,44,249,154,124,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
