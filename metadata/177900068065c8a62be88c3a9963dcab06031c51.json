While the album's lyrics dealt with topics such as drug dealers, prostitution, and transvestites, the music itself was seldom dark, and tracks like &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Doctor&quot; and &quot;It's Alright&quot; (the latter sung by drummer Bill WardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a decision supported by Ozzy Osbourne), were very different from Black Sabbath's earlier recordings. Also, the band continued experimenting with keyboards and synthesizers more so than previous albums. The track &quot;She's Gone&quot; features orchestrations.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:177900068065c8a62be88c3a9963dcab06031c51","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+%5C%27Technical+Ecstasy%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"177900068065c8a62be88c3a9963dcab06031c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,121,0,6,128,101,200,166,43,232,140,58,153,99,220,171,6,3,28,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
