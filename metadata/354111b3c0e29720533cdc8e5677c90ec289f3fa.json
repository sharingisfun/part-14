Chad Stuart (born in Windemere, England, on December 10, 1941) and Jeremy Clyde (born March 22, 1941, in Buckinghamshire, England) met while attending London's Central School of Speech and Drama. The two became fast friends, and after Stuart taught Clyde to play guitar, they formed a folk duo as well as a rock &amp; roll group, the Jerks. Because he graduated a year ahead of his bandmates, Clyde relocated to Scotland and performed with the Dundee Repertory Theatre. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifyxqw5ldfe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifyxqw5ldfe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThe average person remembers Chad &amp; Jeremy only for their 1964 hit &quot;A Summer Song&quot; and their appearance on The Dick Van Dyke Show. Actually, that's not entirely true: the average person always confuses Chad &amp; Jeremy with the much more commercially successful Peter &amp; Gordon. This 1990 compilation, however, focuses entirely on the duo's later material for Columbia Records. Though these 20 songs are entirely hit-free, most of them are sublime light psychedelia, soft pop with orchestral flourishes that ranks with the best material the Association, the Millennium, or Harpers Bizarre were doing at the same time. Drawing heavily from their final two albums, 1967's Of Cabbages &amp; Kings and 1968's The Ark, both of which are justifiably prized by collectors, Painted Dayglow Smile also includes a handful of singles (including the cult favorite &quot;Teenage Failure&quot; and the trippy-creepy title track) and alternate takes. Occasional blunders like the Righteous Brothers sound-alike &quot;I Don't Wanna Lose You Baby&quot; and the preachy &quot;Editorial&quot; (a segment pulled from the lengthy &quot;The Progress Suite&quot; off Of Cabbages &amp; Kings) aside, this set is beautifully sung, well-written, and sublimely arranged sunshine pop.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
