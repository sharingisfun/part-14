Its name was inspired by the Celtic Frost album To Mega Therion. &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; is Greek for &quot;The Great Beast&quot; and was a title used by Occultist Aleister Crowley. Originally a death metal band, Therion adjusted its musical style by adding orchestral elements, including choirs, classical musicians, and even a full Orchestra at their concert performances. As a result, it has popularized the Symphonic metal genre. In their biography, they state they have been cited as &quot;the most adventurous Metal band at present\n\nTherion takes its themes from different mythologies and practices, including occultism, magic and ancient traditions and writings. Thomas Karlsson, the head and founder of the magical order Dragon Rouge, has provided lyrics for the band since 1996\n\nTherion draws its influences from several different bands. Its former name Megatherion comes from Celtic Frost's 1985 album To Mega Therion and much of its music prior to Theli was inspired by the 1987 album Into the Pandemonium as well as Uli Jon Roth's Beyond the Astral Skies. For Theli, the band drew from Pink Floyd's album Atom Heart Mother and progressive rock group Klaatu's album Hope.\n\nFrom Vovin onwards, the band has drawn inspiration from classical composers like Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, heavy metal acts from the 1980s like Accept and Iron Maiden, 1970s hard rock bands such as Uriah Heep and &quot;tons of progressive 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s bands that nobody knows anymore these days\n\nArtist: Therion\nGenre: Death Metal (early), Symphonic/Operatic Metal (later)\nLyrical themes: Mythology, Occultism, Ancient religions\nOrigin: Stockholm, Sweden\nCurrent label: Nuclear Blast\nYear: 1988-present\nQuality: avg. bitrate: 320kbps\n\n\n\nCurrent lineup\n\n\n\nChristofer Johnsson Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitars, keyboards, programing, Hammond organ, orchestral arrangement (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent), vocals (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006. 2011-)\nThomas VikstrÃƒÂ¶m Ã¢â‚¬â€ lead vocals (2007-2009 (touring), 2009-present (studio))\nNalle &quot;Grizzly&quot; PÃƒÂ¥hlsson Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass guitar (2008Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nJohan Koleberg Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums (2008Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nChristian Vidal Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitar (2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nLori Lewis Ã¢â‚¬â€ vocals (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent (official member), 2010-present (studio appearances), 2007-2014 (touring))\n\n\n\nSTUDIO ALBUMS\n\n\nOf Darkness...
