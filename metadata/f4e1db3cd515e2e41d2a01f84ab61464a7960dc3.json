Most Zen masters refuse to discuss the discipline or explain it. Hubert Benoit takes the opposite, and for the intellectually-inclined seeker, the more accessible path, and discusses Zen in exhaustive detail in terms of psychology and philosophy\nBenoit writes at an extremely high level of abstraction (something quite alien to traditional Zen, which deals mainly in parables) and practically every word he writes rings with utter truth and fidelity to the workings of consciousness. He is clearly a man who has absorbed the Zen teachings and then examined the workings of his own mind with unfailing rigor and perceptiveness; he has taken those findings and translated them into language with a care and accuracy that nobody else, to my knowledge, has ever matched. The results are utterly profound. I urge you to take a look at this book for yourself. It is a unique and amazing work which gives solid practical meaning to Zen philosophy, and to the mysteries of the mind.\n\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nForeword by Aldous Huxley\nAuthor's Preface\nChapter 1: On the General Sense of Zen Thought \nChapter 2: 'Good' and 'Evil' \nChapter 3: The Idolatry of 'Salvation' \nChapter 4: The Existentialism of Zen \nChapter 5: The Mechanism of Anxiety \nChapter 6: The Five Modes of Thought of the Natural Man--Psychological Conditions of Satori \nChapter 7: Liberty as 'Total Determinism' \nChapter 8: The Egotistical States\nChapter 9: The Zen Unconscious \nChapter 10: Metaphysical Distress \nChapter 11: Seeing Into One's Own Nature--The Spectator of the Spectacle \nChapter 12: How to Conceive the Inner Task According to Zen\nChapter 13: Obedience to the Nature of Things\nChapter 14: Emotion and the Emotive State\nChapter 15: Sensation and Sentiment\nChapter 16: On Affectivity \nChapter 17: The Horseman and the Horse \nChapter 18: The Primordial Error or 'Original Sin' \nChapter 19: The Immediate Presence of Satori \nChapter 20: Passivity of the Mind and Disintegration of Our Energy \nChapter 21: On the Idea of 'Discipline' \nChapter 22: The Compensations \nChapter 23: The Inner Alchemy \nChapter 24: On Humility\nEpilogue\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4e1db3cd515e2e41d2a01f84ab61464a7960dc3","amp;dn":"Zen+and+the+Psychology+of+Transformation%3A+The+Supreme+Doctrine+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4e1db3cd515e2e41d2a01f84ab61464a7960dc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,225,219,60,213,21,226,228,29,42,1,248,74,182,20,100,167,150,13,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
