The United States of America is at the brink of total collapse. Once a great and powerful nation, the United States is now in a free fall to disaster from which she will never recover. A few more steps in its decline and it will be ruined. These are not easy words for anyone to read, but, nevertheless, they are absolutely true. Tragically, it need not have come to this. As one looks at the history of nations, from Babylon to Rome to America, it is evident that a Divine hand was protecting and guiding America. This country began as a few colonies on the Eastern seaboard of this vast land and became a great nation. But throughout its history a most secretive enemy has been stalking America for over 200 years. She is about to apply the death grip from which America will never recover. This amazing book tells who the enemy is, who they have used in history, who is aiding them today, and how the final scenes will unfold. 105 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b041de511df2e20e4082eaff807dd41df6ba39a","amp;dn":"Hughes-Enemy+Unmasked%28Jesuit+takeover+of+America%29%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b041de511df2e20e4082eaff807dd41df6ba39a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,4,29,229,17,223,46,32,228,8,46,175,248,7,221,65,223,107,163,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
