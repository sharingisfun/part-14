I shall be active as often as possible but NOT 24/7.\n\nap20110103 THE BETTER HALF, Noel Coward\nap20110104 43 LETTERS, Rony Robinson\nap20110105 BURNED TO NOTHING, Rex Obano\nap20110106 A KING\\\\\\'S SPEECH, Mark Burges\nap20110107 THE GREAT HARGEISA GOAT BUBBLE, Julian Gough\nap20110110 BELIEVE ME, Stephanie Dale\nap20110111 I BEFORE BEE, Chris Wilson\nap20110111 INCREDIBLY GUILTY COMIC MORAL, Marcy Kahan\nap20110112 MY HAUNTED EXPRESSION\nap20110113 ESCAPE FROM GAZA, Justin Butcher\nap20110117 THE NEED FOR NONSENSE, Julia Blackburn\nap20110118 MY NAME IS IQBAL MASIH, Bettina Gracias\nap20110119 HAUNTED, Sally Griffiths\nap20110120 NOTES TO SELF, Deborah Wain\nap20110121 PRENUP, Peter Jukes\nap20110124 MARKET - LOCO PARENTIS, Gary Brown\nap20110125 MIRACLE WORKER, Katharine Way\nap20110126 MY YEAR OFF, Robert McCrum\nap20110127 URSULA AND BOY, Abigail Docherty\nap20110128 RED ENTERS THE EYE, Jane Rogers\nap20110131 MARKET - PHONEBREAKER, Steve Sunderland\nap20110606 HEARING VOICES, Jimmy McAleavey\nfp20110108 BAD MEMORIES, Julian Simpson\nfp20110114 OB\\\\\\'OWA, Moya O\\\\\\'Shea\nfp20110122 THE WILD ASS\\\\\\'S SKIN RELOADED, Adrian Penketh\nsp20110101 THE LADY IN THE VAN, Alan Bennett\nsp20110108 TO CATCH A THIEF, David Dodge\nsp20110115 MASTER HAROLD AND THE BOYS, Athol Fugard\nsp20110122 PAYBACK, Jonathan Myerson\nsp20110129  My Dear Children of the Whole World \n\nDonleavy :-)\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6ae3964e68812c2090cfe662bba1ea984248b9","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+Plays+2011-01%28Jan%29+Donleavy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6ae3964e68812c2090cfe662bba1ea984248b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,106,227,150,78,104,129,44,32,144,207,230,98,187,161,234,152,66,72,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
