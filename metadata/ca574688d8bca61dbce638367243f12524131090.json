ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s combination of different urban phat movements that will just give you an extra dose of chords and movements. This project is for those of you who say to me: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jamal, can you just send me some phat chords to practice.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I know exactly what you mean. Sometime I just want some phat chords to add to my playing. Because many of you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have other musicians to shed with, this Phatness Gumbo is just what you need to get you out of the slump of playing the same olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ chords youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been playing.\n\nThese movements are a part of my personal secret stash of chords. These are the chords that give me my sound and character. But remember: The actual movement is not the important part. What I teach you on this DVD is the how, what, where, when, and why! These movements are only templates so that I can take my time teaching you the secrets of the chords, and why it sounds the way it does. More importantly, I tech you how to form your own chords with feel and Ã¢â‚¬Å“flava.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca574688d8bca61dbce638367243f12524131090","amp;dn":"Urban+Phatness+Gumbo+Piano+Lesson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca574688d8bca61dbce638367243f12524131090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,87,70,136,216,188,166,29,188,230,56,54,114,67,241,37,36,19,16,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
