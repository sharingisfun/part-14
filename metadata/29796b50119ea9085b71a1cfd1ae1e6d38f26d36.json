Here the race heads into the Alps on a day designed for a breakaway but the final climb of the Col de Manse is hard and the descent is even harder. Famous for Joseba BelokiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hip smash and Lance ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cyclo-cross, more recently we saw Andy Schleck dropped on the wet descent in 2011 and incidents like this will inspire some into risk-taking and others into caution.\n\n(profile pic and description from inrng.com/tour/#Stage16)\n\nSD broadcast, encapsulated 16:9, 576i, 25fps at ~2500kbps transcoded by ffmpeg/x264 to 576p with settings -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset veryfast -vf &quot;yadif=0:-1:0&quot; -c:a libfdk_aac -ab 64000 -ac 2.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29796b50119ea9085b71a1cfd1ae1e6d38f26d36","amp;dn":"Tour+de+France+2013+stage+16+-+Vaison-La-Romaine+to+Gap","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29796b50119ea9085b71a1cfd1ae1e6d38f26d36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,121,107,80,17,158,169,8,91,113,161,207,209,174,30,109,56,242,109,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
