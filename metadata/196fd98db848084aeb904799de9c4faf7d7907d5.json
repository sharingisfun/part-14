According to Riefenstahl, she had refused to make any more propaganda pictures--&quot;for good reasons,&quot; she explained enigmatically--choosing instead to direct a period romance, based on an old Spanish play and opera by Eugen d'Albert. Riefenstahl cast herself as the central character, Marta, a Spanish dancer who becomes the romantic bone of contention between humble shepherd Franz Eichberger and imperious marquis Bernhard Minetti. While the material seems to cry out for music, Riefenstahl plays the story straight, though much of the acting can certainly be described as operatic. In one scene, the director utilized a band of gypsies as atmosphere extras; as soon as their scenes were completed, the gypsies were returned to their Nazi concentration camp--where most of them were doomed to extermination. Personally financed by Riefenstahl, Tiefland  was filmed between 1942 and 1944, which explains the presence of Maria Koppenhofer (who died in 1948). Final editing was not completed until around 1953, at which time Riefenstahl personally accompanied her print of the film to selected showings in Germany and Austria. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046431/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046431/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-46431/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-46431/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nLeni Riefenstahl\n\n\n\n\n\tBernhard Minetti ... \tDon Sebastian, MarquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨s von Roccabruna\n\n\tLeni Riefenstahl... \tMartha, eine spanische BetteltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nzerin\n\tAribert WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤scher\t... \tCamillo, Verwalter des Don Sebastian\n\tKarl Skraup\t... \tBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rgermeister\n\n\nVideo\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 1 321 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 30.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.143\n      Stream size : 890 MiB (90%)\n      Writing library : DivX 6.8.5\n   Audio\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 86.2 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 33 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.98.2\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:196fd98db848084aeb904799de9c4faf7d7907d5","amp;dn":"Tiefland+%281954%29+Leni+Riefenstahl+Ger%2CEng+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"196fd98db848084aeb904799de9c4faf7d7907d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,111,217,141,184,72,8,74,235,144,71,153,222,156,79,175,125,121,7,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
