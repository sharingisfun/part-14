This unique text/reference includes chapters from some of the top international empirical software engineering researchers and focuses on the practical knowledge necessary for conducting, reporting and using empirical methods in software engineering.\n\nPart 1, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Research Methods and TechniquesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, examines the proper use of various strategies for collecting and analysing data, and the uses for which those strategies are most appropriate. Part 2, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Practical FoundationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, provides a discussion of several important global issues that need to be considered from the very beginning of research planning. Finally, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Knowledge CreationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ offers insight on using a set of disparate studies to provide useful decision support.\n\nTopics and features:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Offers information across a range of techniques, methods, and qualitative and quantitative issues, providing a toolkit for the reader that is applicable across the diversity of software development contexts\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Presents reference material with concrete software engineering examples\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Provides guidance on how to design, conduct, analyse, interpret and report empirical studies, taking into account the common difficulties and challenges encountered in the field\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Arms researchers with the information necessary to avoid fundamental risks\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tackles appropriate techniques for addressing disparate studies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ensuring the relevance of empirical software engineering, and showing its practical impact\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Describes methods that are less often used in the field, providing less conventional but still rigorous and useful ways of collecting data\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supplies detailed information on topics (such as surveys) that often contain methodological errors\n\nThis broad-ranging, practical guide will prove an invaluable and useful reference for practising software engineers and researchers. In addition, it will be suitable for graduate students studying empirical methods in software development.\n\nDr. Forrest Shull is a senior scientist at the Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering, Maryland, and the director of its Measurement and Knowledge Management Division. In addition, he serves as associate editor in chief of IEEE Software magazine, specializing in empirical studies.\n\nDr. Janice Singer heads the Human Computer Interaction program at the National Research Council, Canada. She has been conducting empirical research in software engineering for the past 12 years.\n\nDr. Dag SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸berg is currently research director of the software engineering group of the Simula Research Laboratory, Norway, which is ranked No. 3 in the world (out of 1400 institutions) in an evaluation in 2007 in the area of software and systems engineering.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 400 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; Softcover reprint of hardcover 1st ed. 2008 edition (November 5, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1849967121\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1849967129","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4325728f306490666585216897430149a53e8771","amp;dn":"Guide+to+Advanced+Empirical+Software+Engineering+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4325728f306490666585216897430149a53e8771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,37,114,143,48,100,144,102,101,133,33,104,151,67,1,73,165,62,135,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
