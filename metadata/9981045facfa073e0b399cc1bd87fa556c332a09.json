ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unheard of in Ancient Gaul. So, when the mothers in AsterixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s town want to replace Cacofonix with Bravura, the men are horrified. But, Bravura hits the right notes musically, and she proves very valuable when Julius Caesar sends in his secret weapon: a group of female legionnaries. Caesar thinks the Gauls will be too noble to fight the women...but Bravura has no such scruples! And, even Cacofonix succeeds in coming into his own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9981045facfa073e0b399cc1bd87fa556c332a09","amp;dn":"Asterix+and+the+Secret+Weapon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9981045facfa073e0b399cc1bd87fa556c332a09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,129,4,95,172,250,7,62,11,57,156,193,189,135,250,85,108,51,42,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
