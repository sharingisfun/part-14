Manahan, bestselling author of many environmental texts, presents the material in a practical format that ties together real-world examples from environmental chemistry, green chemistry, and related areas while maintaining brevity and simplicity. The author presents:\n\nAn introduction to chemistry at the most fundamental level\n\n\n\n\nA discussion of environmental chemistry and the now-critical area of sustainable chemical science\n\n\n\n\nA straightforward presentation of the essentials of chemical science\n\n\n\nThe book begins with an introduction to the basic concepts and terms needed to really understand chemistry. With these terms defined in very fundamental ways, it is then possible to cover chemical concepts in greater detail without having to guess what readers know and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know about chemistry. The book also includes basic coverage of organic chemistry and biochemistry. Although other books at the beginner level often omit these topics, those who deal with the real world of environmental pollution, hazardous wastes, agricultural science, and other applied areas quickly realize that a rudimentary understanding of them is essential. These two features make the book not only unique but also practical.\n\n\n\nSupplying the nuts and bolts of the science, Manahan elucidates the basics of chemistry in a clear, concise format with tie-ins to environmental chemistry and green chemistry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42131d158d359359b1fb79f1ae683ecb3feefceb","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Sustainable+Chemical+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42131d158d359359b1fb79f1ae683ecb3feefceb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,19,29,21,141,53,147,89,177,251,121,241,174,104,62,203,63,238,252,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
