Intended for William Primrose who commissioned it, Bartok died and left the work on unnumbered pages with plenty of annotations and suggestions for scoring. The composer's friend,\r\nTibor Serly, took on the task of bringing it all together, along with suggestions from Primrose. More recently, two other editions have joined Serly's, but this is the one that was played for years--with the original performer/dedicatee, Primrose, under Klemperer's intense, energetic baton.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBios, essay and full text in Italian with translations are enclosed.
