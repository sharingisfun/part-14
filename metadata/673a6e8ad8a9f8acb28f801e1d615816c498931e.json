The music itself stays the same.  The information I am offering doesn't.  Please let me explain...\n\nI believe it was lategrad who, back in 2013, asked me to begin breaking down the genres found within these bundles.  It was a good idea.  And anyone who reads these messages with regularity knows that I have been doing just that.  Although I probably mess up on identifying the styles more often than I ever get it right, I was still happy to give it a shot.\n\nThat being said, I ran across some mangled road kill a few days ago that was once my &quot;The Year In Christian Music&quot; bundles.  An individual, I believe perhaps in Romania, was picking apart these bundles, and then sharing the remnants on a private tracker, minus half of the content.  He didn't include any rap, rock, alternative, etc because he felt, and I quote, it was &quot;demonic&quot; music.\n\nNow ordinarily I could care less.  I just want God's message delivered.  Period.  But when the body of my ministry is picked apart and then shared elsewhere, under the exact same name I am sharing it here, then it does nothing more than pollute the trading pool.  In other words, I would have had no issue with the guy if he shared his broken down (and less demonic) offerings under a different name other than &quot;The Year In Christian Music.&quot;\n\nSo I'm running a little experiment today.  Please bare with me.  I believe he will be back to grab this torrent.  And, as he's done all year long, he will share it on that other tracker.  But if I don't make it easy for him to just dine specifically on the chef's five-star recommendations, but rather force his hand to sample the entire buffet, how will he know what to share on that other tracker?\n\nAnd of course, for anyone who has come to rely on the genre breakdown, please know that I'll continue to do it in the future.  But for now, and perhaps over the next few bundles, I just don't want to make it overly easy for him by flagging only certain genres which he will no doubt continue to share under this same bundle names.\n\nThere are 28 titles being offered today, including...\n\n * Andy James - 2014 - I Tried - Single\n * Bethel Music - 2014 - You Make Me Brave\n * Bread Of Stone - 2014 - The Real Life - Deluxe Edition\n * Cindy Cruse Ratcliff - 2014 - Heaven Raining Down\n * Da T.R.U.T.H - 2014 - Heartbeat\n * Delight - 2014 - Delight In You - Single\n * Disciple, The - 2014 - Discipleship 101\n * Erica Campbell - 2014 - Help\n * Francesca Battistelli - 2014 - If We're Honest\n * Grace - 2014 - Drifting - Single\n * Grace Church Music - 2014 - The Finished Work Of Christ - Single\n * How The West Was Won - 2014 - Wild And Waste EP\n * Jonathan Noel - 2014 - The Stone EP\n * LW Worship - 2014 - Nothing In This World\n * New Hope Oahu YPAC - 2014 - Glorious Cross\n * One Republic - 2014 - Native - Re-Issue\n * Page CXVI - 2014 - Good Friday To Easter\n * Paul Wilbur - 2014 - Ultimate Collection\n * Plus One - 2014 - My All - Single\n * Regardless Of Consequence - 2014 - The Anxiety EP\n * RichRhymes - 2014 - My Greatest Hits\n * Shawn McDonald - 2014 - Brave\n * Sixteen Cities - 2014 - Once For All - Single\n * Spillover Music - 2014 - Holy Week Audio Resource\n * Stellar Kart - 2014 - Frozen EP\n * Team Lyric - 2014 - The Journey\n * ThaKidd Jopp - 2014 - Barz And Worship\n * Various - 2014 - All About Worship Collective, Vol 9\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts, April 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:673a6e8ad8a9f8acb28f801e1d615816c498931e","amp;dn":"2014+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+18%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"673a6e8ad8a9f8acb28f801e1d615816c498931e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,58,110,138,216,169,248,172,178,143,128,30,29,97,88,22,196,152,147,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
