He is also an adventurer, whose exploits are recorded in Marvels: A Magazine Of Men's Adventure. He is initially accompanied by his associate James Rhodes, his personal assistant Giulietta Nefaria and his biographer Vergil Munsey. When Nefaria is revealed as working with the Nazis (specifically Baron Zemo and Baron von Strucker) and Vergil is killed, their role in the story is taken by Stark's new biographer Pepper Potts. His heart having been damaged on an earlier adventure, Stark keeps it going with repulsor technology installed and recharged by Stark Industries engineer Edwin Jarvis.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/news/review-iron-man-noir/140909/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/news/review-iron-man-noir/140909/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587c612057bb82dcc9acbdb56eaa91cc3dd22b53","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+Noir+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587c612057bb82dcc9acbdb56eaa91cc3dd22b53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,124,97,32,87,187,130,220,201,172,189,181,110,170,145,204,61,210,43,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
