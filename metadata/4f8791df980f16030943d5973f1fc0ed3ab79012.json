It uses great acting and loads of exciting special effects and sci-fi aliens that totally rock. The show started originally back in 1963, when William Hartnell stepped in as a pequiliar fellow named the doctor, who lived with his neice in a police box. His niece's teachers wanted to meet him, so they broke in to the police box, only to find out that this box was a time machine, and they were suddenly whisked away on a series of strange but wonderful adventures to numerous other worlds.[/b]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nm6EriX.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f8791df980f16030943d5973f1fc0ed3ab79012","amp;dn":"Doctor_Who_2005.8x11.Dark_Water.HDTV_x264-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f8791df980f16030943d5973f1fc0ed3ab79012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,135,145,223,152,15,22,3,9,67,213,151,63,31,192,237,58,183,144,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
