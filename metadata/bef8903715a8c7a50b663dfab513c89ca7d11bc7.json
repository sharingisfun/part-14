As an artistic and energetic glitter-loving diva in the making, the 11-year-oldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vivid daydreams about how life should be are often played out as full-blown musical productions. In her mind, Hudson Rivers (David Mazouz), the eighth cutest boy in Mackerel Middle School, returns her affections and Angeline (Sterling Griffith), the prettiest and most popular girl in school, and other perfect people like her, are banished so that average folk get their due. Real life, however, is somewhat different and, as a result, Jamie pours out her innermost thoughts in her cherished diary and shares some of her feelings with her beloved Aunt Carol (Laura Bell Bundy) as well as her shrewd best friend Isabella (Mary-Charles Jones), who may not be the best influence on her.\n\n When Mackerel Middle SchoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arts program is threatened because of budget cuts, Assistant Principal Devon (James Waterston) announces the districtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first-ever Jump-a-thon fundraiser. Jamie sees her winning participation as an opportunity to not only save the arts program, but to impress Hudson, and by beating Angeline, bring justice to ordinary people of the world. At the same time, she becomes the unwitting participant in one of IsabellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s schemes and her diary goes missing. As the story progresses, Jamie recognizes the importance of doing the right thing, learns not to judge by appearances and puts aside personal feelings for the greater good. She also discovers her own sparkling inner beauty, which was there all along. Does Jamie's beloved diary land in the wrong hands, or is she able to get her prized possession back unscathed?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCast / Bios \tEmily Alyn Lind\nJamie\n\n\tDavid Mazouz \nHudson Rivers\n\n\tMary-Charles Jones\nIsabella\n\n\tSterling Griffith\nAngeline\n\n\tLaura Bell Bundy\nAunt Carol\n\n\tLea DeLaria\nMiss Bruntford\n\n\tMaddie Corman\nMom\n\n\tJames Waterston\nAssistant Principal Devon\n\n\n  \t\t \nEmily Alyn Lind / Jamie \n\nEmily Alyn LindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body of work would be impressive for any Hollywood actress, but for a rising star of only 11 years old, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite remarkable. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not surprising though, given her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s background in the entertainment industry. Lind is the middle daughter of producer and assistant director John Lind and actress Barbara Alyn Woods, best known for her roles as Diane in DisneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Honey I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and as Deb Scott in the long-running CW series Ã¢â‚¬Å“One Tree Hill.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ LindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 12-year-old sister, Natalie, has been seen on Ã¢â‚¬Å“iCarlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wizards of Waverly PlaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and her 5-year-old sister, Alyvia, plays both Faith on CBSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Young and the RestlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a younger version of Lind on ABCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Revenge.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\n Lind soon became a popular face on television with a recurring role on the ABC series Ã¢â‚¬Å“EastwickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and on the daytime drama Ã¢â‚¬Å“All My Children.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Her roles continued on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Medium,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Criminal Minds,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hallmark Hall of FameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“November ChristmasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and LifetimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who Is Clark Rockefeller?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“SundayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at TiffanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She most recently completed working on the NBC sci-fi pilot Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beautiful PeopleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the untitled Dorf/Falcone pilot for CBS. Lind is regularly seen as Amanda Clark on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Revenge.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\n In 2011, Lind was given the amazing opportunity to play Shirley Temple in Clint EastwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“J. Edgar,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ opposite Leonardo di Caprio. And in 2012, she had two films premiere: The thriller Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Haunting in Georgia,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ playing the lead role of Heidi and the highly anticipated Ã¢â‚¬Å“WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Back Down,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ playing Malia Fitzpatrick, a young girl struggling with dyslexia, starring opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal. Lind just completed work on the Warner Bros. suspense thriller Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hidden,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ starring alongside Alexander Skarsgard. \n\n Lind lives with her family and their puppy, Georgie, in the greater Los Angeles area and is a stellar student, despite the heavy demands of her filming schedule. The compassion and sensitivity that she brings to her on-screen characters is also reflected in her dedicated work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bef8903715a8c7a50b663dfab513c89ca7d11bc7","amp;dn":"Dear+Dumb+Diary_HDTV.x264_TTL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bef8903715a8c7a50b663dfab513c89ca7d11bc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,248,144,55,21,168,199,165,11,102,61,250,181,19,200,156,167,209,27,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
