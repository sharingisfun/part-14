A New Yorker staff writer since 1996, he visits obscure laboratories and infomercial set kitchens as often as the hangouts of freelance cool-hunters -- a sort of pop-R&amp;D gumshoe -- and for that has become a star lecturer and bestselling author.\n\nSparkling with curiosity, undaunted by difficult research (yet an eloquent, accessible writer), his work uncovers truths hidden in strange data. His always-delightful blog tackles topics from serial killers to steroids in sports, while provocative recent work in the New Yorker sheds new light on the Flynn effect -- the decades-spanning rise in I.Q. scores.\n\nGladwell has written two books. The Tipping Point, which began as a New Yorker piece, applies the principles of epidemiology to crime (and sneaker sales), while Blink examines the unconscious processes that allow the mind to &quot;thin slice&quot; reality -- and make decisions in the blink of an eye. A third book is forthcoming.\n\n    &quot;Pure Gladwell: cutting through conventional wisdom to define a new way of understanding how something works.&quot;\n\nWashingtonian\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
