Margaret is the reincarnation of the ancient Egyptian priestess Queen Tera. The daughter of a famous Egyptologist, Professor Fuchs, Margaret dreams nightly about an Egyptian queen whose hand is severed by her high priests in hopes of limiting her supernatural powers. But Tera's evil won't be stopped. In fact, Tera entered Margaret's body on the day of her birth, 20 years ago, the very day Dr. Fuchs entered Tera's tomb. When Dr. Fuchs gives his daughter Tera's ruby ring on her 20th birthday, Tera's yen for power comes alive in Margaret.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x384, 23.976 fps, 1825 Kbps, 01h33m30s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles:\r\nCzech, Dutch, English, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese-Brazil, Serbian, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/9i7i01br5/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/vxz9r480t/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ji2jxdeot/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ofbj4qra5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/a7lug3el9/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9026ff8a1073548fcec1fbe23373338896fdd41","amp;dn":"Blood+from+the+Mummy%27s+Tomb+%5B1971+-+UK%5D+Hammer+horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9026ff8a1073548fcec1fbe23373338896fdd41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,2,111,248,161,7,53,72,252,236,31,190,35,55,51,56,137,111,221,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
