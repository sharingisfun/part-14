Like Peter Wright's Spycatcher (Penguin USA, 1987), which was suppressed in Britain , this book on Israel's legendary spy organization by a former Mossad katsa or case officer has ended up on the New York Times best seller list. Among the controversial revelations that led Israel to seek a ban (which was quickly overturned in the United States and Canada) is Ostrovsky's charge that the Mossad refused to share knowledge of a planned suicide mission in Beirut, resulting in the deaths of 241 U.S. Marines in 1983. Another New York Times best seller, Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman's Every Spy a Prince ( LJ 7/90), provides more reliable details on Israel's spy network.\n- Wilda Wil liams, &quot;Library Journal&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b988cfe8f62e6eaccfc31738dc687c4738257d9e","amp;dn":"By+Way+of+Deception.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b988cfe8f62e6eaccfc31738dc687c4738257d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,136,207,232,246,46,110,172,207,195,23,56,220,104,124,71,56,37,125,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
