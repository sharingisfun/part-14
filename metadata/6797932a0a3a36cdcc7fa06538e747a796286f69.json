MankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopes for world peace lie battered and broken. Take command of SternÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wildcats, an elite squadron of mercs trying to fly straight in a world of deceit and violence. Engage rival merc squadrons, third world dictators, and the armies of the dreaded IRS. In a world gone mad, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of room to fly, all thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s required is the cash.\n\nStrike Commander puts you in the best place to witness fast-paced dogfighting action: the pilotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seat. Fly high as you take on over 60 missions, each more challenging than the last in your top-of the-line F16 squadron piloted by the best crew in the business (operational success rate of 86%). Strike Commander is a classic flight combat sim where a pilot is only as good as his, or her, last flight. Fly to survive and survive to fly, in this modern-day action-oriented jet fighter combat simulation!\n\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: EVERYONE with Animated Violence.\n\nMinimum system requirements: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8, 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9, 2GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard.\nACCEPTANCE OF END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT REQUIRED TO PLAY\n\nInstall and Play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6797932a0a3a36cdcc7fa06538e747a796286f69","amp;dn":"Strike+Commander+GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6797932a0a3a36cdcc7fa06538e747a796286f69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,151,147,42,10,58,54,205,204,127,160,101,56,231,71,167,150,40,111,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
