Whether it's female heroes in history, secret note-passing skills, science projects, friendship bracelets, double dutch, cats cradle, the perfect cartwheel or the eternal mystery of what boys are thinking, this book has it all. But it's not just a guide to giggling at sleepoversÃ¢â‚¬â€although that's included, of course! Whether readers consider themselves tomboys, girly-girls, or a little bit of both, this book is every girl's invitation to adventure.\n\n**\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nKadushin, whose lush voice brought the heroine of Stephenie Meyers's Twilight series to life, does her best to inject some intrigue and mystery into this mile-wide, inch-deep compendium of random facts billed as a manual for everything that girls need to know, a selection from the bestselling book. Alas, the audio version, replete with time lines, 14 variations of how to play tag and sesquipedalian vocabulary words, sorely lacks dynamism. The brief histories of famous womenÃ¢â‚¬â€Joan of Arc, Marie Curie, SalomeÃ¢â‚¬â€make for more engaging listening than material about how to change a tire or administer first aid. Listeners might find themselves wishing for something akin to the screen selection feature on a DVD, so that if they need information on, say, what constitutes a foul in tetherball, they could get to it without having to wade through the section on women who have earned patents for various inventions. Without such an index, the listener is reduced to writing down the information Kadushin relays, which raises the question: isn't this available in book form? \n\nReview\n\nPraise for The Daring Book for Girls 'Gung-ho girly advice!the boys had their Dangerous book, now this one is for us' Good Housekeeping 'I can't imagine not wanting to get stuck in to The Daring Book for Girls. It's an admirable project' Jenny Diski, Sunday Times 'The authors mix inspiring tales of girls who made good ... with a scrap bag of how-tos for girlish activities ... The Daring Book for Girls keeps ... practical knowledge from getting drowned in the techno-flow' The New York Times 'We've had The Dangerous Book for Boys - now it's our turn.
