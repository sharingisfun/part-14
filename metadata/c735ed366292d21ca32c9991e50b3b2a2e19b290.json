She is the eldest daughter of country music icon Johnny Cash and his first wife, Vivian Liberto Cash Distin. \n\n- - -\n\nNot particularly country-sounding, the introspective Interiors was seen by a number of critics and fans as a personal catharsis for Rosanne Cash. Shortly after its release, she broke up with husband and longtime producer Rodney Crowell. In a first, Cash produced the album herself, and all of the songs are either written or co-written by Cash. However, the album did not do very well commercially, reaching only no.23 on the Billboard charts. (wikipedia)\n\n- - -\n\nRosanne Cash - Interiors 1990\n(CBS)\n\n 1. On The Inside  \n 2.
