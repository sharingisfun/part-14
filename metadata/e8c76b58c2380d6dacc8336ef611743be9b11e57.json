The album was recorded at The Manor Studio in Oxfordshire, Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey, Air Studios in Montserrat and at McClear Place in Toronto. Hold Your Fire was the last Rush studio album released outside Canada by PolyGram/Mercury.\n\nRush continued to explore new songwriting territory in Hold Your Fire. &quot;Tai Shan&quot;, for example, is influenced by classical Chinese music, and its title is a reference to Mount Tai in China's Shandong province, which lyricist Neil Peart discovered during his bicycle trip in China.'Til Tuesday bassist and vocalist Aimee Mann contributed vocals to &quot;Open Secrets&quot; and &quot;Time Stand Still&quot;, appearing in the Zbigniew RybczyÃ…â€žski-directed video for the latter. In addition, Mann's laugh is heard at the beginning of &quot;Force Ten&quot;, and a backward sample of her vocals from another track is also used at the end of &quot;Tai Shan&quot;.\n\nThe album was not as commercially successful as much of the band's releases of the 1980s, only peaking at #13 on the Billboard charts, the lowest debut for a Rush album since Hemispheres.However, the album did eventually go gold.\n\nHold Your Fire marked the first time that Geddy Lee used the Roland D-50 keyboard.\n\nTrack Listing [Remastered] [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Force Ten&quot;   \t4:31\n02. \t&quot;Time Stand Still&quot;   \t5:09\n03. \t&quot;Open Secrets&quot;   \t5:38\n04. \t&quot;Second Nature&quot;   \t4:36\n05. \t&quot;Prime Mover&quot;   \t5:19\n06. \t&quot;Lock and Key&quot;   \t5:09\n07. \t&quot;Mission&quot;   \t5:16\n08. \t&quot;Turn the Page&quot;   \t4:55\n09. \t&quot;Tai Shan&quot;   \t4:15\n10. \t&quot;High Water&quot;   \t5:33","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8c76b58c2380d6dacc8336ef611743be9b11e57","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Hold+Your+Fire+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8c76b58c2380d6dacc8336ef611743be9b11e57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,199,107,88,194,56,13,109,172,200,51,110,246,17,116,59,233,177,30,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
