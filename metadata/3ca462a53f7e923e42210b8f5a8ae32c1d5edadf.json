Source: killyourstereo.com\n \nArtist.Broadcast\nAlbum.Guidelines\nLabel.Snapping Fingers Snapping Necks\nYear.2013\nGenre.Post-hardcore / Punk\nFor Fans Of.Underoath - Senses Fail\nSummary.Straightforward and real.\n \nREVIEW.\n\nBroadcastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intent to create a straightforward and not heavily produced release with Ã¢â‚¬ËœGuidelinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is apparent from the very beginning with Ã¢â‚¬ËœDeviantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. It is perhaps an odd choice of beginning for the Swedish band, as the entire song serves as a build to the final epic chant, but it certainly works. \n\nUnlike many bands dabbling in the post-hardcore genre, Broadcast are not at all out for extravagant displays of technical proficiency. They instead choose to write songs simply based on what sounds good regardless of whether or not a high dexterity may be required. Ã¢â‚¬ËœHopeless EndeavourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shows this, while also continuing what Ã¢â‚¬ËœDeviantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ started. The track is guided by a simple lead guitar for the most part, which, in combat with some great clean vocals and a notable drum moment just following the beginning, makes for a pretty decent track.\n\nThe title track is filled with repetitive high-guitar riffs that stand above a more cumbersome low fuzz, while the slow screaming vocals blend into the mix. It is not at all a standout track, but something about the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach says that it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t meant to be.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœHistory, For What It IsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ deviates a little bit, moving in more of a conventional punk direction at the beginning, with fast-paced double time drums, and almost unintelligible bellowing vocals. Soon enough though, things become a little more standard and the general feel of the band returns.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœGuidelinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is honest. It's rough around the edges to a certain degree, but shows the band puts both energy and effort into their music. Can't argue with that.\nCONCLUSION.\n\nBroadcast are not at all 'run-of-the-mill', and this is what sets them apart in a scene where often bands can just blend together. This release shows an sincere band who are not out to prove anything. They just want to write engaging music.\n\n\n \t\t00 Broadcast album art 01.JPG\t                        39.05 KB\n \t\t01 Deviants.flac 44.1kHz 1026kbps\t                32.67 MB\n \t\t02 Hopeless Endeavour.flac 44.1kHz 1018kbps\t        19.30 MB\n \t\t03 Guidelines.flac 44.1kHz 1019kbps\t                22.33 MB\n \t\t04 History, For What It Is.flac 44.1kHz 1047kbps\t27.49 MB\n \t\t05 Came Here To Live.flac 44.1kHz 874kbps\t        23.85 MB\n \t\tBroadcast - Guidelines.m3u\t                          341 bytes\n \t\tGuidelines.cue\t                                          664 bytes\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t                  1.2 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker.log\t                                  462 bytes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ca462a53f7e923e42210b8f5a8ae32c1d5edadf","amp;dn":"Broadcast+-+Guidelines+EP+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ca462a53f7e923e42210b8f5a8ae32c1d5edadf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,164,98,165,63,126,146,62,66,33,11,143,90,138,227,44,29,94,218,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
