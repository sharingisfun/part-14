Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C.The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.\n\nLike other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.\n\nCPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.\nNon-Programmer's_Tutorial_for_Python_2.6 { UPPOG2 } torrents\n\n[b]Paradigm(s) Multi-paradigm: object-oriented, imperative, functional, procedural, reflective[/b]\nAppeared in 1991; 22 years ago\nDesigned by Guido van Rossum\nDeveloper Python Software Foundation\nStable release 3.3.2 /\n15 May 2013\n2.7.5 /\n15 May 2013\nTyping discipline duck, dynamic, strong\nMajor implementations CPython, PyPy, IronPython, Jython\nDialects Cython, RPython, Stackless Python\nInfluenced by ABC,[1] ALGOL 68,[2] C,[3] C++,[4] Dylan,[5] Haskell,[6] Icon,[7] Java,[8] Lisp,[9] Modula-3,[4] Perl\nInfluenced Boo, Cobra, D, Falcon, Go, Groovy, JavaScript, F#, Nimrod, Ruby[10]\nOS Cross-platform\nLicense Python Software Foundation License\nUsual filename extensions .py, .pyw, .pyc, .pyo, .pyd \n[b]\nBook Details :\n\nSize : 1.3 Mb\nTitle : Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6\nPages : 128\nFormat : pdf[/b]\n\nLike us on facebook...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www./torrentsharing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www./torrentsharing&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce870c47df0d1803121642232353cd9ee94ce7ad","amp;dn":"Non-Programmer%27s+Tutorial+for+Python+2.6+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce870c47df0d1803121642232353cd9ee94ce7ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,135,12,71,223,13,24,3,18,22,66,35,35,83,205,158,233,76,231,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
