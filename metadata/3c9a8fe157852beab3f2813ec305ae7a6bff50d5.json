I'm absolutely amazed at how far the &quot;five keys&quot; extend. Chapter 3 (key 2) was especially helpful to me in managing unwanted thoughts.\n\nEven though this book is geared towards sexual addiction, the methods presented in it are applicable to a range of other issues. \n\nThis is one of the few books I know of that offers help to both the addict and the family/friends of the addict. The guidelines given are applicable to anyone who wants to help their family member/friend with any kind of issue.\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised to see so much information packed into every page. The book is short. And so it should be. I am sick of sifting through 200-300-page self-help books in which the primary purpose of the author seems to be to hear him/herself talk. I can't tell you how many of those books I didn't finish. &quot;The Language of Recovery&quot; is short, it's to the point and it doesn't mince words. I finished it--and for that reason alone it's worth the price.\n\nFor those among us who are atheists, agnostics, or &quot;unforgiven&quot;: The book takes a faith-based approach, especially Chapter 6. However, I must stress that the scripture quotes are NOT OVERWHELMING. They are applicable, and they illustrate the points very well. (If you know my views, you will recognize this as a very high compliment!) If you fall into one of the categories I mentioned, Chapter 6 (key 5) may not be for you. Or, it may be exactly what you need. The two points I'm trying to make, without giving too much away, are these: \n\n1. What you believe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. \n2. Believe in your success and you will find it that much easier to work towards it. \n\nThere. There's your atheist definition of &quot;faith&quot; with a lower-case &quot;f&quot;. Taking this approach should make Chapter 6 a lot easier to read and to take in.\n\nConclusion: Great book, written by someone who seems to truly want to help instead of to hear himself talk.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shop.innergold.com/The-Langu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shop.innergold.com/The-Langu&lt;/a&gt; ... IGC600.htm\n&quot;Written by Gordon Bruin, from a Christian perspective, Do not take my advice or anyone else's before talking to your doctor/counselor/other professional. Depending on where you live, you may be able to find free, confidential care. Most importantly, sometimes your shrink can be wrong. Get a second opinion.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c9a8fe157852beab3f2813ec305ae7a6bff50d5","amp;dn":"inner+GOLD+-THE+LANGUAGE+OF+RECOVERY-+DR+Gordon+S.+Bruin%2C+M.A.%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c9a8fe157852beab3f2813ec305ae7a6bff50d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,154,143,225,87,133,43,234,179,242,129,62,195,5,174,122,107,255,80,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
