Fudd/Egghead is a fictional cartoon character and one of the most famous\nLooney Tunes characters, and the de facto archenemy of Bugs Bunny. He has one of the\nmore disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself).\nHis aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other\nantagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws,\nso 'Watch the road, Rabbit', is replaced with 'Watch the woad, wabbit!' Elmer's signature\ncatchphrase is, 'Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits', as well as his trademark.\n\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN DONE DOWNLOADING!!!!!\n\n\nMORE TO COME!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41eb9192a2a27a6f2b7ae55dfce83ce60143f182","amp;dn":"Elmer+Fudd+Pack+%281937-1992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41eb9192a2a27a6f2b7ae55dfce83ce60143f182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,235,145,146,162,162,122,111,43,122,229,93,252,232,60,230,1,67,241,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
