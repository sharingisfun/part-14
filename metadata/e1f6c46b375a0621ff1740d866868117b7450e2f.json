His mother, Laura (NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Bonn) worked as a homemaker.\n\nRichard&amp;#039;s parents married in late 1909, or early 1910, and soon started a family which would eventually include three daughters and three sons: Robert, Helen, Lorene, Richard, Florence, and Raymond Proenneke.\n\nThe year of Richard&amp;#039;s birth is often given as 1917, but social security and census records prove him to have been born in Primrose, Harrison Township, Lee County, Iowa, on 4 May 1916.\n\n\n[edit] Early life and pre-retirement years\nLittle can be found about the early life of Mr. Proenneke. It is known that he comes from the town of Primrose, Iowa.\n\nMr. Proenneke served in the United States Navy as a carpenter during World War II. It was during this service that he contracted rheumatic fever and was bedridden for nearly six months. According to Sam Keith, a life-long friend from Duxbury, Massachusetts, this down time was very revealing for Proenneke, who decided to devote the rest of his life to the strength and health of his body.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the Navy, Proenneke went to school to become a diesel mechanic. The combination of his high intelligence, unique adaptability, and strong work ethic turned him into a very skilled mechanic. Though quite adept at his trade, Proenneke succumbed to the call of nature within him and moved to Oregon to work at a sheep ranch.\n\nProenneke eventually decided to attempt a start at his own cattle ranch. With an unnamed friend, he moved to Shuyak Island, Alaska in 1950. Proenneke soon discovered that Alaska is not ranch country and he abandoned this venture.\n\nFor several years Dick worked as a heavy equipment operator and repairman on the naval base at Kodiak. Proenneke spent the next several years working throughout the state of Alaska as both a salmon fisherman and diesel mechanic. He worked for the Fish and Wildlife Service at King Salmon on the Alaska Peninsula. His skills as a mechanic were well-known and extremely sought after, and he was able to put away a modest nest egg for retirement.\n\nAfter some thought on the matter, and a serious accident while working as a diesel mechanic, Proenneke decided he would like to retire in the wilderness of Alaska, specifically at a place called Twin Lakes. In the summer of 1967, Proenneke was dropped off at Twin Lakes for the season so he could fell timber, white spruce logs required for the building of his dream retirement home. He flew out before the lakes froze up for the winter and went home to Iowa to spend time with his family and do his customary good deeds around the small town and prepare supplies and plans for his retirement.\n\n\n[edit] Retirement life at Twin Lakes\nDick Proenneke started his adventure to Alaska by driving his camper north. In a Nebraska town he bought a felt-tipped marker and on the back of his camper printed in big letters, &quot;DESTINATIONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½BACK AND BEYOND.&quot; On May 21, 1968, Proenneke arrived at his new place of retirement at Twin Lakes. Before arriving at the lakes, he made arrangements to use a cabin on the upper lake of Twin Lakes owned by a retired Navy captain, Spike Carrithers, and his wife Hope from Kodiak, (in whose care he had left his camper). This cabin was well situated on the lake and close to the site which Proenneke chose for the construction of his own cabin.\n\nProenneke spent May, June, and July 1968 building his cabin by hand and with nothing but hand tools. The cabin was complete with windows, one of which was designed and built of PET film by Proenneke himself to face the lake and not fog up. He also built furniture including chairs, tables, a desk, and a bunk; a log cache built up on poles to store food and goods that needed to be kept away from wildlife; a stone and mortar fireplace; and many decorations such as a plaster of paris wolf track and moose and caribou antler decorations.\n\nProenneke&amp;#039;s bush pilot friend, Babe Alsworth, returned occasionally to bring food and orders that Proenneke placed through him to Sears. While Proenneke lived largely off the land, he enjoyed things like red beans, bacon, and seasonings, all of which he proclaimed to be life&amp;#039;s real luxuries.\n\nSeveral times during his life at Twin Lakes, Proenneke was bluff charged or in danger from brown bears. He also became quite adept at taming animals, befriending many squirrels (all of which he named &quot;Freddy&quot;), a weasel, many birds, and (almost) a wolverine.\n\nProenneke remained at Twin Lakes for the next 16 months, when he left to go home for a spell to visit relatives and secure more supplies. He returned to the lakes in the following spring and remained there for most of the next 30 years, coming to the lower 48 only occasionally to be with his family, for whom he cared a great deal.\n\nAs is common among Alaskans, Proenneke was always searching for gold; as evidenced by the pan attached to his backpack and cabin in pictures of the same. He did indeed find some goldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½see his second set of journalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½however, he never found the mother lode he was searching for.\n\n\n[edit] Death and legacy\nIn 1999, at age 82, Proenneke decided to come back to civilization for good. The -50 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°F (-46 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C) winters had become too much for his aged body to cope with and he returned to live the remainder of his life with his brother in California.\n\nProenneke was a wonderful journalist and recorded most of his life at Twin Lakes in film, photography, and written record. His earthquake reports helped scientists learn how seismic waves travel through the immense mountain ranges of Alaska. His recording of animal and hunter habits helped scientists realize how hunting affects wild animal populations.[citation needed]\n\nProenneke died of a stroke April 28, 2003. He left his cabin to the parks service and it remains today as a popular visitor attraction in the still-remote Twin Lakes region.\n\nIn 1973, Sam Keith produced the book One Man&amp;#039;s Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey (ISBN 0-88240-513-6), based on Proenneke&amp;#039;s journals and photography.\n\nIn 2005, some of Proenneke&amp;#039;s film, Alone in the Wilderness, began appearing on U.S. Public Television. Primarily, the film consists of shots of Proenneke performing tasks around his cabin, canoeing and walking, and views of wildlife, along with narration. For shots of himself (since he was alone), Proenneke fixed the camera in place, and then performed his tasks. This would necessitate him returning to the camera after walking or canoeing away.\n\nAlso in 2005, the National Park Service and the Alaska Natural History Association published More Readings From One Man&amp;#039;s Wilderness, another volume of Proenneke&amp;#039;s journal entries. The book, edited by longtime Lake Clark National Park employee and friend-of-Proenneke John Branson, covers the years when the Park was established. The journal entries show that Proenneke&amp;#039;s feelings about wilderness and the Park Service were complex and can&amp;#039;t be summed up in phrases like &quot;not a bunny hugger.&quot;\n\nThe actual location on the Upper Twin Lake is at coordinates 60Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°38ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²59ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³N 153Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°48ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²38ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³WÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿ / ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿60.64972, -153.81056Coordinates: 60Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°38ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²59ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³N 153Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°48ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²38ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³WÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿ / ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿60.64972, -153.81056\n\nPLEASE CLICK ON HOMESCHOOL OR MY NAME CEZEN (WWW.THEPIRATEBAY.ORG/USER/CEZEN TO FIND MORE OF MY UPLOADS FOR HOMESCHOOLERS AND EDUCATIONALY MINDED FOLKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f6c46b375a0621ff1740d866868117b7450e2f","amp;dn":"More+Readings+from+One+Mans+Wilderness+Dick+Proenneke+Educationa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1f6c46b375a0621ff1740d866868117b7450e2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,246,196,107,55,90,6,33,255,23,64,216,102,134,129,23,183,69,14,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
