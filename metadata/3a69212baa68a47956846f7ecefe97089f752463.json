Throughout the 1980s, the band accumulated numerous hit songs in Canada and the United States, making four multi-platinum albums, and selling millions of records. After being rejected by many U.S. record labels, they signed with Columbia Records Canada and began recording their first album March 20, 1980 with Mike Reno on lead vocals, Paul Dean as the guitarist, Scott Smith as the bassist, Doug Johnson on keyboards, and Matt Frenette on drums. The band&amp;#039;s hit singles, particularly &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; and &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot; have become arena rock staples, and are still heard on many classic rock radio stations across the United States and Canada. They are currently based in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\n&quot;Working for the Weekend&quot; was a song released in 1981 on the rock band Loverboy&amp;#039;s second album Get Lucky. The song contained more of a pop feel than the other songs that the band produced, but this new sound proved to generate a lot of success, as the song reached #29 on the pop singles charts, and #2 in mainstream rock in the United States in January 1982. The song is considered an Anti-Work Anthem.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a69212baa68a47956846f7ecefe97089f752463","amp;dn":"Loverboy+-+Working+For+The+Weekend","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a69212baa68a47956846f7ecefe97089f752463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,105,33,43,170,104,164,121,86,132,111,126,206,254,151,8,159,117,36,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
