In\ncontrast to her relatively wild previous album &quot;Shape&quot;, or her more adventurous\nalbums with &quot;You Had Me At Hello&quot;, the playing here is quite accessible, but\nwithout being mainstream: without actual soloing, the two saxes are engaged in\na continuous free dialogue of action and reaction, assent and dissent, with\nbass and drums feeling equally comfortable in the open musical environment. The\nmusic is extremely lyrical, very rhythmic, but without patterns or themes.\n\nThe sound quality of the recording is superb, easily illustrated by Peacock's\nbass on &quot;Petit Matin&quot;, which is absolutely stunning in its sensitive subtlety,\nequalled by Grimaldi's soaring soprano.\n\nSome of the more composed pieces have a more post-boppish character, and the\nalbum would have had more unity without them. That notwithstanding, and without\nreally being adventurous, the album is a delight of intimate musical joy and\ninterplay.\n\n--\n\nby Duncan Heining &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/reviews-mainmenu-132/19-cd-reviews/12489-grimal-konitz-peacock-and-motian--owls-talk-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/reviews-mainmenu-132/19-cd-reviews/12489-grimal-konitz-peacock-and-motian--owls-talk-&lt;/a&gt;\n\npar Sophie Chambon (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.citizenjazz.com/Alexandra-Grimal,3467478.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.citizenjazz.com/Alexandra-Grimal,3467478.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor Pachi Tapiz (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/test/?p=2221&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/test/?p=2221&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c0569918ea82e4b2ec780df5b8a0eac49624734","amp;dn":"Alexandra+Grimal%2C+Lee+Konitz%2C+Gary+Peacock%2C+Paul+Motian+-+Owls+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c0569918ea82e4b2ec780df5b8a0eac49624734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,5,105,145,142,168,46,75,46,199,128,223,91,138,14,172,73,98,71,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
