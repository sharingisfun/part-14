T.J. Hooker. Twilight Zone plane guy. Johnny Legal (presumably his name on Boston Legal, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bother to check).The Dad Who Says Sh*t. All great characters, sure, but William Shatner will always be best known for one role, and one role alone: RACK. Rural veterinary doctor Robert Ã¢â‚¬Å“RackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hansen, of course, he of the inexplicable nickname, fondness for cowboy hats, and habit of hitting on his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow by saying heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to Ã¢â‚¬Å“milk her.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A lesser man wouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve stopped with Rack, his legacy complete. Such a great, internationally beloved part, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a testament to ShatnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skill as an actor that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s escaped its shadow, the Kingdom of the Spiders conventions and catchphrases and reboots, and become known for more than just Rack. RACK. Rack. No seriously, he has people call him Rack and he thinks heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sexy cowboy. Rack.\n\nAnimals and people are dying of spider venom in RackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleepy Arizona town, and when he and a foxy out-of-towner discover a gigantic hill of venomous spiders on a local farm they somehow donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t immediately make the connection, burn it down, and end the movie. What unfolds is a creeping, ridiculous, town-destroying horror, packed with more real live tarantulas than the basement home of that spooky pale guy who sold drugs outside your high school.\n\nRack up, put on your spider-stompiest shoes, and join Mike, Bill, and Kevin in the Kingdom of the Spiders! \n\n-------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38cc76b75c6d84a3fd0281ad462efa24c9631799","amp;dn":"RiffTrax+-+Kingdom+of+Spiders+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38cc76b75c6d84a3fd0281ad462efa24c9631799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,204,118,183,92,109,132,163,253,2,129,173,70,46,250,36,201,99,23,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
