Why are some companiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ once-trusted brands now deemed worthless? Do you have to continually sell to your existing customers as though they are brand new ones?\nAfter many years of diligent research and work with a wide range of clients, consultant and speaker C. Richard Weylman has the answer to these questions.\n\nCustomers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care if a business is different or that its products are unusual. Trumpeting achievements such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“We were voted #1 again,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rated best service three years running,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re experiencedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t engage buyers emotionally. It is seller-centric thinking in a buyer-centric world.\n\nWhen customers decide where to buy, they have one thing in mind: Why should I do business with this company? Will it solve my problem, today? Buyers want to do business with companies willing to make a customer-centric promise of expected outcome: up-front and unconditional. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a slogan; it has to be in the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DNA, consistently delivered through all parts of the organization.\n\nThe Power of Why shows readers how to elevate their business performance regardless of their situation or position. Offering the same actionable, hands-on strategies Weylman has used to help companies of all sizes grow in the toughest conditions, The Power of Why is the new manual for business survival and growth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7697981836d937bb52d407025398cae6957854e1","amp;dn":"The+Power+of+Why+-+Breaking+Out+In+a+Competitive+Marketplace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7697981836d937bb52d407025398cae6957854e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,151,152,24,54,217,55,187,82,212,7,2,83,152,202,230,149,120,84,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
