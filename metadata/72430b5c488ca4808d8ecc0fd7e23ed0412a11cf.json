The fourth season, filmed in Italy, premiered on August 4, 2011.[1][2][3] MTV confirmed in June 2011 that Season 5 will return to Seaside Heights. The show debuted amid large amounts of controversy regarding the use of the words &quot;Guido/Guidette,&quot; portrayals of Italian-American stereotypes, and scrutiny from locals because the cast members were not residents of the area.[4][5][6]\n\n\n\nAll episodes are excellent HD-cam quality.\n\nSeed And Post Reply Thankyou!!\n\nBrought to you by: AbAmerican  \nQuality guarenteed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72430b5c488ca4808d8ecc0fd7e23ed0412a11cf","amp;dn":"Jersey+Shore+Season+4+%28episode+1-12%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72430b5c488ca4808d8ecc0fd7e23ed0412a11cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,67,11,92,72,140,164,128,141,142,204,15,215,226,62,208,65,42,17,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
