To prevent its population was massacred, the local king agreed to deliver to Turkish hundreds of children. Among them was his own son, Vlad Tepes (Luke Evans), who learned from the Turkish art of war. Vlad soon became famous for the ferocity in battle and also by impaling defeated. Back to Transylvania, where he was named Prince, he rules in peace for 10 years. But the king Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) again requires 100 children are delivered to the Turks. Vlad refuses and thereby starts a new war. To win it, he resorts to a being of darkness (Charles Dance) who lives in the region. After drinking his blood, Vlad becomes a vampire and gains superhuman powers.\n\nTitle in Brazil: Dracula - The Story Never Told\nOriginal title: Dracula Untold\nGenre: Action\nRunning time: 92 minutes\nDirector: Gary Shore\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829150/\n\nSize: 21:08 GB\nExtension Archive: .ISO\nVideo Quality: Blu-Ray (BD-25)\nVideo codec: H.264 / AVC\nAudio Codec: AC3 5.1 / DTS-HD MA 5.1\nResolution: 1920 x 1080\nAudio Language: Portuguese / English\nSubtitles: Portuguese / English\nInteractive Menu: Yes\n\n\nSCREENS &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jl2hqDU.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jl2hqDU.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ENqpAR1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ENqpAR1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64315cbfc2e76cc2ec135352f3fef65a82000ec","amp;dn":"Dracula+Untold+2014+BD-25+1080p+CEE+Blu-ray+AVC+DTS-HD+MA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64315cbfc2e76cc2ec135352f3fef65a82000ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,67,21,203,252,46,118,204,46,193,53,53,47,63,239,101,168,32,0,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
