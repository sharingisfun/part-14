Some of the former members had played together since 1970 in a local band called Crystal. In their most successful era (1977-1982) the line-up comprised vocalist Christian Le Bartz, bassist and vocalist &quot;Little&quot; GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard L'Her, guitarist and keyboardist Alain Maratrat, drummer and percussionist Alain Groetzinger, and keyboardist Fabrice Quagliotti went through a number of name changes, being known as Rocket Men and Rok-Etz, among others. In the year 2000 Fabrice Quagliotti decided to reform the band (initially with the name Rockets N.D.P.), but with a totally different line-up. This brought to an anomalous situation, as far as none of the former members agreed to hold a reunion. In fact, the last former member to leave the band was Alain Maratrat, in 1992.\n\nOn the Road Again is the second studio album by French space rock band Rockets, released in April 1978.\n\n    Christian Le Bartz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n    &quot;Little&quot; Gerard L'Her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, vocals, keyboards on &quot;Cosmic Race&quot;\n    Alain Maratrat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, keyboards, vocals on &quot;Space Rock&quot;, synthesizers on &quot;Astrolights&quot; and &quot;Electro-Voice&quot;\n    Fabrice Quagliotti ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards\n    Alain Groetzinger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/1676/rocketsontheroadagainfrtr1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/1676/rocketsontheroadagainfrtr1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrasckList :.\n\n- On the road again (J.Floyd/A.Wilson)\n- Cosmic race (G.L'Her)\n- Venus rapsody (A.Maratrat)\n- Space rock (Rockets)\n- Astrolights (A.Maratrat)\n- Electro-voice (A.Groetzinger)\n- Sci fi boogie (G.L'Her/C.LeBartz)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed2cfc3eded0bbfa4c4d7015b93e38016460d26e","amp;dn":"Rockets+-+On+The+Road+Again+%5BMp3+192+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed2cfc3eded0bbfa4c4d7015b93e38016460d26e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,44,252,62,222,208,187,250,76,77,112,21,185,62,56,1,100,96,210,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
