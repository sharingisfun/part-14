Most of all, it is the story of the Clearys' only daughter, Meggie, who can never possess the man she so desperately adores - Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph will rise from parish priest to the inner circles of the Vatican... but his passion for Meggie will follow him all the days of his life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:054e0ed953b3c57dfdc0a5213c73f47de3055c28","amp;dn":"The+Thorn+Birds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"054e0ed953b3c57dfdc0a5213c73f47de3055c28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,78,14,217,83,179,197,125,253,192,165,33,60,115,244,125,227,5,92,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
