There music belongs in the low-bap sub-genre of the Greek hip-hop music scene. It's characterized by slower tempo and rapping, combined with lyrics of political content. The words &quot;Low Bap&quot; don't have a specific meaning, they merely represent a perspective on life, society and politics that people in the movement have.\nThis music is really hard to find outside Greece and this is why I am sharing it. Hope you'll enjoy it.\n\n              &quot;Support your word with your life and vice versa&quot;\n\n\nMy upload speed is limited so bare with me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00b1483fd6b549ada78dde1e44a84a0c7a91ef95","amp;dn":"Active+Member","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00b1483fd6b549ada78dde1e44a84a0c7a91ef95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,177,72,63,214,181,73,173,167,141,222,30,68,168,74,12,122,145,239,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
