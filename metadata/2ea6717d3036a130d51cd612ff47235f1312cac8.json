After four years of collaboration the authors produced this incisive account of their idea of Communism, in which they envisage a society without classes, private property or a state. They argue that increasing exploitation of industrial workers will eventually lead to a revolution in which Capitalism is overthrown. This vision provided the theoretical basis of political systems in Russia, China, Cuba and Eastern Europe, affecting the lives of millions. The Communist Manifesto still remains a landmark text: a work that continues to influence and provoke debate on capitalism and class.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ea6717d3036a130d51cd612ff47235f1312cac8","amp;dn":"The+Communist+Manifesto+%28Penguin+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ea6717d3036a130d51cd612ff47235f1312cac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,166,113,125,48,54,161,48,213,28,214,18,255,71,35,95,19,18,202,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
