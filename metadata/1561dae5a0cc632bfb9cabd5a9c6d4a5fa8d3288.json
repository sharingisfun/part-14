This recording is one I found on the internet.\n\nTHE FIRST 35 SECONDS OF THIS SHOW IS REALLY POOR AUDIO QUALITY. IT BECOMES ACCEPTABLE BEFORE THE FIRST SONG.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nDr. Hook and the Medicine Show debut their song &quot;SylviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mother&quot; (at number 37). So do The Rolling Stones at number 23 with &quot;Tumbling Dice,&quot; and &quot;I Saw The Light&quot; by Todd Rundgren debuts at number 31.\n\nA listener writes, &quot;Dear Casey, What instrumental hit number 1 and stayed there the most weeks?&quot; Casey says it is a twenty two-year-old piece of music that can still be heard on television, in the late movie, in an Orson Wells picture. It was called The Third Man Theme! (also known as &quot;The Harry Lime Theme&quot;) and I've included some of it for you to hear since Casey didn't play any of it.\n\nIn another letter, a listener asks, &quot;What artist had the longest span of time between his first number one song and his last number one song?&quot; Casey says it was a span of 26 years for the legend known as Ol' Blue Eyes.\n\nAnother listener writes in to say, &quot; I once heard you say that 'Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini' but what was longest song title ever to hit number one. What was the longest song title ever to hit the top 40?&quot; Casey says it was a song by Ray Stevens whose title almost didn't leave room for the hole in the record.\n\n40:    The Diary - Bread\n39:    Every Day Of My Life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bobby Vinton\n38:    Mister CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t You See Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Buffy Sainte-Marie        \n37:    SylviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mother Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show      \n36:    Walking In The Rain With The One I Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Dramatics     \n35:    You Could Have Been A Lady Ã¢â‚¬â€œ April Wine    \n34:    Nice To Be With You - Gallery\n33:    Help Me Make It Through The Night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n32:    Roundabout - Yes\n31:    I Saw The Light Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Todd Rundgren\n30:    Jump Into The Fire - Nilsson\n29:    Taxi Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harry Chapin    \n28:    (Last Night) I DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get To Sleep At All Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The 5th Dimension\n27:    Run, Run, Run Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jo Jo Gunne\n26:    Little Bitty Pretty One Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Jackson 5\n25:    Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Simon\n24:    Candy Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sammy Davis Jr.\n23:    Tumbling Dice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Rolling Stones\n22:    Heart Of Gold Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Neil Young\n21:    Puppy Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Donny Osmond\n20:    SlippinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Into Darkness - War\n19:    Morning Has Broken Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cat Stevens\n18:    Suavecito - Malo\n17:    Hot Rod Lincoln Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Commander Cody &amp; His Lost Planet Airmen\n16:    A CowboyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Work Is Never Done Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sonny &amp; Cher\n15:    In The Rain Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Dramatics\n14:    Baby Blue - Badfinger\n13:    Castles In The Air Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Don Mclean\n12:    The Family Of Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Three Dog Night\n11:    Oh Girl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Chi-Lites\n10:    Back Off Boogaloo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ringo Starr\n9:    Look What You Done For Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Al Green\n8:    Doctor My Eyes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jackson Browne\n7:    IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Take You There Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Staple Singers\n6:    A Horse With No Name - America\n5:    Day Dreaming Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Aretha Franklin\n4:    RockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Robin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Michael Jackson\n3:    Betcha By Golly Wow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Stylistics\n2:    I Gotcha Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joe Tex\n1:    The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Roberta Flack\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1561dae5a0cc632bfb9cabd5a9c6d4a5fa8d3288","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1972_May_6th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1561dae5a0cc632bfb9cabd5a9c6d4a5fa8d3288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,97,218,229,160,204,99,43,251,156,171,213,169,198,212,165,250,141,50,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
