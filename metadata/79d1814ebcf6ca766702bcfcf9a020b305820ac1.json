Teaching scholars of intellectual history to incorporate transnational perspectives into their work, while also recommending how to confront the challenges and controversies that may arise, this original resource explains the concepts, concerns, practice, and promise of &quot;global intellectual history,&quot; featuring essays by leading scholars on various approaches that are taking shape across the discipline.\n\nThe contributors to Global Intellectual History explore the different ways in which one can think about the production, dissemination, and circulation of &quot;global&quot; ideas and ask whether global intellectual history can indeed produce legitimate narratives. They discuss how intellectuals and ideas fit within current conceptions of global frames and processes of globalization and proto-globalization, and they distinguish between ideas of the global and those of the transnational, identifying what each contributes to intellectual history. A crucial guide, this collection sets conceptual coordinates for readers eager to map an emerging area of study.
