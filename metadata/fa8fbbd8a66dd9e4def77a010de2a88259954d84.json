A covert counter-terrorist unit called Black Cell, headed by the duplicitious and suave Gabriel Shear, wants the money to help finance their raise-the-stakes vengeance war against international terrorism, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all locked away behind super-encryption. He brings in convicted hacker Stanley Jobson, who only wants to see his daughter Holly again but canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford the legal fees, to slice into the government mainframes and get the money.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244244/\nRelease Date: 17 September 2004 (USA)\nGenre: Action | Crime | Thriller\nStars: John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: BluRay.720p.x264-WiKi\nSize: 700MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa8fbbd8a66dd9e4def77a010de2a88259954d84","amp;dn":"Swordfish+%282001%29+BluRay+720p+700MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa8fbbd8a66dd9e4def77a010de2a88259954d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,143,187,216,166,109,217,228,222,247,122,1,13,226,168,130,89,149,77,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
