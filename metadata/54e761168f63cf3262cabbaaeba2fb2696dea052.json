Now, in an inspirational and entertaining rebuttal, the legendary basketball coach Bob Knight explains why Ã¢â‚¬Å“negative thinkingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will actually produce more positive results, in sports and in daily life. Coach Knight, the second-winningest coach in NCAA history with 902 victories, explains that victory is often attained by the team that makes the fewest mistakes. His coaching philosophy was to instill discipline by Ã¢â‚¬Å“preparing to winÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rather than hoping to win. That meant understanding the downside and drilling his teams to prevent the things that could go wrong. And when his teams did win, he made sure they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dwell on their success, but rather looked immediately to the challenges of the next game. He applies this lesson to business strategy as well.\n\nCoach Knight has long been inspired by his grandmotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words, &quot;If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As the first person to teach Knight about the power of negative thinking, this book is dedicated to her pragmatic spirit.
