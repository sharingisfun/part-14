And what if individually and collectively\nwe systematically misunderstand that cuase, and unwittingly perpetuate\nthe very problems we think we are trying to solve?\n\nThrough an intriguing story of parents struggling with their troubled\nchildren and with their own personal problems, The Anatomy of Peace\nshows how to get past the preconceived ideas and self-justifying\nreactions that keep us from seeing the world clearly and dealing with it\neffectively. Yusuf al-Falah, an Arab, and Avi Rozen, a Jew, each lost his\nfather at the hands of the other's ethnic cousins. As the story unfolds,\nwe discover how they came together, how they help warring parents and\nchildren to come together, and how we too can find our way out of the\nstruggles that weigh us down. The choice between peace and war lies within\nus. As one of the characters says, &quot;A solution to the inner war solves the\nouter war as well.&quot; This book offers more than hope ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it shows how we can\nprevent the conflicts that cause so much pain in our lives and in the world. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de247c09a6c8a5391477a650bb8cdc1d4e719984","amp;dn":"Anatomy+of+Peace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de247c09a6c8a5391477a650bb8cdc1d4e719984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,36,124,9,166,200,165,57,20,119,166,80,187,140,220,29,78,113,153,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
