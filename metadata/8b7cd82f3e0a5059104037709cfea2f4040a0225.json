During the Middle Ages these fortified structures were the ultimate authority in any region they were built. Both defensive and offensive, they were centres of administration, symbols of power as well as concentrations of military might. But what was it that made each successful? Through dynamic location footage and immersive visual effects, this six episode series reveals the bloody history behind these fortifications and the weapons designed to defeat them. Each episode will climax with the ultimate test of each castle's strength: examining the epic battle that changed the course of history.\n\n\n\n5)  Malbork Castle \nStretched along the bank of the River Nogat in modern-day Poland, Malbork Castle was built by an elite group knights during the Baltic Crusades. Its distinct brick architecture, soaring walls, and deadly battlements were built to intimidate the local population. In 1410, a pagan-turned-king marches on the castle, determined to put an end to the Teutonic Order's reign.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8581/battlecastlescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8581/battlecastlescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2460/battlecastlescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2460/battlecastlescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/9826/battlecastlescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/9826/battlecastlescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/23/battlecastlescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/23/battlecastlescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6648/battlecastlescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6648/battlecastlescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/989/battlecastlescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/989/battlecastlescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6854/battlecastlescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6854/battlecastlescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4091/battlecastlescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4091/battlecastlescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2690/battlecastlescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2690/battlecastlescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2092 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 44mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://battlecastle.tv/?meta=home#series&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://battlecastle.tv/?meta=home#series&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b7cd82f3e0a5059104037709cfea2f4040a0225","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Battle+Castle+with+Dan+Snow+5of6+Malbork+Castle+PDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b7cd82f3e0a5059104037709cfea2f4040a0225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,124,216,47,62,10,80,89,16,64,55,112,156,254,162,244,4,10,2,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
