Thinking she's sneaking into her crush's bedroom at an all-night college party, she ends up sleeping with her older brother's best friend. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only when the sun comes up that she recognizes Holden Bellamy. Mortified, Gabrielle leaves to train with a renowned chef in France, vowing never to return to her hometown and the awkwardness of her one night stand mix-up. But several years later, she finds herself doing just that, and she runs smack into the delicious man who makes her catch her breath.\n\nHolden Bellamy, owner of Belle Ami, a critically acclaimed vineyard, has always had a thing for his best friend's little sister...even if she was off limits. Waking up to her in the morning several years back was a remarkable surprise, one that crashed and burned when she left town without a word. Now he's face to face with the woman he never stopped wondering about.\n\nThe attraction between Gabrielle and Holden still sizzles on the surface even after all these years... Having just experienced serious breakups, neither one is ready to start again. Instead, they make a rebound pact. Casual sex, no strings attachedÃ¢â‚¬â€and rule #1? Don't fall in love. Problem is, with each scorching encounter, Gabrielle and Holden find themselves falling hard and fast.\n\n\nA KILTED CHRISTMAS WISH is a sexy, contemporary novella of about 20,000 words. \n\nDown on her luck with men, Darla Strider wonders if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever meet her own kilted hero. Considering she lives in present day New York City, the likelihood of that happening is nil. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain only a Christmas wish could make her dreams come true. Until the day Aaron Sutherland walks into her cafÃƒÂ©, and changes her whole world. \n\nLeaving his pain in Scotland for life in the States, the last thing Aaron has in mind is hooking up with a city girl. But one look at Darla and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got him singing All I Want for Christmas is You.\n\n\n\nNotes: \n\nA Kilted Christmas Wish - The epub was tested using the Aldiko application for Samsung and the desktop PC Calibre application.\nThe azw file can be read by both Kindle for Samsung and Kindle for PC.\nThe mobi file can be read by both Kindle for Samsung and PC, and Calibre for PC.\n\nThe Rebound Pact Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Epub read fine with Aldiko on the Samsung Note 10.1 and in Calibre on the desktop.
