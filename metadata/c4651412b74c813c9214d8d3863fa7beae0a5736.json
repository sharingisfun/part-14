Banks, &quot;Slicing Pizzas, Racing Turtles, and Further Adventures in Applied Mathematics&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 00691154996 | 2012 | EPUB | 304 pages | 6,9 MB\n\nHave you ever daydreamed about digging a hole to the other side of the world? Robert Banks not only entertains such ideas but, better yet, he supplies the mathematical know-how to turn fantasies into problem-solving adventures. In this sequel to the popular Towing Icebergs, Falling Dominoes (Princeton, 1998), Banks presents another collection of puzzles for readers interested in sharpening their thinking and mathematical skills. The problems range from the wondrous to the eminently practical. In one chapter, the author helps us determine the total number of people who have lived on earth; in another, he shows how an understanding of mathematical curves can help a thrifty lover, armed with construction paper and scissors, keep expenses down on Valentine's Day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4651412b74c813c9214d8d3863fa7beae0a5736","amp;dn":"Slicing+Pizzas%2C++Further+Adventures+in+Applied+Mathematics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4651412b74c813c9214d8d3863fa7beae0a5736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,101,20,18,183,76,129,60,146,20,216,211,134,63,167,190,174,10,87,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
