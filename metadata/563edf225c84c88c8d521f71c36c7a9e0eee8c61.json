With so many different translations available, how can there be a famine for the Word? Has the text been altered? Les tells of deletions and additions since 1881, which dovetail into New Age teaching. See how they remove the deity of Jesus and include other religions as &quot;other paths&quot; to God. Documented are the thousands of words, verses, and doctrines by which new versions will prepare the apostate churches of these last days to accept the religion and the mark of the beast.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nLes Garrett currently lives in Tasmania. He has served as a pastor for thirty years. He also spent ten years lecturing at the Hebron Bible College, Perth. He has been involved in pioneering several churches and has travelled throughout the world, ministering in conventions and churches in Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, Canada, USA, Ireland, India, South Africa and Southeast Asia. In 1967 the Lord gave Les Garrett a song which in later years has become one of the world's best known scripture songs, &quot;This is the Day&quot;, which has been published, sung and recorded by individuals and groups in many nations and in many languages.\n\nAmong the books Les has written which have been widely read and acclaimed are Which Bible Can We Trust?, Concordance of the Destruction of Two or Three Witnesses, and Westcott and Hort and the Occult Connection . His books and teaching tapes are highly recommended by many well known teachers and authors like David Otis Fuller and Gail Riplinger. His main teaching themes are the comparison of Bible translations and the revival of Christianity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:563edf225c84c88c8d521f71c36c7a9e0eee8c61","amp;dn":"Which+n+We+Trust%3F+-+Les+Garrett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"563edf225c84c88c8d521f71c36c7a9e0eee8c61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,62,223,34,92,132,200,140,141,82,31,113,195,108,122,158,14,238,140,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
