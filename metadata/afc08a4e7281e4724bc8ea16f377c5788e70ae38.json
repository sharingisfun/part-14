An increasingly bluesy flavor began to color the songwriting and arrangements, especially on the party'n'booze anthem &quot;Roadhouse Blues.&quot; Airy mysticism was still present on &quot;Waiting for the Sun,&quot; &quot;Queen of the Highway,&quot; and &quot;Indian Summer&quot;; &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; and &quot;Land Ho!&quot; struck effective balances between the hard rock arrangements and the narrative reach of the lyrics. &quot;Peace Frog&quot; was the most political and controversial track, documenting the domestic unrest of late-'60s America before unexpectedly segueing into the restful ballad &quot;Blue Sunday.&quot; &quot;The Spy,&quot; by contrast, was a slow blues that pointed to the direction that would fully blossom on L.A. Woman. - Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1. Roadhouse Blues\n2. Waiting For The Sun\n3. You Make Me Real\n4. Peace Frog\n5. Blue Sunday\n6. Ship Of Fools\n7. Land Ho!\n8.
