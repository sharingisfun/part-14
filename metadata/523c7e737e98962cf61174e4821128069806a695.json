Originally a new wave synthpop outfit, Ministry changed its style to industrial metal in the late 1980s. Ministry found mainstream success in the early 1990s with its most successful album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs (1992) and touring as part of the Lollapalooza festival.\n\nAfter 27 years of performing, Jourgensen decided to end the band in 2008, saying a reunion would never happen. However, in August 2011, a reunion was announced, when Ministry confirmed they would play one of their first shows in four years at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2012. Ministry released a new album, Relapse, on March 23, 2012, which was followed by a world tour\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523c7e737e98962cf61174e4821128069806a695","amp;dn":"Ministry-+Complete+Discography+%281983-2013%29FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523c7e737e98962cf61174e4821128069806a695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,60,126,115,126,152,150,44,246,17,116,228,130,17,40,6,152,6,166,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
