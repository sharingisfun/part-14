The series was created by JosÃƒÂ© Rivera and Karl Schaefer, with Joe Dante serving ascreative consultant.\n\nThe series revolves around Marshall Teller, a young boy whose family moves to the desolate town of Eerie, Indiana, population of 16,661. While moving into his new home, he meets Simon Holmes, one of the few normal people in Eerie. Together, they are faced with bizarre scenarios, which include discovering a sinister group of intelligent dogs that are planning on taking over the world, and meeting a tornado hunter who is reminiscent of Captain Ahab. They also confront numerous urban legends such as Bigfoot and a still-living Elvis Presley. Although the show was host to a plethora of jokes, it also featured a serious X-Files-like tone. After thirteen episodes, one of which did not air during the network run, the series was retooled with Jason Marsden's &quot;Dash X&quot; added to the cast and Archie Hahn's Mr. Radford is revealed to be an imposter, with John Astin revealed to be the &quot;actual&quot; Mr. Radford. The final produced episode was a tongue-in-cheek, fourth wall breaking sequence of events depicting Dash X's attempts to take over as star of the show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:017776ea49b7815215e025a0f011a4fdbe3f8656","amp;dn":"Eerie+Indiana+and+The+Other+Dimension+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"017776ea49b7815215e025a0f011a4fdbe3f8656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,119,118,234,73,183,129,82,21,224,37,160,240,17,164,253,190,63,134,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
