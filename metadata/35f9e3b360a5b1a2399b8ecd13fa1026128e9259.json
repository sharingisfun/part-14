Instead, she maintains her own impressive balance among jazz standards, other popular songs, and originals, and among a &quot;jazz&quot; approach, a guitar-based country blues spareness, and art-pop inspired by one of her greatest influences, Joni Mitchell. Here she reminds us that she can bring tremendous freshness to standards. Star pianist Jacky Terrasson makes it almost easy for her. His standout contribution, though, is a tinkling, decidedly late-autumnal solo &quot;Autumn Leaves.&quot; Bassist Lonnie Plaxico and percussionist Mino Cinelu contribute impressively on a trap-setless disc, on such numbers as a sad-soul &quot;Tea for Two,&quot; and a slowed, bluesy rendition of &quot;Tennessee Waltz.&quot;\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3350/72112be3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3350/72112be3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n      1.
