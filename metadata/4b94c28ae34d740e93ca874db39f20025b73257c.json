Secret Ceremony\n\nPersonnel:\nMike Patton: Vocals\nJoey Baron: Drums\nTrevor Dunn: Bass\nJohn Medeski: Organ\n\nOver a year in the making, the 6th CD in the Moonchild legacy is a testament-tribute to the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon, the legendary crusading Warrior-Monks whose 200-year rise to power ended abruptly in 1307 under accusations of heresy. With lyrics opening a new world of possibilities, the music exudes a powerful emotional intensity. Patton's versatility is at its peak, and he sings everything from Gregorian Chants and atonal melodies to hardcore screams and passionate whispers. The evocative organ of John Medeski adds a deeply religious tone to the drama, and the Dunn-Baron rhythm section is at its raging best!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b94c28ae34d740e93ca874db39f20025b73257c","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Templars%3A+In+Sacred+Blood+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b94c28ae34d740e93ca874db39f20025b73257c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,148,194,138,227,77,116,14,147,202,135,77,179,159,32,2,91,115,37,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
