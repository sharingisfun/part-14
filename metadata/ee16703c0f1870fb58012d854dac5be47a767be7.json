Singer/guitarist Brian Briggs, keyboardist/string player Jonathan Ouin, bassist Ollie Steadman, and drummer Rob Steadman (a pair of brothers from South Africa) formed the band while they were attending Oxford University; the well-studied band includes an ornithologist and a Russian translator among its ranks. The band debuted its jangly, largely acoustic sound -- which has drawn comparisons to James, Belle &amp; Sebastian and XTC -- with a self-titled EP that included the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zorbing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was inspired by and named after the sport of rolling down a hill in a transparent sphere. \n\n  Another early single was 2007Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Good Fish Guide,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a musical list of which fish are plentiful to eat and which are endangered; its profits went to the Marine Conservation Society. Stornoway continued to refine their sound and had a breakthrough 2009: they headlined the BBC Introducing stage at BBC Radio 1Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Big Weekend that May and officially released &quot;Zorbing,&quot; which included BriggsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ brother Adam on trumpet, as a single that July. That summer, they also played festivals including Glastonbury, and wrote a tour journal for the Daily Telegraph. Their second single, &quot;Unfaithful,&quot; which featured violin courtesy of touring member Rahul Satija, arrived that September, a month before StornowayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first headlining tour of the U.K. The band closed out the year by making the longlist for the BBCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sounds of 2010 poll.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee16703c0f1870fb58012d854dac5be47a767be7","amp;dn":"Stornoway+-+Tales+From+Terra+Firma+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee16703c0f1870fb58012d854dac5be47a767be7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,22,112,60,15,24,112,251,88,1,45,133,77,172,91,228,122,118,123,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
