I. Kopylov. \n\n    This book tells a fascinating story of one of physics today: the discovery of primary building blocks of matter. This field of science is called particle or high-energy physics and is one of the frontiers of present day physical research.\n\n    How is it possible to detect particles a hundred thousand times smaller than the atom, which itself is many times smaller than an apple as the apple is smaller than the Earth? How can we follow motion of particles that have velocity almost that of light? How can we measure the lifetime of these particles when it is of the order of 0.00000000000000000000001 second? What kind of clock can we ;'use? How can we investigate the properties of these astonishing and elusive bits of matter?\n\n    All these and many other questions are comprehensively answered in this book written for the layman by the late Dr. Gersten Kopylov, who was a prominent scientist, well known in the world of particle physics. This book was written to be understood even by readers having only a secondary school education and it requires a knowledge of only  elementary algebra and geometry. Nevertheless in the author's treatment , the material is no way oversimplified or distorted.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by Nicholas Weinstein and was first published by Mir in 1983.\n\n\nPDF | 10.3 MB | OCR | Bookmarked | 600 dpi | Paginated | Cover | Pages: 272\n\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\n\nContents\n\nPart One Kinematics for the Lyrical\n\nChapter 1 What It's All About 9\nChapter 2 Mores in the Subatomic World 13\nChapter 3 Energy and Momentum of Fast Particles 26\nChapter 4 More on Energy and Momentum 41\nChapter 5 Conservation of Energy and Momentum 63\nChapter 6 Kinematics in the World of Accelerators 82\nChapter 7 How Particles Are Discovered 92\nChapter 8 How Resonance Particles Are Discovered 112\n\nPart Two Kinematics for the Schoolboy\n\nChapter 9 The Momenta Hedgehog 135\nChapter 10 What Colour Are Elementary Particles? 145\nChapter 11 Relativistic Transformations of the Momenta Hedgehog 154\nChapter 12 The Story of How the  Ãâ‚¬0 Meson Was Found in Cosmic Rays 178\nChapter 13 2 + 3 = 23 200\nChapter 14 Three-Photon Cone 216\nChapter 15 &quot; ...With a Faint Wave of the Hand...&quot; 228\nChapter 16 To Our Regret, the Last Chapter 246\n\nConclusions 263\n\nIndex 268","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adb1e95522b8232e0e3360ef3ca0c0f96b091eae","amp;dn":"Kopylov+-+Elementary+Kinematics+of+Elementary+Particles+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adb1e95522b8232e0e3360ef3ca0c0f96b091eae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,177,233,85,34,184,35,46,14,51,96,239,60,160,192,249,107,9,30,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
