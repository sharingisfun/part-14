Oddly enough, the two brothers have recorded together very infrequently during their long careers, so this opportunity must have been special to them. The opening track signals a different direction for the group, with Elvin's explosive solo stealing the show in &quot;Autumn Leaves.&quot; The pianist's imaginative arrangement of &quot;Yesterdays&quot; begins as a stunning solo before Davis' sparse bass and Elvin's brushes join him. The buoyant treatment of Kenny Dorham's &quot;Blue Bossa&quot; finds Hank in a humorous mood, inserting several brief quotes from well-known works such as &quot;Hot House&quot; and &quot;Blue Skies.&quot; The trio is clearly cooking by the time it recorded the percolating take of Oliver Nelson's &quot;Six and Four.&quot; Hopefully, this delightful date by The Great Jazz Trio will result in a follow-up recording session.
