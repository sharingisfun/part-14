It was withdrawn from circulation when the communist regime was established. In the early 1950s, Hrabal was a member of an underground literary group run by JiÃ…â„¢ÃƒÂ­ KolÃƒÂ¡Ã…â„¢, an artist, poet, critic and central figure in Czechoslovak culture.\n\nHrabal's two best-known novels are Closely Observed Trains (1965) and I Served the King of England, both of which were made into movies by the Czech director, JiÃ…â„¢ÃƒÂ­ Menzel (1966 and 2006, respectively). Hrabal worked closely with Menzel on the script for Closely Observed Trains which won an Oscar in 1968. He wrote in an expressive, highly visual style. He affected the use of long sentences; in fact his works Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age (1964) and Vita Nuova (1987) consist of one single sentence. Political quandaries and their concomitant moral ambiguities are a recurrent theme. Many of Hrabal's characters are portrayed as &quot;wise fools&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ simpletons with occasional inadvertently profound thoughts Ã¢â‚¬â€ who are also given to coarse humour, lewdness, and a determination to survive and enjoy oneself despite harsh circumstances. Much of the impact of Hrabal's writing derives from his juxtaposition of the beauty and cruelty found in everyday life. Vivid depictions of pain human beings casually inflict on animals (as in the scene where families of mice are caught in a paper compactor) symbolise the pervasiveness of cruelty among human beings. The adult human world is revealed as terrifying, and, in the end, perhaps the only sane philosophy is a line delivered in Closely Observed Trains: &quot;You should have stayed home on your arse&quot;. His characterisations also can be comic, giving his prose a baroque/mediaeval tinge.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Closely Watched Trains\n\n* Dancing Lessons for the Advanced Age\n\n* Harlequin's Millions\n\n* I Served the King of England\n\n* The Little Town Where Time Stood Still\n\n* Too Loud a Solitude\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohumil_Hrabal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohumil_Hrabal&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/15/bohumil-hrabal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/15/bohumil-hrabal&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:366fb88844986a5b28f257c406f787f453137884","amp;dn":"Bohumil+Hrabal+-+Czech+Writer+%286+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"366fb88844986a5b28f257c406f787f453137884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,111,184,136,68,152,106,91,40,242,87,196,6,247,135,244,83,19,120,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
