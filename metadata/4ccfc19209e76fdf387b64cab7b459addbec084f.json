The Trinity Accord promises a new era of cooperation between disparate races and groups. It is a beacon of hope held together by many hands: old enemies, new allies, wary loners.\r\n\r\nBut a century of distrust and suspicion canâ€™t be so easily forgotten, and it threatens to shatter Trinity from within at any moment. As rival members vie for dominance, chaos and evil gather in the shadows and a kidnapped womanâ€™s cry for help washes up in San Francisco, while the Consortium turns its murderous gaze toward a child who is the embodiment of change, of love, of piercing hope: a child who is both Psyâ€¦and changeling. \r\n\r\nTo find the lost and protect the vulnerableâ€”and to save Trinityâ€”no one can stand alone. This is a time of loyalty across divisions, of bonds woven into the heart and the soul, of heroes known and unknown standing back to back and holding the line. But is an allegiance of honor even possible with traitors lurking in their midst?\r\n\r\n*Publishers Weekly on Shards of Hope","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ccfc19209e76fdf387b64cab7b459addbec084f","amp;dn":"Allegiance+of+Honor+%28PsyChangelings%29+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ccfc19209e76fdf387b64cab7b459addbec084f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,207,193,146,9,231,111,223,56,123,100,202,183,180,89,173,219,236,8,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
