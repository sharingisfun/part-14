It is one of the best-known texts from the Theravada (Way of the Elders) tradition of Buddhism.\n\nManual of Zen Buddhism is by D. T. Suzuki (1870 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1966). He was a Japanese author of books and essays on Buddhism, Zen and Shin that were instrumental in spreading interest in both Zen and Far Eastern philosophy in general to the West. Suzuki was also a prolific translator of Chinese, Japanese, and Sanskrit literature.\n\nThese two texts make a good combination. The Dhammapada is one of the oldest Buddhist texts in the oldest Buddhist tradition. Suzuki's manual is a modern text, introducing Zen.\n\nThere are many Buddhsist texts available online for free download, but they are mostly in PDF format. I hope we can get more Buddhist texts in MOBI or Kindle format.\n\nTake what you want, enjoy what you take, please seed, and check my torrents for other books on spirituality. \n\nA torrent for the Dhammapada in English and Pali, audio and text is available here - &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6484946&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6484946&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAn archive of Zen and Pureland Buddhist texts is here - &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6479515&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6479515&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24c3044a1a59bd8e387f9f0b742601393566e753","amp;dn":"Two+Buddhist+Texts+%28MOBI+%2F+Kindle%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24c3044a1a59bd8e387f9f0b742601393566e753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,195,4,74,26,89,189,142,56,127,159,11,116,38,1,57,53,102,231,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
