They are best known for the 1970s hit singles they recorded as a duo.\n\n&quot;Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep&quot; (&quot;Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep&quot; had originally been a hit in Europe as performed by Middle of the Road) \n&quot;Sugar Candy Kisses&quot; \n&quot;Don't Do It Baby&quot; \n&quot;Like a Butterfly&quot; \n&quot;The Two Of Us&quot;. \n&quot;Your Kiss is Sweet&quot;\n \nAfter their easy listening, bubblegum pop music career receded in the mid 1970s, both Kissoons were in demand as backing singers and session musicians.

Katie Kissoon's career has continued strong as backup singer for such notables as Van Morrison (1978 and later), Eric Clapton (1986 and later), Roger Waters (since 1984), Elton John (1985), George Harrison (1991), Pet Shop Boys, (1994) and Robbie Williams (2002 and later).\n\nIn 1997 Mac and Katie Kissoon released an album of new material called From Now On.\n\nIn 2002, Katie Kissoon appeared onstage at the Concert for George. In 2006-2007, she was also part of the back up section for Roger Waters' The Dark Side of the Moon Live world tour. The tour continued for 9 dates in 2008, but Katie was unable to perform and was replaced by Sylvia Mason-James.\n\nKatie Kissoon recently performed backup vocals on three tracks on Van Morrison's 2008 album, Keep It Simple and she sang with his band on several dates in 2008.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47b787d4b9c6bc42dfa6a8cc2d4192674411e7be","amp;dn":"Mac+%26+Katie+Kissoon+-+The+Very+Best+of+...+%5B1993%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47b787d4b9c6bc42dfa6a8cc2d4192674411e7be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,183,135,212,185,198,188,66,223,166,168,204,45,65,146,103,68,17,231,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
