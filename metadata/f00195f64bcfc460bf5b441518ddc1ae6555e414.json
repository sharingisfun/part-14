It's about as noir as it gets, in my book (taking the great definition from one of the guys over at Rara-Avis that hardboiled = tough, while noir = screwed). Henry Fonda is quite astonishing in a role that takes him from average Joe to suicidal killer. I think it's one of his very best performances, and I'm a GREAT admirer of his other performances. Barbara Bel Geddes is mousy but real as the naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve young woman Fonda falls for. The only problem I had with the movie was Vincent Price's performance of an overwritten role. On one hand, it's exactly the kind of role Price normally excels in, but it's far too florid and phony for this kind of film. Watching his scenes with Fonda, it's like watching two movies at the same time--when the camera's on Price, it's &quot;Forever Amber.&quot; When the camera's on Fonda, it's &quot;Out of the Past.&quot; For the perfect version of this kind of pseudo-ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ber-sophisticate in a noir setting, one need only look to Clifton Webb in &quot;Laura.&quot; Webb made that character live and breath. Price orates. With his fey ways and foppish hairdo, he grated on my nerves. The character should very well do so in this film, but to me it was Price and the scripting of his character that were grating. But that's a mere cavil. This is a splendid film, digging as sort of an ancestor to &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; into the rot beneath the seemingly every day--the difference being that most of the people who populate the edges of this movie seem to be very decent and honorable. Anatole Litvak's direction and Sol Polito's brilliant photography surprised me\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f00195f64bcfc460bf5b441518ddc1ae6555e414","amp;dn":"The+Long+Night+%28Vincent+Price%2C+Henry+Fonda%29+%5B1947%5D+%40+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f00195f64bcfc460bf5b441518ddc1ae6555e414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,1,149,246,75,207,196,96,191,91,68,21,24,221,193,174,101,85,228,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
