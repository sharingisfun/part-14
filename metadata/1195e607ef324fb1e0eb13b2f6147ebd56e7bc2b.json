The film surprised me. I thought I would leave a comment because this film has so few reviews. This was a very romantic torture porn with a crazy woman who runs a restaurant and slashes her customers' or adversaries' calves and puts them up on meathooks as if Leatherface. But this is not The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and this is not Saw or Guinea Pig.\n\nThe film is worth watching for the visuals and great operatic music. The primary colors of blood and blue are saturated and the director makes what is boring about these types of movies vibrant. It is very eye magnetic.\n\nI have found torture pornographies to be very dull and exploitative in a way that I do not like (e.g. Hostel 2), but this was different. And it is one of only three Thai horror films that I like. Check it out. \n\n\nThis film is in Thai language with English subtitles.\n\nIMDB info: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1603808/\n\n\nDont forget, same as always guys, comment, seed and enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1195e607ef324fb1e0eb13b2f6147ebd56e7bc2b","amp;dn":"The+Meat+Grinder+%282009%29+-+DVDRip+%28With+Eng+Subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1195e607ef324fb1e0eb13b2f6147ebd56e7bc2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,149,230,7,239,50,79,177,224,235,19,178,246,20,126,189,86,231,188,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
