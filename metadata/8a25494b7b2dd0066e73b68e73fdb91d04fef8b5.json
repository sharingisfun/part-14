Jean Fain tells us it's about cultivating awareness and self-acceptance wherever you are. With The Self-Compassion Diet, this Harvard Medical School-affiliated psychotherapist prescribes a practical program for transforming the way you think and feel about food and your whole self--a shift that, paradoxically, inspires physical change. Combining loving-kindness, self-hypnosis, and other winning weight-loss strategies, The Self Compassion Diet is available in two complementary formats to help you naturally progress toward genuine self-acceptance and a healthy, sustainable weight. \n\nWith more than 30 different tools including quizzes, breathing exercises, and visualizations, the book explores four powerful weight-loss methods. The audio edition guides you through 11 key practices described in the book. Used together, this powerful combination can speed learning and boost success. Additional topics include: 1) how to appreciate the everyday activity of eating, and learn to trust your body's signals that it's nourished 2) Gradual change: a guided visualization for developing mindful eating habits 3) a meditation for getting to know the diet coach who knows you best--your compassionate &quot;inner advisor.&quot; &quot;Most dieters try to 'kill cravings' and break habits with self-discipline,&quot; teaches Fain. &quot;Self-kindness can help quiet the shame that traditional diets instill, and establish a harmonious relationship with food.&quot; The Self Compassion Diet book and audio offer a treasury of heart-opening mind-body teachings and practices for improving the way you live, breathe, and eat.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYT34fnXL._SS500_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYT34fnXL._SS500_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n[b][quote][color=Red]\n\nHometown Get-Togethers: Memorable Meals for Great Gatherings \n\n\n\nW..iam M.rrow C0okbooks \nCandace Floyd, Jill Melton\n2008 \nENGLISH\nISBN: 0061257907\n345 Pages \nPDF ,Epub, Mobi \n7.85 MB\n\n\nGather 'round, pull up a chair, and join family, friends, and your local community to swap some of the best reader-submitted recipes from American Profile.

When and where food became more plentiful, people were able to be more discerning about what they wanted to eat. Personal ethics and preferences guided peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dietary decisions. They still do today, but a host of factorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including technology, farming methods, and environmental issuesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½make the decision of what to eat much more complex. Moreover, vegetarian and non-vegetarian groups have splintered into countless subgroups that support various specialized eating philosophies.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a25494b7b2dd0066e73b68e73fdb91d04fef8b5","amp;dn":"The+5-Factor+World+Diet+%2CMemorable+Meals+for+Great+Gatherings+%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a25494b7b2dd0066e73b68e73fdb91d04fef8b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,37,73,75,123,45,208,6,110,115,182,142,115,253,185,29,4,254,248,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
