The final details were wrapped up in June of 2011. The same crew that made Acetylene and most of the other Walkabouts albums, made this one: Carla Torgerson, Terri Moeller, Michael Wells, Glenn Slater and Chris Eckman. Paul Austin formerly of Willard Grant Conspiracy and Transmissionary Six joined us, providing new angles and possibilities. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Travels in the DustlandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a collection of interconnected songs. It is a song cycle. The Dustland is a made up place but it looks acts like a real place. Whiledifferent characters come and go throughout the songs, the most important character is the landscape itself: Its vastness, its endless skies, its scarcity,its hidden opportunities and its rugged dead-end roads.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87633444bd56bf7ced6875cb76725f2ba5a2b6eb","amp;dn":"The+Walkabouts+-+Travels+In+The+Dustland+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87633444bd56bf7ced6875cb76725f2ba5a2b6eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,99,52,68,189,86,191,124,237,104,117,203,118,114,95,43,165,162,182,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
