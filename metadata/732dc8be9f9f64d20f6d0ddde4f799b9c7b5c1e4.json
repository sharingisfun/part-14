But on the other that simply disregards the sturdy trunk of work they?ve built up since. A revitalised Proclaimers have in recent years been creeping up on festival crowds hanging about waiting for the hits, and unexpectedly enthralling them with hand-chiselled choruses and wild, windswept gusto--seventh album Life with You is accordingly the perfect accompaniment to more familiar distractions. Throughout 13 muscular tracks they strike Motown, folk, blues and rock ?n? roll sparks into heartfelt, melodic pop blazes bellowed by that deliciously thick Scottish brogue. &quot;Here It Comes Again&quot; is a frenzied highlight, bouncing off the walls like a yo-yoing Joe Cocker cameo in The Commitments, and &quot;In Recognition&quot; and &quot;Whole Wide World&quot; are true anthems both, building from that familiar muted acoustic foundation, the former illustrating the clawing wit that sometimes pervades their writing and the latter an adorable chest-beating love song. The Proclaimers are very much still walking. --James Berry \n\nDescription\nFollowing on from 2005&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Restless Soul&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Life With You&amp;#039; is the seventh studio album from the bespectacled Scottish folk rock legends. Produced by Steve Evans (The Waterboys, Thea Gilmore), this release features thirteen brand new tracks which demonstrate the band&amp;#039;s trademark blend of intelligent songwriting, emotive lyrical subject matter and impossibly catchy choruses, the result of which is a triumphant return to form for the twins. Includes the singles &amp;#039;Life With You&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Whole Wide World.&amp;#039; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:732dc8be9f9f64d20f6d0ddde4f799b9c7b5c1e4","amp;dn":"The+Proclaimers+-+Life+With+You+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"732dc8be9f9f64d20f6d0ddde4f799b9c7b5c1e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,45,200,190,159,159,100,210,15,109,13,221,228,247,153,185,199,181,193,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
