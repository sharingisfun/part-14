It is an astonishing series of recordings. At times I found myself facing the darkest of the dark in the collective unconscious. Just as I thought I had reached the edge of where I could go in my voyaging, a tonal shift would occur and carry me into a delicious and heart-achingly beautiful space of unparalleled hope and faith. These recordings are both initiatory, and a veritable soul-retrieval in this time of widespread soul loss. In essence, this is healing sound. Arranged as a collection of four discs, each is a stand-alone musicscape experience. Yet, as a full collection MYSTIC CHORDS &amp; SACRED SPACES is nothing short of initiation, each disk building upon the energy of the previous one, opening out into vast domains and vistas, carrying us deep into subterranean realms of luminosity. MYSTIC CHORDS &amp; SACRED SPACES is a vibrant topography, a map leading us to the dwelling places of sentient and divine energy.\\&quot; -- Frank MacEowen, author of From the Celtic Dreamtime, The Mist-Filled Path, and Chasing The Deer\n\nPreviews of the tracks can be found here:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?albumID=247&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?albumID=247&lt;/a&gt;\n------------\n\nHope this torrent works, my first one ever. I only got 25k Upload, but it&amp;#039;s worth the wait if you like ambient.\nEnjoy! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae6d808f631c21390e72c51ff7b16bd9e8617e6e","amp;dn":"Steve+Roach+-+Mystic+Chords+%26+Sacred+Spaces+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae6d808f631c21390e72c51ff7b16bd9e8617e6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,109,128,143,99,28,33,57,14,114,197,31,247,177,107,217,232,97,126,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
