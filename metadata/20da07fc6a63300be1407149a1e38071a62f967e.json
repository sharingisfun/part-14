The book will focus on these aspects and will benefit from the contribution of several world-famous scientists from mathematics and related sciences, such as: Ralph Abraham, Andrew Crumey, Peter Markowich, Claudio Procesi, Clive Ruggles, Ismail Serageldin, Amin Shokrollahi, Tobias Wallisser","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20da07fc6a63300be1407149a1e38071a62f967e","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+MATHKNOW+Mathematics%2C+Applied+Science+and+Real+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20da07fc6a63300be1407149a1e38071a62f967e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,218,7,252,106,99,48,11,225,64,113,73,161,227,128,113,166,47,150,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
