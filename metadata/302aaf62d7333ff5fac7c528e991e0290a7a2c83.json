To make matters even worse, many people are intimidated by science and subsequently are hesitant to even discuss the creation/evolution debate.\nLet There Be Light takes the intimidation away and gives the reader a much better understanding of the controversy, revealing that true science always confirms the trustworthiness of Scripture. Believers will have their faith greatly strengthened, while skeptics will be graciously and seriously challenged.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nJay Seegert is the Co-Founder and Executive Director of the Creation Education Center (CECwisc.com). He holds degrees in Physics and Engineering and has been lecturing on Creation/Evolution &amp; the authority of Scripture for over 26 years.
