Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, was completed in 1702 and is an architectural gem, one of the most beautiful examples of a short-lived but glorious style known as the English Baroque. Work on the house was begun by Sir Christopher Wren and finished by his mysterious protege, Nicholas Hawksmoor. Who designed what, and precisely when, has become a long-running debate. But it's one that, in this programme, is finally put to bed. Easton Neston's ingenious construction is just one of the secrets hidden behind its elegant facade - the building has had a colourful history. In modern times, it has hosted a Formula One racing team and it is now the headquarters of a global fashion brand.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2892/thecountryhouserevealed.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1567 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 464\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.793 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-country-house-revealed-a-secret-history-of-the-british-ancestral-home-by-dan-cruickshank-2265621.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-country-house-revealed-a-secret-history-of-the-british-ancestral-home-by-dan-cruickshank-2265621.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cc9193d3791523d905894faa9963ba0205669f4","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Country+House+Revealed+3of6+Easton+Neston+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cc9193d3791523d905894faa9963ba0205669f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,201,25,61,55,145,82,61,144,88,148,250,169,150,59,160,32,86,105,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
