In The Godfather Doctrine, John Hulsman and Wess Mitchell show how the aging and wounded don is emblematic of cold-war American power on the decline in a new world where our enemies play by unfamiliar rules, and how the don's heirs uncannily exemplify the three leading schools of American foreign policy today. Tom, the left-of-center liberal institutionalist, thinks the old rules still apply and that negotiation is the answer. Sonny is the Bush-era neocon who shoots first and asks questions later, proving an easy target for his enemies. Only Michael, the realist, has a sure feel for the changing scene, recognizing the need for flexible combinations of soft and hard power to keep the family strong and maintain its influence and security in a dangerous and rapidly changing world.\n\nBased on Hulsman and Mitchell's groundbreaking and widely debated article, &quot;Pax Corleone,&quot; The Godfather Doctrine explains for everyone why Francis Ford Coppola's epic story about a Mafia dynasty holds key insights for ensuring America's survival in the twenty-first century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5747486c424dcdec38b3c7c8134b39f136dfecbc","amp;dn":"The+Godfather+Doctrine%3A+A+Foreign+Policy+Parable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5747486c424dcdec38b3c7c8134b39f136dfecbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,71,72,108,66,77,205,236,56,179,199,200,19,75,57,241,54,223,236,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
