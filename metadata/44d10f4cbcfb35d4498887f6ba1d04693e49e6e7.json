That they acquitted themselves so well in the face of bureaucratic meddling, poor supply and appalling climatic conditions, speaks highly of the tenacity and physical toughness of the volunteers who served in the West during campaigns such as the Comanche Campaign (1867-1875), the Red River War (1874-1875), the Nez Perce War (1877), and the Ghost Dance War (1890-1891) among others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44d10f4cbcfb35d4498887f6ba1d04693e49e6e7","amp;dn":"US+Cavalryman+1865-90","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44d10f4cbcfb35d4498887f6ba1d04693e49e6e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,209,15,76,188,251,53,212,73,136,135,246,186,29,4,105,62,73,230,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
