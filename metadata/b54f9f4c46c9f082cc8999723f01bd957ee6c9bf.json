Since the release of What If Leaving Is A Loving Thing    |\n|  in the spring of 2007 the album has been in the sales charts for over a   |\n|  year straight and is now certified platinum. The single Cheek To Cheek    |\n|  has reached gold status and was the most played song on national radio    |\n|  in Sweden last year. Even more remarkable is the fact that another        |\n|  single of theirs, Visit To Vienna, was the second most played! Add to     |\n|  that sold out tours, appearances at all the major festivals, a slew of    |\n|  awards and nominations.... and you still won't be able to comprehend      |\n|  what an utterly successful year they had at home. With a more than solid  |\n|  foundation to build on, the girls now have their mind set on conquering   |\n|  the rest of Europe as well and we are pleased to aid their quest.         |\n|                                                                            |\n|  September will see the release of What If Leaving Is A Loving Thing       |\n|  throughout mainland Europe with an exact date to be announced soon along  |\n|  with both headlining dates and support tours all over the continent.      |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b54f9f4c46c9f082cc8999723f01bd957ee6c9bf","amp;dn":"Sahara_Hotnights-Sparks-2009-pLAN9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b54f9f4c46c9f082cc8999723f01bd957ee6c9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,79,159,76,70,201,240,130,204,137,153,114,63,1,189,149,126,230,201,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
