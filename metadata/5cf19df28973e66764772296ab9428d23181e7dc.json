AT THIS ALBUM COLLABORATED EVEN GEOFF BARROW OF PORTISHEAD. If that attracts your attention...\nBe warned though: most of the songs lean towards hip-hop (some do have female vocals though, but the one who dominates is rapper Mau, who also collaborated with... Telepopmusik!), just like another forgotten Bristol band, Monk &amp; Canatella, leaned towards rock and big beat... If you can get used to it, you may appreciate the rich-in-postmodern-ironies lyrics and especially the glorious arrangements, and how every song stands out with an idea. A five-star album (almost a concept album!) that could have reached the pantheon up there with Massive Attack and Portishead, if they had more publicity.\n\nTracklisting:\n1. 1st Transmission  (6:52)\n2.
