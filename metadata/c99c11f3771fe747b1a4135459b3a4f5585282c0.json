Under the Heel of the Dragon: Islam, Racism, Crime, and the Uighur in China offers a unique insight into current conflicts resulting from the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the Chinese governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oppression of religious minorities that have heightened the degree of polarization between the Uighur and the dominant Chinese ethnic group, the Han.\n\nAuthor Blaine KaltmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s study is based on in-depth interviews that he conducted in Chinese without either the aid of an interpreter or the knowledge of the Chinese government. These riveting conversations expose the thoughts of a wide socioeconomic spectrum of Han and Uighur, revealing their mutual prejudices. The Uighurs believe that the Han discriminate against them in almost every aspect of their lives, and this perception of racism motivates the UighursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own prejudice against the Han.\n\nKaltman reports that Uighur criminal activity (unlike that of other minorities, which predominantly occurs within their own communities) is directed against their perceived oppressors, the Han Chinese. Under the Heel of the Dragon offers a unique insight into a misunderstood world and a detailed explanation of the cultural perceptions that drive these misconceptions.\n\n\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A valuable case study focusing on the degree of Uighur assimilation or desire for assimilation to the majority Han society.... engagingly written.... Highly recommended.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€CHOICE\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The truth is that there is no cut-and-dry answer to these problems, but this book has done an exceptional job foreshadowing the riots of July 2009 by examining the deep-rooted problems that XinjiangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ethnic groups face. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the same problems that many people have when forming opinions about Xinjiang, one reason this book would be a beneficial read for them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Xinjiang Far West China Blog\nAbout the Author\nBlaine Kaltman, who is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and spent five years in China, holds an MS in criminal justice from the University of Tennessee and a PhD in sociology from the University of Queensland. He traveled extensively throughout China and wrote for ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shanghai.\n\n\n\nSeries: Ohio RIS Global Series (Book 7)\nPaperback: 152 pages\nPublisher: Ohio University Press; 1 edition (August 28, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 089680254X\nISBN-13: 978-0896802544\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Under-Heel-Dragon-Racism-Uighur/dp/089680254X/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Under-Heel-Dragon-Racism-Uighur/dp/089680254X/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nTags: race, racism, han, chinese, prc, china, zhongguo, gongchen, Xinjiang, Urumqi, Uygur, Uighur,East, Turkestan, East Turkestan, Ã˜Â¯Ã›â€¡Ã™â€ Ã™Å Ã˜Â§ Ã˜Â¦Ã›â€¡Ã™Å Ã˜ÂºÃ›â€¡Ã˜Â± Ã™â€šÃ›â€¡Ã˜Â±Ã›â€¡Ã™â€žÃ˜ÂªÃ™â€°Ã™Å Ã™â€°,Dunya Uyghur Qurultiyi,Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã§Â»Â´Ã¥ï¿½Â¾Ã¥Â°â€Ã¤Â»Â£Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¤Â¼Å¡,ShÃƒÂ¬jiÃƒÂ¨ WÃƒÂ©iwÃƒÂºÃ„â€ºr DÃƒÂ ibiÃ‡Å½o DÃƒÂ huÃƒÂ¬, People, republic, china, Huo, Jintao, Ai, Wei, Wei, Xi, Jinping, Deng, Xiaoping, Asia, Asian affairs, oppression, torture, abuse, Islam, Muslim, religion, political science, International, relations, PLA, People, Liberation, Army, MSS, Ministry, State, Security, CPC, Communist, Party, China, Seperatist, insurgency, NED, National, Endowment, Democracy, Uygur, Autonomous, Region, han superiority, riot, instability, riots, lockdown, checkpoint, police, cordon, MOOTW, low, level, conflict, ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c99c11f3771fe747b1a4135459b3a4f5585282c0","amp;dn":"Under+the+Heel+of+the+Dragon_+Islam%2C+Racism%2C+Crime%2C+and+the+Uigh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c99c11f3771fe747b1a4135459b3a4f5585282c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,156,17,243,119,31,231,71,177,164,19,84,89,179,164,245,88,82,130,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
