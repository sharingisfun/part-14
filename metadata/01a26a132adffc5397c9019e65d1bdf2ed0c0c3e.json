The blend is a great one, and makes the album one of Mtume's most compelling records Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as even amidst some of the more grooving numbers, there's some great offbeat elements at work too Ã¢â‚¬â€œ almost putting the record in the territory of work by Roy Ayers or Edwin Birdsong. The mighty Hubert Eaves contributes lots of great keyboards to the record, and famous partner Reggie Lucas plays guitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while Mtume himself sings along with his percussion, and also gets some female vocal help from Tawatha. Titles include the sublime &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plus &quot;Just Funnin&quot;, &quot;Kiss This World Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Love Lock&quot;, &quot;Metal Flake Mind&quot;, and &quot;This Is Your World&quot;.
