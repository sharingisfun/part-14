A year later, he and six comrades from various countries escaped from a labor camp in Yakutsk and made their way, on foot, thousands of miles south to British India, where Rawicz reenlisted in the Polish army and fought against the Germans. The Long Walk recounts that adventure, which is surely one of the most curious treks in history. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nReview\n \n&quot;The Long Walk is a book that I absolutely could not put down and one that I will never forget...&quot;--Stephen Ambrose\n \n &quot;A poet with steel in his soul.&quot;--New York Times\n \n&quot;One of the most amazing, heroic stories of this or any other time.&quot;--Chicago Tribune\n \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA book filled with the spirit of human dignity and the courage of men seeking freedom.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Los Angeles Times\n \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeroism is not the domain of the powerful; it is the domain of people whose only other alternative is to give up and dieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.
