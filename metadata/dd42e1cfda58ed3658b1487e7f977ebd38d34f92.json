Hole intended the record to diverge significantly from their previous noise and grunge-influenced sound as featured on Pretty on the Inside (1991) and Live Through This (1994). In order to produce a cleaner, polished and more radio friendly pop rock sound, the band hired producer Michael Beinhorn to record Celebrity Skin over a nine-month period that included the band recording in California, New York and the United Kingdom.\nThe album was the band's first studio release to feature bassist Melissa Auf der Maur following the death of former bassist Kristen Pfaff in June 1994. Unlike the material on the band's previous albums, the songs on Celebrity Skin were composed by a number of musicians instead of solely frontwoman Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson. The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan contributed largely to the album's writing process and others, including Auf der Maur's former bandmate Jordon Zadorozny, contributed to its composition.\nThough credited, drummer Patty Schemel did not actually play drums on this album, and was replaced with session drummer Deen Castronovo at the suggestion of producer Beinhorn. This issue created a rift between Schemel and the band, resulting in her dropping out of the tour and parting ways with the group. Celebrity Skin was the original band's last album before their disbandment in 2002.\nCelebrity Skin was Hole's most commercially successful album. To date, it has sold over 1,400,000 copies in the United States alone, has been certified as platinum in Australia, Canada and the United States and garnered Hole a number one hit single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart with the title track, &quot;Celebrity Skin.&quot; Critical reaction to the album was largely positive and the album was listed on a number of publications' year-end lists in 1998.\n\nHole - Celebrity Skin (flac) [MentalZero][Eccles] (Size: 375.1 MB)\n \t\t00 Hole album art 01.JPG\t36.99 KB\n \t\t00 Hole album art 02.JPG\t65.44 KB\n \t\t01 Celebrity Skin.flac\t21.4 MB\n \t\t02 Awful.flac\t25.25 MB\n \t\t03 Hit So Hard.flac\t30.04 MB\n \t\t04 Malibu.flac\t30.16 MB\n \t\t05 Reasons to Be Beautiful.flac\t39.01 MB\n \t\t06 Dying.flac\t25.63 MB\n \t\t07 Use Once &amp; Destroy.flac\t39.52 MB\n \t\t08 Northern Star.flac\t32.11 MB\n \t\t09 Boys on the Radio.flac\t39.63 MB\n \t\t10 Heaven Tonight.flac\t27.51 MB\n \t\t11 Playing Your Song.flac\t26.8 MB\n \t\t12 Petals.flac\t37.93 MB\n \t\tCelebrity Skin.cue\t1.87 KB\n \t\tHole - Celebrity Skin.m3u\t679 bytes\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t2.73 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker.log\t785 bytes\n \nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 375 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Celebrity Skin \t\t\t\nTrack name/Total                         : 12\nComposer                                 : Hole\nGenre                                    : Alternative rock\nRecorded date                            : September 2, 1998\n\n\n\n===========================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 1104 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd42e1cfda58ed3658b1487e7f977ebd38d34f92","amp;dn":"Hole+-+Celebrity+Skin+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D%5BEccles%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd42e1cfda58ed3658b1487e7f977ebd38d34f92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,66,225,207,218,88,237,54,88,177,72,126,127,151,126,189,56,211,79,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
