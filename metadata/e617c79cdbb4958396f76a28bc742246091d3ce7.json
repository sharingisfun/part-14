Napolitano - Theodore and Woodrow: How Two American Presidents Destroyed Constitutional Freedom\n\nV6, Unabridged, Read by Scott Moore\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/theodore-and-woodrow-andrew-p-napolitano/1111582450?ean=9781595553515&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/theodore-and-woodrow-andrew-p-napolitano/1111582450?ean=9781595553515&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOverview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Either the Constitution means what it says, or it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founding fathers saw freedom as a part of our nature to be protectedÃ¢â‚¬â€not to be usurped by the federal governmentÃ¢â‚¬â€and so enshrined separation of powers and guarantees of freedom in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. But a little over a hundred years after AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founding, those God-given rights were laid siege by two presidents caring more about the advancement of progressive, redistributionist ideology than the principles on which America was founded.\n\nTheodore and Woodrow is Judge Andrew P. NapolitanoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shocking historical account of how a Republican and a Democratic president oversaw the greatest shift in power in American history, from a land built on the belief that authority should be left to the individuals and the states to a bloated, far-reaching federal bureaucracy, continuing to grow and consume power each day.\n\nWith lessons rooted in history, Judge Napolitano shows the intellectually arrogant, anti-personal freedom, even racist progressive philosophy driving these men to poison the American system of government.\n\nAnd Americans still pay for their legacyÃ¢â‚¬â€in the federal income, in state-prescribed compulsory education, in the Federal Reserve, in perpetual wars, and in the constant encroachment of a government that coddles special interests and discourages true competition in the marketplace.\n\nWith his attention to detail, deep constitutional knowledge, and unwavering adherence to truth telling, Judge Napolitano moves through the history of these men and their times in office to show how American values and the Constitution were sadly set aside, leaving personal freedom as a shadow of its former self, in the grip of an insidious, Nanny state, progressive ideology.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nFox News regular and former New Jersey judge Napolitano (Constitutional Chaos) seeks to prove that presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were not heroes but A-list bad guys.. Napolitano claims that Roosevelt and Wilson Ã¢â‚¬Å“pushed aside the traditionally accepted and constitutionally mandated restrictions on the federal government and used it as an instrument to redistribute wealth, regulate personal behavior, enrich the government, and enhance the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health with wars.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With the draft, instituted by Wilson in WWI, the U.S. instituted Ã¢â‚¬Å“a form of slavery and therefore tyranny.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Napolitano repeatedly links what he views as RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Progressive era folly and perfidy to the present, claiming that Wilson instituted the federal income tax we know today, which the authors calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“theftÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that, thanks to RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign meddling, the U.S. is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“most imperialistic country in the history of the world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This hit job takes on the Federal Reserve, compulsory education, industrial regulation, and race with equal lack of subtlety. Roosevelt and Wilson, according to Napolitano, were agents of central economic planning. Whatever political points Napolitano is trying to score, he doesn't accomplish\n\nNapolitano was born in Newark, New Jersey. He is a graduate of Princeton University (he was a founding member of the Concerned Alumni of Princeton[1]) and Notre Dame Law School. Napolitano sat on the New Jersey bench from 1987 to 1995, becoming the state's youngest then-sitting Superior Court judge. He also served as an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law for 11 years. Napolitano resigned his judgeship in 1995 to pursue his writing and television career. He is a member of the Libertarian party.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e617c79cdbb4958396f76a28bc742246091d3ce7","amp;dn":"Andrew+P.+Napolitano+-+Theodore+and+Woodrow+%5BV6%5D+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e617c79cdbb4958396f76a28bc742246091d3ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,23,199,156,219,180,149,131,150,247,106,40,188,116,34,70,9,29,60,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
