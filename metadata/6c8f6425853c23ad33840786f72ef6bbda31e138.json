He stalks the basements and underground passageways of New York City. He tattoos his victims' flesh with cryptic messages, using a tattoo gun loaded with poison, resulting in an agonizing, painful death.\n\nWhen a connection is made to the Bone Collector-the serial killer who terrorized New York more than a decade ago-Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs are immediately drawn into the case.\n\nRhyme, Sachs, and the NYPD must race against time to answer the many questions the investigation uncovers: Whom will the killer attack next? What is the message behind the victims' tattoos? Does the killer's own inking--a fanged centipede sporting a woman's face--hold any significance? And what is his ultimate mission?\n\nAs time runs out, Rhyme discovers that the past has returned to haunt him in the most troubling way imaginable...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c8f6425853c23ad33840786f72ef6bbda31e138","amp;dn":"Jeffery+Deaver+-+The+Skin+Collector+-+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c8f6425853c23ad33840786f72ef6bbda31e138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,143,100,37,133,60,35,173,51,132,7,134,247,46,246,187,218,49,225,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
