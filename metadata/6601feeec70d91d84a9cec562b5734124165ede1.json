So when the girls of St. SophiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s start gearing up for Sneak, their fall formal, Lily decides to join in on some good, old-fashioned party prepÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means not giving demons, vampires and the twisted magic users known as Reapers her undivided attention.\n\nBut when a Reaper infiltrates the school, Lily doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sworn to protect. She reaches deep into herself to draw out her magicÃ¢â‚¬â€and finds that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone. And it turns out sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not alone. A magical blackout has slammed through paranormal Chicago, and no one knows whatÃ¢â‚¬â€or whoÃ¢â‚¬â€caused it. But Lily knows getting back her magic is worth the risk of going behind enemy lines...\n\n\n\n\nNone of these files are my rips.  I am simply re-uping them as they didn't come up in my recent search for other Chloe Neill torrents.  I have not read any of the Dark Elite series and book 3 is the only one in my collection at the moment.\n\nMy thanks to the original uploaders.\n\nPlease seed and enjoy!  :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6601feeec70d91d84a9cec562b5734124165ede1","amp;dn":"Chloe+Neill+-+Chicagoland+Vampires+-+1-8+plus+Charmfall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6601feeec70d91d84a9cec562b5734124165ede1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,1,254,238,199,13,145,216,74,156,236,86,43,87,52,18,65,101,237,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
