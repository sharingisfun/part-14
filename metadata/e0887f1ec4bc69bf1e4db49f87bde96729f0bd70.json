Compelled by her precognitive abilities, Ia must somehow save her home galaxy long after sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone. Now Jean Johnson presents the long-awaited epic conclusion to her national bestselling military science fiction seriesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nDemoralized, their ship destroyed, IaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Damned must fight their way out of a planet-bound blockade and back into space. But there is more happening here on Dabin than meets even IaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inner eye.\n\nSome of the Feyori, energy-based beings of vast power and arrogance, are moving to block her efforts under the direction of her counter-faction foe, Miklinn. The Terran Army Division stationed on Dabin is not cooperating with her battle plans. Events are not happening as Ia has foreseen, and too many people are now in grave danger, thanks to alien Meddling.\n\nAll these hardships are threatening to derail IaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carefully laid plans. The Meddlers, however, have made one fatal mistake:\n\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just making Bloody Mary mad.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0887f1ec4bc69bf1e4db49f87bde96729f0bd70","amp;dn":"JeanJohnson-04+Hardship","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0887f1ec4bc69bf1e4db49f87bde96729f0bd70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,136,127,30,196,188,105,191,30,77,180,159,135,189,233,103,41,240,189,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
