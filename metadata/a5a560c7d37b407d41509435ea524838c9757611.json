It can be heard in George Mraz's powerful bass support on &quot;You Go to My Head,&quot; in the patented Elvin Jones 6/8 flow of a most memorable &quot;The Trip,&quot; in every bar of solo and support from Pepper's favorite pianist George Cables, and most commandingly in the leader's final solo on &quot;Cherokee&quot; (played on tenor sax, though not credited as such on the original album release), with its brilliant tag ending based on &quot;The Theme.&quot; Pepper's original &quot;For Freddie&quot; is also added as a bonus track.\n\nRecorded live at the Village Vanguard, New York, New York on July 30, 1977. Originally released on Contemporary (7644).\n\nTracklist\n1. You Go to My Head (12:00)\n2. The Trip (12:36)\n3. Cherokee (16:17)\n4. For Freddie (10:42)\n\n\nPersonnel: Art Pepper (saxophone); George Cables (piano); George Mraz (bass); Elvin Jones (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a560c7d37b407d41509435ea524838c9757611","amp;dn":"Art+Pepper+Saturday+Night+at+the+Village+Vanguard+%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Br","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a560c7d37b407d41509435ea524838c9757611","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,165,96,199,211,123,64,125,65,80,148,53,234,82,72,56,201,117,118,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
