Eric Roberts plays Becker, an aggressive marketing executive for the Coca-Cola Company; he has been assigned to figure out why sales in hot and dry Australia aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t higher. Becker comes up against a low-key but formidable adversary, T. George McDowell (Bill Kerr), whose homegrown soda has cornered the market in his little corner of the country. Complicating matters is Terri, a local woman (Greta Scacchi) Becker hires as his secretary; she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s McDowell\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s daughter and a single mom who\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s romantically attracted to the brash American. Becker wants to make a deal on his (and his employer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s) terms, but he finds himself falling prey to the charms of life Down Under and the ministrations of Terri.\nTom Wiener\n\nReview from AMG\n\nArguably Dusan Makavejev\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s most accessible and entertaining film, The Coca-Cola Kid is a genial comedy with a rare light performance by Eric Roberts, whose subsequent roles devolved largely into villains and psychotics. Makavejev plays off Roberts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; clenched line readings to suggest that here is a man who just needs a little loosening up, and he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll be okay. In fact, Roberts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; Becker is a distant cousin to Susan Anspach\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s uptight American in Makavejev\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s most popular film, Montenegro. The Coca-Cola Kid also pokes fun at the Australians, too; if Becker is wound a bit too tight, they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;re shown as making a fetish out of being laid-back. Their \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;no worries mate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; philosophy does begin to loosen up Becker, and it helps to have a sexy woman (Greta Scacchi in her second important film after a stunning debut in Heat and Dust) as the bait. The film may not be as textured and consistently entertaining as Local Hero, but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s got fizz enough.\nTom Wiener\n\nThanks to hellboytr for the up at KG\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
