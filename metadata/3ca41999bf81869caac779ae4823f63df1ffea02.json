He was born in Lisbon in 1964. He became known for his musical compositions and participation in Portuguese bands such as Madredeus and SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tima LegiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o.\n\nHe co-founded the band SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tima LegiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o in 1982 and Madredeus in 1985. As his solo career began to take shape, he chose to suspend his participation with the respective bands in 1993 and 1994.\n\nHis solo work explores a combination of modern-classic compositions with more traditional song format and instrumentation. Several artists have participated in both his records and tours, such as Lula Pena or Adriana Calcanhotto in Alma Mater and Beth Gibbons and Ryuichi Sakamoto in Cinema.\n\nHis album, Cinema, was very successful in the Portuguese market, reaching #1 in sales and its promotion concerts in Portugal and Spain were frequently sold-out. In this album, the eclectic roots of his music and the influence of cinema can be appreciated.\n\nAna Vieira is the new member of the group providing the vocals.Neil Hannon participated in the album A MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£e of Rodrigo LeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o and Cinema Ensemble..\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nAwsome pop/classical musician,there was no such option to choose in the up thingy so I chose this is....\n\n\n1 Alma Mater 4:54\n2 A Casa 5:18\n3 O Encontro 6:29\n4 Imortal 2:34\n5 O ExercÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­cio 6:32\n6 Sossego 3:48\n7 PasiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n 3:33\n8 Orionte 4:47\n9 DragÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o 4:08\n10 Vita Brevis 3:57\n11 A TragÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dia 3:36\n12 Espelhos\n\n\n\nPlease SEED!!Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ca41999bf81869caac779ae4823f63df1ffea02","amp;dn":"Rodrigo+Leao+-+Alma+Mater+%28check+description%29+%7BBlasphemy%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ca41999bf81869caac779ae4823f63df1ffea02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,164,25,153,191,129,134,156,170,199,121,174,72,35,246,61,241,255,234,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
