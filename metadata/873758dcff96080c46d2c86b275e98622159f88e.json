The audience is dull, bored and seems half-asleep. &quot;We must apologise for the slight delay, be we couldn't get into the building and we hadn't got any tickets! It's a fact. We saw a well known scalper, but we blew it ... and it was bllown!&quot; stated Plant after Sick Again. This show has some amazing playing but the crowd seems more interested in sleeping than the crushing music. This seems unbelievable, to be lucky enough to see Led Zeppelin and to react in this way. Robert slams the crowd for their reactions, but in reality, this show is great, but the next night is even greater. He's also dedicated The Song Remains The Same to the bootleggers: &quot;For the benefit of anyone who was making a bootleg then - the 12-string was out of tune!&quot; After the last encore Plant added spontaneously: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen of Long Beach ... \r\nsleep well! Half a Quaalude with water.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873758dcff96080c46d2c86b275e98622159f88e","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.11+Long+Beach%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873758dcff96080c46d2c86b275e98622159f88e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,55,88,220,255,150,8,12,70,210,200,107,39,94,152,98,33,89,248,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
