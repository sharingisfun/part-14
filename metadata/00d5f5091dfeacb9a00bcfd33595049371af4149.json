Karamouz, A. Ahmadi, M. Akhbari\n\n2011 | 676 Pages | ISBN: 1439837562 | PDF | 54 MB\n\n\n\nIncreasing demand for water, higher standards of living, depletion of resources of acceptable quality, and excessive water pollution due to urban, agricultural, and industrial expansions have caused intense environmental, social, economic, and political predicaments. More frequent and severe floods and droughts have changed the ability and resiliency of water infrastructure systems to operate and provide services to the public. These concerns and issues have also changed the way we plan and manage our surface and groundwater resources. Groundwater Hydrology: Engineering, Planning, and Management presents a compilation of the state-of-the-art subjects and techniques in the education and practice of groundwater and describes them in a systematic and integrated fashion useful for undergraduate and graduate students and practitioners","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00d5f5091dfeacb9a00bcfd33595049371af4149","amp;dn":"Groundwater+Hydrology%3A+Engineering%2C+Planning%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00d5f5091dfeacb9a00bcfd33595049371af4149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,213,245,9,29,254,172,185,160,11,207,211,53,149,4,147,113,175,65,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
