Walton and Lawson have created learning groups of similar vocalizations and clearly point out distinguishing characteristics, using phonetics, mnemonics, and other memory aids. MORE BIRDING BY EAR will increase your skill and enjoyment in the field by helping you learn the vocalizations of twenty-five species of warblers, all of the North American rails, and an assortment of terns, other waterbirds, and passerines. Many shorebird call notes are also included.\n\nCombine the auditory instruction here with the visual features of the Peterson Identification System. Page numbers in MORE BIRDING BY EAR's booklet refer to species descriptions in the PETERSON FIELD GUIDE TO BIRDS OF EASTERN AND CENTRAL NORTH AMERICA, fifth edition.\n\nRoger Tory Peterson, one of the world's greatest naturalists, received every major award for ornithology, natural science, and conservation, as well as numerous honorary degrees, medals, and citations, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The Peterson Identification System has been called the greatest invention since binoculars, and the Peterson Field Guides are credited with helping to set the stage for the environmental movement.\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nHere's a list of birds covered (copied from cassette listing) - [get ready]:\n\nTable of Contents\nCassette 1, Side A Introduction P. 5 Rails P. 9 Sora Virginia Rail Clapper Rail King Rail Yellow Rail Black Rail Waterbirds P. 15 Pied-Billed Grebe Least Bittern Common Moorhen American Coot Wood Duck Great Blue Heron Marsh Wren Empidonax Flycatchers P. 17 Least Flycatcher Acadian Flycatcher Willow Flycatcher Alder Flycatcher\n\nCassette 1, Side B Complex Vocalizations P. 19 Indigo Bunting Blue Grosbeak Pine Siskin Ruby-Crowned Kinglet Winter Wren Simple Vocalizations P. 20 Red-Breasted Nuthatch Common Nighthawk Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher Evening Grosbeak Osprey Northern Saw-Whet Owl Pairs P. 23 Black-Billed Cuckoo Yellow-Billed Cuckoo Brown Creeper Golden-Crowned Kinglet Fish Crow Common Raven SwainsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Thrush BicknellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Thrush Boat-Tailed Grackle Rusty Blackbird American Pipit Horned Lark\n\nCassette 2, Side A Warblers: Buzzy P. 29 Prairie Warbler Blue-Winged Warbler Golden-Winged Warbler Black-Throated Blue Warbler Cerulean Warbler Warblers: Simple P. 31 Prothonotary Warbler Palm Warbler Worm-Eating Warbler Cape May Warbler Bay-Breasted Warbler Blackpoll Warbler Warblers: Two-Parted P. 34 Nashville Warbler WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Warbler Chestnut-Sided Warbler Magnolia Warbler Blackburnian Warbler Mourning Warbler Yellow-Rumped Warbler\n\nCassette 2, Side B Warblers: Complex P. 38 Northern Waterthrush Louisiana Waterthrush SwainsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Warbler Yellow-Throated Warbler Tennessee Warbler Canada Warbler Yellow-Breasted Chat Sparrows P. 43 Savannah Sparrow Vesper Sparrow BachmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sparrow Henslow's Sparrow Grasshopper Sparrow Saltmarsh Sharp-Tailed Sparrow Seaside Sparrow Miscellaneous P. 47 Common LoonYellow-Bellied Sapsucker Olive-Sided Flycatcher Blue-Headed Vireo\n\nCassette 3, Side A Shorebirds: Pairs P. 49 Lesser Yellowlegs Greater Yellowlegs Short-Billed Dowitcher Long-Billed Dowitcher Shorebirds: Plovers P. 51 Black-Bellied Plover American Golden-Plover Semipalmated Plover Shorebirds: Whistlers P. 52 Spotted Sandpiper Whimbrel Upland Sandpiper Willet Shorebirds: Peepers P. 54 Least Sandpiper Semipalmated Sandpiper Sanderling Pectoral Sandpiper Shorebirds:Other P. 56 Common Snipe Terns P. 57 Royal Tern Caspian Tern Common Tern Forster's Tern Least Tern\n\nCassette 3, Side B Habitat Groupings Baxter State Park, Maine Wetlands Common Loon Rusty Blackbird Olive-Sided Flycatcher Palm Warbler WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Warbler Alder Flycatcher Second Growth And Forest Least Flycatcher Mourning Warbler Winter Wren\nTennessee Warbler Yellow-Bellied Sapsucker Blue-Headed Vireo Pine Siskin Ruby-Crowned Kinglet Evening Grosbeak Spruce And Fir Forest Brown Creeper Yellow-Rumped Warbler SwainsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Thrush Cape May Warbler Golden-Crowned Kinglet Northern Saw-Whet Owl Red-Breasted Nuthatch Bay-Breasted Warbler Blackpoll Warbler \nMt.
