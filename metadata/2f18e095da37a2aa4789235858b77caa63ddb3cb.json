Even the album tracks are pretty groovy, like the Cat Stevens-like character sketches &quot;Shoeshine Boy&quot; and &quot;The Shoemaker of Leatherwood Square,&quot; which effectively use trippy string sections and playful harmonies. The snottier folk-rock of &quot;Ask Me if I Care&quot; and the far-out &quot;Fifty Year Void,&quot; to say nothing of the nine-minute freakout &quot;Through With You,&quot; give Green Tambourine a harder edge than most bubblegum albums, though it's still closer to, say, the Cyrkle than Cream. Seek it out, bubblegum snobs: you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f18e095da37a2aa4789235858b77caa63ddb3cb","amp;dn":"The+Lemon+Pipers+-+Green+Tambourine+%281967%2F1989%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f18e095da37a2aa4789235858b77caa63ddb3cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,24,224,149,218,55,162,170,71,137,35,88,88,183,124,170,99,221,179,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
