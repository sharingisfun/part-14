Hoodoo Man Blues is so full of bravado and snap it'll make you feel tough just listening to it. Not all of the Delmark titles were recorded very well, but this one certainly was. And at 45 RPM, this now stands as the undisputed definitive version. Hoodoo Man Blues, which features Buddy Guy on guitar, is not only Junior Wells' first LP appearance, it's damn near the first LP by a Chicago blues band.\nChess and a few other labels had reissued 45s by Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, Howlin' Wolf, Jimmy Reed, Elmore James, etc., but virtually no one had tried to capture the Chicago blues sound free of the limitations of juke box/airplay promotion. Hoodoo Man Blues went a long way in the popularization of real Chicago blues and of Junior Wells.\n\nFantastic sound!!!\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. &quot;Snatch It Back and Hold It&quot; (Junior Wells) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n2. &quot;Ships on the Oceans&quot; (Wells) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n3. &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot; (Sonny Boy Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n4. &quot;Hound Dog&quot; (Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:12\n5. &quot;In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning&quot; (Bob Hilliard, David Mann) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n6. &quot;Hey Lawdy Mama&quot; (uncredited) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n7. &quot;Hoodoo Man Blues&quot; (Wells, Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:49\n8. &quot;Early in the Morning&quot; (traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n9. &quot;We're Ready&quot; (Buddy Guy, Wells) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n10. &quot;You Don't Love Me, Baby&quot; (Willie Cobbs) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n11. &quot;Chitlin Con Carne&quot; (Kenny Burrell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:12\n12. &quot;Yonders Wall&quot; (Elmore James) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Buddy Guy (originally billed as Friendly Chap) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals\n* Jack Myers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\n* Bill Warren ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n* Junior Wells ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica, vocals, performer\n\nTechnical Informations:\n\nMusic Hall MMF 5.1 Turntable\nGoldring 1042 reference Cartridge\nBelari VP-129 Tube Phono PreAmp with Sylvania 12AX7WA\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections by &quot;Goldkabel&quot;\nAudacity 1.3.5 Recording Software\nClickRepair 3.0.1 with extremly light settings (DeClick 10/DeCrackle 0) has been used to remove some clicks present due to static charge of the vinyl.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcb976947dcab5cda2562af72fb44ac8f0fe696d","amp;dn":"Junior+Wells+-+Hoodoo+Man+Blues+%5B45+rpm+Vinyl+180g%5D%5B24bit-96kHz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcb976947dcab5cda2562af72fb44ac8f0fe696d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,185,118,148,125,202,181,205,162,86,42,247,47,180,74,200,240,254,105,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
