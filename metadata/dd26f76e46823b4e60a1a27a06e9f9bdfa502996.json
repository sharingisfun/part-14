Steve and Bucky are faced with dire circumstances as a result of the Fear Itself crossover, and both have to come to terms with new threats and personal tragedy. \n\n25 American Dreamers (CA v6 01-05)\n26 The Longest Winter (FI 7.1, WS 01-05)\n27 Powerless (CA v6 06-10)\n28 Broken Arrow (WS 06-09)\n29 Shock To The System (CA v6 11-14)\n30 Black Widow Hunt (WS 10-14)\n31 New World Orders + Finale (CA v6 15-19)\n\nThere is some wonky stuff going on here for some of these issues; although theoretically all are digital copies, I think some of the sources I used mislabled the Captain America issues in some parts, as the bitsize does not match up with what it should be. However, I re-downloaded some of them from direct sources myself and having checked all the issues, they at least LOOK right and read right, so take that as you will. Also, the issues of the WInter Soldier have multiple digital editions available; I elected to use a majority of one over the other due to resolution and availability. All issues are ostensibly Digital by Zone-Empire or Minutemen-InnerDemons including the Fear Itself single, except for Captain America 17 which is from TLK-Empire. Thanks very much to them for their work; please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd26f76e46823b4e60a1a27a06e9f9bdfa502996","amp;dn":"Captain+America+by+Brubaker+%282005-2013%7C100%25%7CD%2BS%7CMM%2BE%2BDCP%7C5%2F6%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd26f76e46823b4e60a1a27a06e9f9bdfa502996","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,38,247,110,70,130,59,78,96,161,162,122,6,233,249,189,250,80,41,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
