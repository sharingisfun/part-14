With his customary wit and\nintelligence, Rich takes us through films such as Bonnie\nand Clyde, The Grapes of Wrath, Thelma and Louise,\nVanishing Point, Five Easy Pieces and even The Wizard of\nOz. He explores what makes a road movie and how the\nAmerican social, economic and political landscape has\ndefined the genre.\n\nFilmed on location in South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana,\nthe film incorporates interviews, archive footage and\nclips of some of cinemas best-loved films as it gives\nus another of Rich Hall's unique insights into American\nculture.\n\nWith his series of essays on American culture, comedian\nand QI regular Rich Hall is setting himself up as an\nimpassioned commentator on the state of his homeland.\nBut as reasoned as his arguments may be, he also enjoys\nnothing more than a good olÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ comic rant. So for this\ntreatise on the romance of the road movie he takes apart\nthe beat poets, delivers a hilarious diatribe against\nJeremy Clarkson, and rounds it all off with a sublime\nStar Wars as highway-diner cheesecake metaphor.\n\nThe spacious vistas so beloved of road-movie directors\ngive the film a sumptuous, widescreen feel.\n\nThe comedian presents a history of the American road movie.\nHe travels through South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana to\nexplore how the country's culture has both shaped and\nbeen shaped by the genre, and analyses films including\nBonnie and Clyde, The Grapes of Wrath, Thelma &amp; Louise,\nVanishing Point, Five Easy Pieces and The Wizard of Oz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85aae1fe85552473e9a62a0f6f08557f96d2379a","amp;dn":"BBC+Rich+Hall%5C%27s+Continental+Drifters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85aae1fe85552473e9a62a0f6f08557f96d2379a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,170,225,254,133,85,36,115,233,166,42,15,111,8,85,127,150,210,55,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
