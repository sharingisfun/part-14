Taken from four different sessions, he is heard with a quartet, a sextet and two different quintets (including one with the fine tenor-saxophonist Bobby Jaspar). Each of these sets are essential for true Chet Baker fans.\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Chet 3:15\n2 Dinah 3:09\n3 In Memory Of Dick 2:58\n4 Alone Together (1) 3:32\n5 Alone Together (2) 3:42\n6 Exitus (Quartet Version) 7:03\n7 All The Things You Are 5:41\n8 Chekeetah 5:06\n9 How About You 4:14\n10 Exitus - Quintet Version I 4:28\n11 Exitus - Quintet Version II 4:24\n12 Anticipated Blues 2:17\n13 Tasty Pudding - Take 1 2:18\n14 Tasty Pudding - Take 2 1:56\n15 Tasty Pudding - Take 3 2:09\n16 Tasty Pudding - Take 4 6:05\n\nCredits\n\nAlto Saxophone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jean Aldegon (tracks: 1 to 3)\nBass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Benoit Quersin (tracks: 4 to 11), Eddie De Haas (tracks: 12 to 16), James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Bond* (tracks: 1 to 3)\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Charles Saudrais (tracks: 12 to 16), Jean-Louis Viale (tracks: 4 to 11), Nils-Bertil Dahlander (tracks: 1 to 3)\nPiano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Francy Boland (tracks: 12 to 16), Raymond Fol (tracks: 4 to 7), RenÃƒÂ© Urtreger (tracks: 1 to 3, 8 to 11)\nTenor Saxophone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bobby Jaspar (tracks: 8 to 11), Jean-Louis Chautemps (tracks: 12 to 16) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e36284a136ac9bfd853a51f4b1403e1258da6864","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+Chet+in+Paris+vol.+4+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e36284a136ac9bfd853a51f4b1403e1258da6864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,98,132,161,54,172,155,253,133,58,81,244,177,64,62,18,88,218,104,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
