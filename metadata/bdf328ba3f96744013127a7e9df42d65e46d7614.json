Even though it was an experimental concept album -- toying with unusual time signatures -- it's a comfortable, comforting record, best remembered for the hit song &quot;Take Five,&quot; but also packed with other melodic delights such as &quot;Three To Get Ready&quot; and &quot;Blue Rondo A La Turk,&quot; all of which show the brilliant interplay of Brubeck and saxophonist-composer Paul Desmond, bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello.  ~ Joe Sixpack\n\nDave Brubeck Quartet - Time Out (50th Anniversary) CD 2 of 2\n01 St.  Louis Blues \n02 Waltz Limp \n03 Since Love Had Its Way \n04 Koto Song \n05 Pennies from Heaven \n06 You Go to My Head \n07 Blue Rondo a La Turk \n08 Take Five","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf328ba3f96744013127a7e9df42d65e46d7614","amp;dn":"Dave+Brubeck+Quartet+-+Time+Out+%2850th+Anniversary%29+CD+2+of+2+%2819","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf328ba3f96744013127a7e9df42d65e46d7614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,243,40,186,63,150,116,64,19,18,122,126,157,244,45,101,228,109,118,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
