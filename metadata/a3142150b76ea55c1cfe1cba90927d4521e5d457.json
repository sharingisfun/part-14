But there is one place that her family left out of their stories: the supposedly haunted Stone Hollow, a hidden valley with an old, deserted cottage. And though Amy is curious, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a straight answer about it from anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€well, anyone except Jason.\n\nJason has explored Stone Hollow, and he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s haunted. He has a different theory: He believes itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a place where time folds and moves over itself, replaying scenes and moments from the past. And sometimes, the past comes back in unexpected and unwanted ways. Amy doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe Jason at first, but soon she realizes that things arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always as they seem. Could Jason be right about the secret of Stone Hollow ?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3142150b76ea55c1cfe1cba90927d4521e5d457","amp;dn":"The+Ghosts+of+Stone+Hollow+-+Zilpha+Keatley+Snyder.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3142150b76ea55c1cfe1cba90927d4521e5d457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,20,33,80,183,110,165,92,28,254,28,186,144,146,125,69,33,229,212,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
