'How many squiggles can a city take?' he once asked. He has been described as classical, minimalist, simple, but if there is a word he would like to apply to his architecture, it is 'humane'.\r\nAlan Yentob talks to Chipperfield about his breakthrough in Berlin, his love of the city and its history and the 11 years spent on the transformation of the Neues Museum, his 'masterpiece'. After successes at the Hepworth Gallery, Wakefield, and Turner Contemporary Margate, he is now embarking on his most prestigious project ever, a new gallery for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/76/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2e/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/72/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a2/David-Chipperfield-A-Place-to-be-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~2240Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 44.1KHz (~124Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 66 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.09 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06r97c4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9474f792fa90f8f23591ddf1e7f5f0328f34c1d3","amp;dn":"BBC+Imagine+2015+David+Chipperfield+A+Place+to+Be+720p+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9474f792fa90f8f23591ddf1e7f5f0328f34c1d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,116,247,146,250,144,248,242,53,145,221,241,231,245,240,50,143,52,193,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
