She is a feminist doing things many feminists would consider beastly, and loving every second of it. In Diary of an S&amp;M Romance, Dollie Llama explores the complex connections between romantic sweetness and furious, nasty sex.\n\nPart introspective journey of discovery, part tender love story.\nPart manifesto of empowerment, part dirty dirty book.\n\nShe met her owner on Bondage.com, and now they just can&amp;#039;t stop touching each other in special places, and in special ways.\n\nTheir relationship is one of mutual respect, intellectual stimulation, and filthy brutal lovemaking.\n\nDollie is her owner&amp;#039;s submissive, yielding to his every wish, no matter how depraved. In the bedroom and out, she exists only to serve him. She&amp;#039;s Daddy&amp;#039;s dress-up dolly use-me girl.\nAnd she loves it.\n\nThey have a love built on equality, tenderness and romance. Even with all the whips, toys, collars, leashes, lingerie, perfume &amp; pumps (and occasional evenings with a second &quot;slave girl&quot;), their connection is a lot healthier than many more &quot;vanilla&quot; affairs.\n\nHere is the first installment of the true story of their startling love, told in letters, e-mails, conversations, essays and photographs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c282135b2cabd7b83fd1a27d5dd942ed8534e247","amp;dn":"Diary+of+an+S%26M+Romance+-second+printing+eBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c282135b2cabd7b83fd1a27d5dd942ed8534e247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,130,19,91,44,171,215,184,63,209,162,125,93,217,66,237,133,52,226,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
