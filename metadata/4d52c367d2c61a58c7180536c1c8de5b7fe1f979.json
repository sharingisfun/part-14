The second Portable (USB) Live edition...\n\nNote: it is slow running on older PC's running from an USB stick..Main reason is the limitation in speed on a USB stick..(Just a power over USB portable harddrive is a lot faster.., but not so fucking portable as a stick!!)\nit's meant to repair and rescue your current OS, or clone it to your harddrive or other destination....If it won't boot, try to install Chameleon bootloader on destination.. otherwise.. It's bad luck.. your PC isn't supported.. (you always can try to hack the BIOS firmware of your motherboard.......die hards only !!)\n\nyou can find HELP on:\n\n# kalyway.DVD irc.osx86.hu\n# leopard irc.osx86.hu\n# www.muzzle.nl (Dutch Hackintosh community)\n# OSx86 Hackintosh forums spread over the whole wide .net...\n# When your network card driver is installed, try Firefox... there are interesting OSx86 links...\n\nRead carefully !!!\n\nAMD not supported, INTEL only [SSE2/SSE3] or higher.. (for AMD you always can try patch it after cloning..)\n\nEnglish only !! All languages and other platform system architectures are removed !! except dutch option is left in..(je zult alsnog Nederlands apart moeten installeren als gij dat wenst..)\nYou can always re-install this languages etc. very easy afterwards..\n\nTO INSTALL:\n\nDrivegenius 2 is fastest way to clone with unmounting both drives..mount USB image, choose that as source disk... and make your USB stick the destination disk !! If it won't boot..install Chameleon Bootloader on your (USB) destination disk !!\n\nYou can use CarbonCopyCloner 3, DriveGenius 2, or other cloner.. Select this included diskimage as source disk, or mount it first...then select mounted partition/Try to force a clone on block-level !! [try to force a clone on a location where you can unmount both source and destination (the only easy and proper way to do this is with 2 physcally USB and/or harddrives already installed..) But is also possible to have succes without unmouting the drives (source and destination) Always try\nto unmount destination disk first.....\n\nClonetools H1. With Clonetools H1 choose Hackingtosh architecture, and clone it to your desired location !\n\nAlways Repair your Permissions after cloning..\n\nIf it won't boot after cloning.. Install Chameleon bootloader on the destination disk, it should be bootable from a USB stick.....or your PC isn't supported..\n\nLogin:\n\nUser = protocolxleohacked\nPassword = x\n\n\niTunes, iChat, Mail, iPhoto, DVD Player etc.. are removed..\nAll videodrivers are removed.. to prevent problems on some systems !! Except some Intel videodrivers are left in..\n\nSpotlight is disabled, you can turn it on with cache Cleaner..\n\nInstall your own OSx86 videodriver after cloning..in Downloads folder you can find Graphics Update 10.5.4-10.5.5 after installation, OSx86 tools will help.......\nAfter succes you can enable QuartzExtreme 2D for even more video acceleration with Quartzsimple in OSX Utilities folder..OpenGL with OSx86 tools.. With video-hardware acceleration Leopard should be running like hell..(NOW IN 10.5.4 UPDATE in Downloads folder there is a 10.5.5 Graphics update, install it and choose your string or injector)\n\nDon't try to install OS system updates, unless you know exactly what you're doing !!\n\n\nbased on Universal x86 DVD 10.5.2 and INTEL 10.5.3 update version of Kalyway..\n\nbased on slipstream script by DENSE ! ;)\n\nich9 support by DUNE ! ;)\n\nupdated with iATKOS 10.5.4 Intel system\n\nRebuild, tweaked and updated by ProtocolX ! :)\n\n\nNotes: If you have problems with booting your (USB) Drive after cloning, install Chameleon bootloader on the destination disk.\n\nTo get a higher resolution without a videodriver hit F8 at Darwin's promt and type: &quot;Graphics Mode&quot;=&quot;1280x1024x32&quot;\n\n\nif you have problems with installing your videodriver on reboot with video gfx (blue or black screen)\n\nAll you have to do is just press F8 at Darwin's prompt and then type -x, (safe mode) and/or -s (single user mode) then\n\nat root type mount -uw /\n\nand /movevideodrivers\n\nthen it will be prompt to move video drivers by class ( nvidia ; ati ; or intel gma) voila!\n\ntype yes to confirm or enter to skip !\n\nAfter trying updating your system, type: update -v at Darwin's prompt..\n\n\nmore options for Darwin's promt:\n\n* -f This forces rebuilding of extensions cache\n* -s Boots into a single user command line mode\n* -v Verbose, boots in text mode showing all debug info and errors\n* -x Boots into safe mode\n* -F Ignore configurationfile\n* rd=disk0s1 - Tells Darwin to boot from a certain partition specified in BSD format.\n(Disk 0 specifies first HDD and s1 specifies first partition as 0 is the MBR.)\n* cpus=1 Tells the system how many CPUs or cores to use, useful for Core Duo users.\n* platform=X86PC - Can be used if problems with normal booting, ACPI is another option here\n* -legacy Boots OS X in 32bit mode rather than 64bit if 64bit is used due to a 64bit processor\n* idehalt=0 May stop stuttering\n* &quot;Graphics Mode&quot;=&quot;WIDTHxHEIGHTxDEPTH&quot; (e.g. &quot;1024x768x32&quot;)\nFor VESA 3.0 graphics, you may append a refresh rate\nafter an &quot;@&quot; character (e.g. &quot;1280x1024x32@75&quot;)\n* kernel: kernel name (e.g. &quot;mach_kernel&quot; - must be in &quot;/&quot; )\n\nIf you need to copy the bootloader to the MBR use this command:\n\nfdisk -u /dev/rdisk0\n\n\nAll the permanent settings are stored under /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist and a good way to edit this is using nano in the command line. Another way is to drag it to the desktop, edit with TextEdit and then overwrite the original but this usually saves time with ownership issues.\nJust copy and delete orginal from location, and edit on desktop with textedit...\nBut for instance to open it in the terminal I would go:\n\nsudo -s\n\nnano /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist\n\nYou will then see something similar to this:\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel\nmach_kernel\nKernel Flags\n\nBoot Graphics\nYes\nTimeout\n10\nQuiet Boot\nNo\n\n\n\nLet's look at what each of these do.\n\n* Kernel - this tells the bootloader which kernel to boot with.\n* Boot Graphics - this tells it whether to show the pretty Apple loading screen or not\n* Timeout - this is the time before the default boot option is chosen\n* Quiet Boot - if set to yes the OS boots straight to the GUI without showing the bootloader, if set to no it boots to the bootloader first.\nTo use the chain0 boot method this MUST be set to 'No'. To access the bootloader when this is set to 'Yes' bash F8 repeatedly during boot till it displays.\n\nYou can set more than mentioned above but those are the standard ones and any of the following can be added using keys such as &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; to the config file. All commands in darwinbootloader you can put in plist file.....\n\nAn example of a configuration to boot OS X in safe mode, verbosely, with 1024x768 resolution forced and with the 2nd partition as default is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel\nmach_kernel\nKernel Flags\n-v\n-x\nrd=disk0s2\nGraphics Mode\n1024x768x32\nBoot Graphics\nNo\nTimeout\n10\nQuiet Boot\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nSave your plist file on desktop, with extension .plist, delete orginal, place your own, Repair Permissions with Disk Utillity, Reboot...\n\n\nEven if you have chosen a kernel.. you can still try the others kernels for testing ! (same thing for Kalyway dvd boot except that only modbinkernel , speedstepkernel , kabylkernel and nforcekernel are available as boot options !)\n\n\nAll you have to do is just press F8 at Darwin's prompt and then type the kernel's name you want to boot with :\n\nsleepkernel (intel/amd/sse2/sse3)\nspeedstepkernel (intel/amd/sse2/sse3)\nnforcekernel (intel/sse3)\nmodbinkernel (intel/amd/sse3)\nvanillakernel (intel/sse3)\nkabylkernel (intel/sse3) with sleep support\n\n\nKernels:\n\nkernel_9.2_sleep\nkernel_9.2_speedstep\nkernel_9.2.2_kabyl\nkernel_92_nforce\nkernel_vanilla_922\nkernel_9.3_modbin\nkernel_9.4_modin\nkernel_9.4_StageXNU\n\ndefault boot is modbin 9.4 kernel.. -v at Darwin's prompt will boot modbin's 9.2 kernel..\n\nThanX to Kalyway for this..\n\n\nIncluded 3rd party Applications:\n\nAppZapper [software de-installer]\nAudio Tool Player [all audio tool]\nClonetools_H1 [cloner]\nCarbonCopyCloner 3 [cloner]\nDrive Genius 2.1 [All Disk Management]\nDiscEraser [erases CD-DVD/RW]\nCrossover Pro 7 [runs a lot of Windows software without emulation !!]\nCocoThumbX (very easy icon maker)\nYummyFTP [FTP client]\nStainless [fast simple multiprocessor browser]\nMinefield [Mozilla Firefox Intel Optimized]\nFast icons [very good icontool]\nFolderLister [drag folder to list content]\nGrandPerspective [drive mapper]\nHardwareGrowler\nIceClean [systemtool]\nFlip4Mac WMF plugin for Quicktime]\nKCNScrew [software info 1 december 2008]\nLeopard Cache Cleaner [systemtool]\nMagic Number Machine\nHimmelbar [App launcher]\nFasticns [icon maker]\niDefrag [not only very good defrag, \u0010but can also repair B-Tree files !!!]\niSSH [remote login]\nLittle Snitcher [Very fine small, light Firewall, to prevent outgoing commu.]\nOnyX [system tweaktool]\nQuickTime Player Pro\nSimply Burns\nSimplyRAR [RAR compressor]\nTelling Folders [Gives folder a icon]\nTinkerTool [tweak system]\nMac Telnet [advanced telnet client]\nNetrestore [remotely clone or restore a disk or image]\nTransmission [fine torrentclient]\nUnRARx 2.2 [RAR extractor]\nVerbalize [Mac Talks, only Alex's voice is left out.. because of it's big size..]\nXupport 3 [tweak hidden OSX settings]\nVLC Player [mediaplayer]\nxMod [OSX mod]\nXbench [benchmark]\n\n\nOSx86 Tools:\n\nEFIStudio\nExtensions-Repair\nHexEditors\nKext Helper b7\nDPCI Manager\nEFiX Updater\nKextpermissions.command\nKeyViewer\nOSX86 Tools\nPacifist\nPackageMaker\nPreferential Treatment\nProperty List Editor 2.2\nPlist Editor Pro\nRepair &amp; Set Permissions 1.0\nUSB Prober\nNVCAP Maker\ngfxutil\nNTFS - 3G [NTFS writer, to remove look in Downloads folder]\nand more.....\n\nCreated with folderLister\n\n\n\nNote: X11 is installed.. this is needed in many cases to run Windows or Linux Software.. or other platform related tasks..\nBut it crashes on my USB stick, I tried to repair this, with no succes.. But I found out.. After cloning (not on a USB stick)\nYou can repair your Permissions of your cloned disk, and then it should work.. Possible reason for the X11 crash\nis the USB stick, but also X11 itself, this User edition wasn't very stable after all..\n(full install on the 7.5GB orginal Apple Leopard Disc can help, search for developertools)\n\nBIG THX to Kalyway, Chameleon team, Maxxuss, Dune , Dense , modbin, jas , Joe75 , etorix , netkas , rp4k , tehmachacker ,zef , kabyl , magicone , jacquesdupontd , lastexile , chiva4ry , Uphuck, rofl , unisex ,asap18 ,iAtkos, ProtocolX, xyz ,XxX yourself and all the others !

Do yourself a favour and support them as we do !!!\n\n\nThis live iPortable stick should only be used to preview Mac OS X Leopard. If you really like Mac OS X Leopard and you want to use it............\n\nyou maybe should get a real Mac.
