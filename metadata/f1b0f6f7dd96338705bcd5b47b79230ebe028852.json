They may have been able to walk on two feet and create tools 4 million years ago, but they couldn't remember or communicate. Fortunately, people got smarter, and things got better. They remembered on-the-spot solutions and shared the valuable information of their experiences. Clubs became swords, caves became huts, and fires became ovens. Collectively these new tools became technology. As the 21st century unfolds, the pace of innovation is accelerating exponentially. Breakthroughs from robotics to genetics appear almost on a daily basis. It's all happening so quickly that it's hard to keep trackÃ¢â‚¬â€but recently there's been a shift. We used to create technology to change the world around us; now we're using it to change ourselves. With vaccinations, in-vitro fertilization, and individual genetic therapy, we're entering a new epoch, a next step, faster and more dramatic than the shift from Australopithicines to Homo Sapiens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1b0f6f7dd96338705bcd5b47b79230ebe028852","amp;dn":"Humans+3.0%3A+The+Upgrading+of+the+Species","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1b0f6f7dd96338705bcd5b47b79230ebe028852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,176,246,247,221,150,51,135,5,188,213,180,123,121,35,14,190,2,136,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
