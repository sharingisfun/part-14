Originally called De Principatibus (About Principalities), it was originally written in 1513,[1] but not published until 1532, five years after MachiavelliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death. The treatise is not representative of the work published during his lifetime, but it is the most remembered, and the work responsible for bringing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMachiavellianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ into wide usage as a pejorative term. It has also been suggested by some critics that the piece is, in fact, a satire.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://opencast.de/?p=429&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://opencast.de/?p=429&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWant more free Ebooks and Audiobooks ? just visit http://www.opencast.de\n\n\n\n(http seed by www.opencast.de)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97888dbbb56598e8bd27673973a88f5b18b7521c","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+Il+Principe+%28The+Prince%29+by+Niccol%C3%83%C2%B2+Machiavelli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97888dbbb56598e8bd27673973a88f5b18b7521c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,136,141,187,181,101,152,232,189,39,103,57,115,168,143,91,24,183,82,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
