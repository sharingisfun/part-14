Please enjoy\n\n\n\nThe ever after, the demonic realm that parallels the human world, is shrinking. If it disappears completely, so does all magic. It's up to witch-turned-daywalking-demon Rachel Morgan to avert catastrophe and keep life from changing... for the worse.\n\nWhile saving the world is important, it isn't Rachel's only motivation. There's also the small fact that she caused the ley line to rip in the first place, setting off a chain reaction of unfortunate events. That little mistake has made her life forfeit unless she can fix it. It's also made her more than a few enemies, including the most powerful demon in the ever afterÃ¢â‚¬â€a terrifying entity who eats souls and now has an insatiable appetite for her. He's already kidnapped her friend and goddaughter to lure her out, and if Rachel doesn't give herself up soon, they'll die.\n\nBut Rachel has more than a few impressive and frightening skills of her own, and she isn't going to hand over her soul and her life without one hell of a fight. She's also got a surprise: elven tycoon Trent Kalamack. With this unlikely ally beside herÃ¢â‚¬â€a prospect both thrilling and unnervingÃ¢â‚¬â€she's going to return to the ever after, kick some demon butt, rescue her loved ones... and prevent an apocalypse before it's too late. Or, at least that's the plan...(less) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:912752ca35108a245aad548095d69b16a4c048f8","amp;dn":"%28Blaik%29Ever+After+%28The+Hollows%2C+Audio+Book11%29+by+Kim+Harrison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"912752ca35108a245aad548095d69b16a4c048f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,39,82,202,53,16,138,36,90,173,84,128,149,214,155,22,164,192,72,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
