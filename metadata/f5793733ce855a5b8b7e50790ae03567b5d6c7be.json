Beautiful ballads like the funk-inflected &quot;Goodbye My Love&quot; and &quot;I Guess I'll Have To Cry, Cry, Cry&quot; (given a dramatic, string-laden rendering here) feature Brown's trademark banshee-in-heat wail. All of the aforementioned songs charted on both the R&amp;B and pop charts, as did the super-groovy &quot;Licking Stick&quot;--a song to which it is literally impossible to sit still. Like almost all of Brown's material from this period, SAY IT LOUD is classic, fantastic, and indispensable. (cduniverse)\n\n\n\nA bomb! The title of this one says it all -- a burning anthem of pride and power, issued in 1969, at the end of one of the most troubling decades in America. \nJames answers all the Uncle Tom cries from his critics -- and comes up with &quot;Say It Loud&quot;, an instant chant that was taken up around the world, and which still packs a pretty hard punch today! \nThe album's filled with other excellent cuts -- like the tasty funk number &quot;Lickin' Stick&quot;, with some rocket-driven guitar, and the great instrumental &quot;Shades of Brown&quot;.
