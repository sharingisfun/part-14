It is a sequel of sorts to their earlier compilation Complete Madness (meaning the completed title is interpreted by some fans as &quot;Complete and Utter Madness&quot;) and comprises songs from the latter half of their career. The new single &quot;(Waiting For) The Ghost Train,&quot; which would become the band's final single of the 1980s, is featured here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9510ed5c0b41103ddfb2c0e85e77d04d54d043e","amp;dn":"Madness-Utter+Madness+1986+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9510ed5c0b41103ddfb2c0e85e77d04d54d043e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,81,14,213,192,180,17,3,221,251,44,14,133,231,125,4,213,77,4,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
