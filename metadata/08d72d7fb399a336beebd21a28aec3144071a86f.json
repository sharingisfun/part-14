The title song is a vocal duet between Domingo and its composer John Denver. \r\nIt was released as a single, peaking at #22 on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and #59 on the Hot 100 chart. \r\nNever going out of print, the song sold almost four million copies by 2008. \r\nThe album was released on CD in 1990 and again in 2008.\r\nThe album's producer, Milton Okun , encouraged Domingo, a famous Spanish opera singer, to try his hand at recording popular English-language songs. \r\nDomingo later recalled, &quot;Milton is the first person who believed I could do that kind of music.&quot; \r\nThe producer also suggested the idea that the tenor collaborate with folksinger John Denver on the album's most successful number, &quot; Perhaps Love.&quot;  \r\nDomingo and Okun went on to make several more recordings together, but Perhaps Love remained the tenor's best-selling album of pop music .\r\nDomingo credited the success of the album with increasing his fanbase, including drawing more new people to his opera performances. \r\nHe said in 2008: &quot;As an opera singer, you never think of the Billboard list. Without any doubt, it really helped my following records.&quot; \r\nThe album's conductor, Lee Holdridge , considered Domingo and Denver's collaboration on &quot;Perhaps Love&quot; to be the start of the modern operatic pop phenomenon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d72d7fb399a336beebd21a28aec3144071a86f","amp;dn":"Placido+Domingo+-+Perhaps+Love+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d72d7fb399a336beebd21a28aec3144071a86f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,215,45,127,179,153,163,54,190,235,210,26,40,174,195,20,64,113,168,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
