One of the few unaffected humans is Frank Castle and it's his job to kill all of the infected humans and superheroes and villains. Frank Castle is immune to the virus due to how the toxin was released, partly his fault, so he needs to atone for releasing the toxin by killing everyone that's infected and saving the last few remaining unaffected humans.\n\nThis series was followed by the prequel Marvel Universe vs. Wolverine exploring the source of the infection and the third volume taking place between the two entitled Marvel Universe vs. The Avengers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34fbcf54c035fc3b4de165156904b2f6f0d74c28","amp;dn":"Marvel+Universe+Vs.+The+Punisher+%2801+-+04%29+%282010%29+%28Digital%29+%28Zon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34fbcf54c035fc3b4de165156904b2f6f0d74c28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,251,207,84,192,53,252,59,77,225,101,21,105,4,178,246,240,215,76,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
