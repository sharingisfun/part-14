Hard Time Killin' Floor\n\nWhile at Cambridge, MA, Maria Muldaur joined the Jim Kweskin Jug Band and began an affair with singer Geoff Muldaur; the couple eventually married and had a daughter, Jenni, who would later become a singer in her own right. When the Kweskin band broke up in 1968, the couple stayed with their label (Reprise) and began recording together as Geoff &amp; Maria Muldaur. They moved to Woodstock, NY, to take advantage of the burgeoning music scene there and issued two albums -- 1970's Pottery Pie and 1971's Sweet Potatoes -- before Geoff departed in 1972 to form Better Days with Paul Butterfield, a move that signaled not only the end of the couple's musical partnership, but their marriage as well.\n\nGeoff Muldaur Vocals, Piano, Guitar, Luzan, Organ, Horns\nMaria Muldaur Vocals, Tambourine\nAmos Garrett Electric Guitar, Trombone, Vocal on track 3\nBill Keith Pedal Steel\nBilly Mundi Drums, Luzan, Percussions\nJohn Kahn Bass\nGUESTS\nPaul Butterfield Harmonica\nJeff Gutcheon Piano\nBobby Notkoff Violin\nTrevor Lawrence Bariton Sax\nPeter Ecklund Trumpet\nGene Dinwiddie Tenor Sax\nMunc Blackburn Alto Sax\nJunior Turlock Bass\nStu Brotman Bowed Bass, Bass Trombone\nBilly Wolf Bass on track 10\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19aa8a9f15ca26fd280765f2a3e9a45ad3a27b4a","amp;dn":"%28Blues%3BFolk%3BRoots%29+Geoff+%26+Maria+Muldaur+-+Sweet+Potatoes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19aa8a9f15ca26fd280765f2a3e9a45ad3a27b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,170,138,159,21,202,38,253,40,7,101,242,163,233,164,90,211,162,123,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
