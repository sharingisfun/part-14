They showed that celestial objects are composed of the same materials as the earth and that they behave in the same way. They displaced successively the earth, the sun and finally the milky way galaxy from being the centre of the universe.\nThis book contains their biographies and outlines their greatest discoveries. Hard work, physical insight, desire for fame and a strong belief in the rightness of their own ideas were characteristics of all eight. Their often quirky personalities led them into bitter controversies with their contemporaries. But their successes arose from the outstanding clarity of their thoughts, their practical ability and their strong sense of direction in science.\n\nCONTENTS\n1 Introduction: Talent and opportunity 1\n2 Galileo: Seeing and believing 8\n3 Isaac Newton: Rationalising the universe 40\n4 William Herschel: Surveying the heavens 76\n5 William Huggins: Celestial chemical analysis 117\n6 George Ellery Hale: Providing the tools 156\n7 Arthur Eddington: Inside the stars 198\n8 Harlow Shapley: Defining our galaxy 235\n9 Edwin Hubble: Journeying to the edge 268\nIndex 302","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:825074ee30710a752fae6cac69e610bd13172d87","amp;dn":"Revolutionaries+of+the+Cosmos+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"825074ee30710a752fae6cac69e610bd13172d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,80,116,238,48,113,10,117,47,174,108,172,105,230,16,189,19,23,45,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
