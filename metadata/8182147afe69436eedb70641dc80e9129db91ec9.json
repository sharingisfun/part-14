They were formed in Woking, Surrey. While they shared the &quot;angry young men&quot; \noutlook and fast tempos of their punk rock contemporaries, The Jam wore smartly tailored \nsuits rather than ripped clothes, and they incorporated a number of mainstream 1960s rock \ninfluences rather than rejecting them, placing The Jam at the forefront of the mod revival \nmovement.\n\nThey had 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to \ntheir break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, &quot;That's Entertainment&quot; \nand &quot;Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?&quot; remained the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK. \nThey released one live album and six studio albums, the last of which, The Gift, hit number one on \nthe UK album charts. When the group split up, their first 15 singles were re-released and all \nplaced within the top 100.\n\nThe band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including \n1960s beat music, soul, rhythm and blues and psychedelic rock, as well as 1970s punk and new wave. \nThe trio was known for its melodic pop songs, its distinctly English flavour and its mod image. \nThe band launched the career of Paul Weller, who went on to form The Style Council and later \nhad a successful solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of The JamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original compositions, \nand he played lead guitar, using a Rickenbacker. Bruce Foxton provided backing vocals and prominent \nbasslines, which were the foundation of many of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs, including the hits \n&quot;Down in the Tube Station at Midnight&quot; &quot;The Eton Rifles&quot; &quot;Going Underground&quot; and &quot;Town Called Malice&quot;\n\n\n   1.
