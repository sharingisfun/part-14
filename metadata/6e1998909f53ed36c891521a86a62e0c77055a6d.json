Paco's ability to carry a song with just his guitar and the most subtle of backing musicians is quite awe-inspiring. He moves from complex delicate guitar rhythmic arrangements, to furiously intense rapid fire passages that will almost certainly invoke an response of complete awe &amp; admiration for what he does better than anyone else. This is an Anthology of (a Limited 2 Cd version) that complies his two 'Antologia' albums into 2 disks (1 disk for each Anthology), and for a double album that weights in at over 24 tracks, you'd think that you'd have had your fill of Contemporary Flamenco, way before then....but you'd be wrong, spreading the listening experience a disk at a time (over 2 days) not only left me with an unquenchable thirst for more of his work, but has that astute honour of being the most remarkable album, I've heard for sometime, and that's with some truly exceptional competition, utter genius. And it should also be noted that this is a perfect introduction into Paco's sublime music if your new to this particular artist.\n-- amazon user review\n\nTracks\nCD 1\n01- Almoraima\n02- Cancion de Amor\n03- Gloria al Nino Ricardo\n04- Solo Quiero Caminar\n05- Punta Umbria\n06- Rio Ancho\n07- Danza Ritual del Fuego\n08- Compadres\n09- Fuente y Caudal\n10- Casilda\n11- Cepa Andaluza\n12- Rumba Improvisada\n\nCD 2\n01- Zyryab\n02- Guajiras de Lucia\n03- Cobre\n04- Monasterio de Sal\n05- Cana de Azucar\n06- Barrio la Vina\n07- Tio Sabas\n08- La Barrosa\n09- La Cueva del Gato\n10- Chiquito\n11- En la Caleta\n12- Entre dos Aguas\n13- Aranjuez\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e1998909f53ed36c891521a86a62e0c77055a6d","amp;dn":"Paco+de+Lucia+-+Antologia+%5BFLAC%5D+FSM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e1998909f53ed36c891521a86a62e0c77055a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,25,152,144,159,83,237,54,200,145,82,26,134,166,46,12,119,5,90,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
