It began in 2000 as a black metal solo project by Neige, soon a trio, but following the release of their first demo in 2001, band members Aegnor and Argoth left the band, leaving Neige as the sole member.\nThis marked a change in style, as Alcest's subsequent releases have more often been described as shoegazing mixing numerous rock and metal influences, including black metal and post-metal. In 2009 the ex-Peste Noire's drummer Winterhalter (now in Les Discrets) joined Alcest's studio line-up, after eight years with Neige as the sole full time member. Since its creation, Alcest has released three studio albums.\n\n\nimage Review:\nBecause we are talking about a shoegaze/black metal hybrid here and this record is absolutely gorgeous, I could pontificate ad-nauseum with wistful metaphors to describe the borderline transcendent power of this music. I could proclaim loudly how Ã¢â‚¬Å“Le SecretÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“ElevationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ have these slow building epic soundscapes that remind you of strolling through a tranquil forest in autumn astride a mighty unicorn or some ridiculously corny sh*t like that. I could regale you all with sweeping prose about the majestic power and beauty on display here, how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like wondering into some Goddamn cave with dripping water made even more awesome by piercing sunlight or some overpoweringly pretentious sh*t of the like.\nInstead letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just get straight to the damn point, because I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really know that much about blast beats and tremolo picking and am not going to waste anybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time trying to describe the black metal influences vs shogaze in any kind of focused, linear way. This EP has 4 tracks and two songs, with two versions of each, an original from 2006 and a re-recorded version from this year. The re-recorded ones are infinitely better in their production and are thus vastly superior overall, although the originals are strong in their own right, maybe even better if you enjoy sh*ttier production. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Le SecretÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is mostly a shoegaze track with angelic vocals and a driving sense of melody, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a damn good song. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ElevationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is probably one of the greatest songs IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever heard. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about 14 minutes long, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s astoundingly gorgeous. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell you if this is better than their last full-length although Ã¢â‚¬Å“ElevationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is absolutely better than anything on that album. Even if you hate black metal, shoegaze, the French, or think youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re too manly to listen to something that makes you want to careen through a glistening dewy meadow wearing sparkly stuff or some reprehensibly gay sh*t like that, you should probably at least give this a try.\nReview by BigHans (4.5/5)\n\n\nTrack List:\n01.Le Secret (2011) (13:34)\n02.Elevation (2011) (13:56)\n03.Le Secret (2005) (14:34)\n04.Elevation (2005) (12:46)\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: French\nGenre: Shoegazing, post-metal, black metal\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~800-1000 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ad2dad4b459f70231ddfad2946346a8e5f7590d","amp;dn":"%282011%29+Alcest+-+Le+Secret+%28EP+Re-release%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ad2dad4b459f70231ddfad2946346a8e5f7590d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,210,218,212,180,89,247,2,49,221,250,210,148,99,70,168,229,247,89,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
