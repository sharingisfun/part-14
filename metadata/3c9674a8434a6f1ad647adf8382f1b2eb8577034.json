But when a bomb goes off in the Bonwit Teller Department Store the police go insane trying to figure out what's going on. Soon, a man named Simon calls and asks for McClane. Simon tells Inspector Walter Cobb that McClane is going to play a game called &quot;Simon Says&quot;. He says that McClane is going to do the tasks he assigns him. If not, he'll blow off another bomb. With the help of a Harlem electrician, John McClane must race all over New York trying to figure out the frustrating puzzles that the crafty terrorist gives him. But when a bomb goes off in a subway station right by the Federal Reserve (the biggest gold storage in the world) things start to get heated up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nFormat : MKV/AVC\r\nWriting Library : x264\r\nDuration : 2h 8mn\r\nBitrate : 5 022 Kbps\r\nResolution=Width/Height : 1920 x 1080\r\nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio:-\r\n\r\nFormat : AC3\r\nBitrate : 640 Kbps\r\nChannels :6 Channels\r\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSample Rate : 48KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nSubs : Dutch, Danish, Finnish, German, Icelandic, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish\r\n\r\nCast\r\n\r\nBruce Willis : John McClane\r\nJeremy Irons : Simon Gruber\r\nSamuel L.
