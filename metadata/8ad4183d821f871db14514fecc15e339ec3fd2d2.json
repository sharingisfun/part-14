I've played for about 3h yesterday (singleplayer AND MULTIPLAYER) and it works flawless - NO CRASHES, NO SOFTWARE RENDERING, AND THE FRAMERATE IS MOSTLY VERY SMOOTH (~50 FPS).\n\nJust for comparison I have Windows 7 x64, 4GB RAM and ATI HD 6670.\n\nJust follow the bellow instructions EXACTLY, and it will work:\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Mount the .iso (with Daemon tools etc..)\n\n2. Install the game\n\n3. Copy contents from the &quot;patch1&quot; folder into where you installed the game\n\n4. THEN copy contents from the &quot;patch2&quot; folder into where you installed the game\n\n5. ALWAYS run the DKII-dx.exe NOT DKII.exe\n\n6. ????\n\n7.
