Since its first edition, published in 1990, it has taught its readers how to develop new built environments while conserving natural resources. No other book presents such a comprehensive approach to planning that is rooted in ecology and design. And no other book offers a similar step-by-step method for planning with an emphasis on sustainable development. This second edition of The Living Landscape offers Frederick SteinerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s design-oriented ecological methods to a new generation of students and professionals.\n\nThe Living Landscape offers\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ a systematic, highly practical approach to landscape planning that maximizes ecological objectives, community service, and citizen participation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ more than 20 challenging case studies that demonstrate how problems were met and overcome, from rural America to large cities\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ scores of checklists and step-by-step guides\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ hands-on help with practical zoning, land use, and regulatory issues\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ coverage of major advances in GIS technology and global sustainability standards\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ more than 150 illustrations.\n\nAs Steiner emphasizes throughout this book, all of us have a responsibility to the Earth and to our fellow residents on this planet to plan with vision. We are merely visiting this planet, he notes; we should leave good impressions.\n\n\nPaperback: 496 pages\nPublisher: Island Press; 2 edition (March 23, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1597263966\nISBN-13: 978-1597263962","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b9e5a91a8e4c512419cb53a64f9954a26ecfa47","amp;dn":"The+Living+Landscape+%2C2nd+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b9e5a91a8e4c512419cb53a64f9954a26ecfa47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,158,90,145,168,228,197,18,65,156,181,58,100,249,149,74,38,236,250,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
