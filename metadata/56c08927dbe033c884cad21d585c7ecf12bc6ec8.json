But in 2003, a Sicilian woman in Brooklyn investigated the cardboard barrels that had long lain undisturbed in her basement and chanced upon the metal master tapes of those long-lost 1944 recordings.\nCondensed into a four-CD set of 54 songs, inventively packaged with a 68-page booklet, what immediately hits you is the startling clarity. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s none of the graininess that invariably accompanies such ancient discoveries ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and afflicts many of the compilations previously issued in WoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and it sounds as if heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing right in front of your nose. To most people now, Woody Guthrie is an almost mythical figure canonised by Dylan, Springsteen et al but, perhaps for the first time, hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the chance to grasp the full essence of the man behind the legend and the authenticity that makes him such an enduringly influential folk music giant.\nThe four CDs are thematically differentiated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ WoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Roots features many of the old blues and country songs that coloured his Oklahoma upbringing; Woody the Agitator includes union songs and other material that laid the foundations for the protest movement; Woody, Cisco &amp; Sonny is a good-time blast with kindred spirits Cisco Houston and Sonny Terry; and WoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Greatest Hits is mostly stuff we know already. Each is magnificent but the icing on the cake is six previously unheard songs, including the mighty Tear the Fascists Down.\nIf anyone had any doubts about the continuing relevance of Woody Guthrie, this blows them clean out of the water.\nTrack List:\nCD1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ WoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½GreatestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Hits\n\n\n01- This Land Is Your Land\n02ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Going Down The Road (I AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½t Gonna Be Treated This Way)\n03ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Talking Sailor\n04ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Philadelphia Lawyer\n05ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hard TravelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n06 - Jesus Christ\n07ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Sinking Of The Reuben James\n08ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pretty Boy Floyd\n09ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Grand Coulee Dam\n10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Nine Hundred Miles\n11ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Going Down The Road (I AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½t Gonna Be Treated This Way) 2\n11ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Going Down The Road (I AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½t Gonna Be Treated This Way)\n12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ My Daddy (Flies A Ship In The Sky)\n13ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bad Repetation \n\nCD2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ WoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½s Roots\n\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Poor Boy\n02ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Worried Man Blues\n03ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A Picture From LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½s Other Side\n04ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Buffalo Skinners\n05ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hard AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½t It Hard\n06ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Stewball\n07ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Stackolee\n08ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gypsy Davy\n09ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Little Darling Pal Of Mine\n10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ What Did The Deep Sea Say\n11ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Chisholm Trail\n12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Put My Little Shoes Away\n13ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Will You Miss Me When IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½m Gone\n14ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ John Henry \n\nCD3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Woody The Agitator\n\n01ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½m Gonna Join That One Big Union (You Gotta Go Down And Join The Union)\n02ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hangnot, Slipnot\n03ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gonna Roll The Union On\n04ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Ludlow Massacre\n05ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sally DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½t You Grieve\n06ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Harriet TubmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½s Ballad Part 1\n07ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Harriet TubmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½s Ballad Part 2\n08ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Tear The Facists Down\n09ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ When The Yanks Go Marching In\n10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ You Can Hear My Whistle Blow\n11ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Union Burying Ground\n12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ You Gotta Go Down And Join The Union \n\nCD4 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Woody, Cisco And Sonny Jam The Blues, Hollers, And Dances\n\n01 Train Breakdown\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Do You Ever Think Of Me (aka At My Window)\n03ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar Rag\n04ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Square Dance Medley\n05  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar Breakdown\n06 - Raincrow Bill\n07ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½t NobodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½s Business\n08  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Stepstone\n09- Ezekiel Saw The Wheel\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bile Them Cabbage Down\n11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deville Girl\n12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar Blues\n13 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½s Ferry Blues\n14ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ More Pretty Girls Than One\n15ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ SonnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½s Flight \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56c08927dbe033c884cad21d585c7ecf12bc6ec8","amp;dn":"Woody+Guthrie+My+Dusty+Road%284+Cd%29%28+%5Bflac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56c08927dbe033c884cad21d585c7ecf12bc6ec8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,192,137,39,219,224,51,200,132,202,210,29,88,92,126,207,18,188,110,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
