Plus it takes the pressure off my seed-machine. And It can use some relief now.. :-)\n\nLike the description say; this is the New King James Version Old Testament Dramatized/narrated.\n\nI must, in all honesty, tell you that I found this (finally) on the net somewhere, and I thank the original uploader &quot;TV_Dude&quot; for it. It was included in the whole Bible as Audio book, then I disassembled it, tagged it properly, and even threw in a little cover art in the tagging. That way it shows what you're listening to on your iPods or what ever you use for heart-washing and cleansing yourselves in the bath of the Water of Life, God's Word.\n\nIt's,in my opinion, and I must be honest, not a very good narrative/dramatized Old Testament you've got here. He tends to &quot;just read it&quot;, and doesn't seem to understand what he is holding in his hands, but like I say, that's just my opinion. You should never the less take good care of it. And for the blind, it's the only way besides Braille to actually hear/read the Word of God. One day the Words in these books and your knowledge of them will be the only thing that stand between you and a heartless world. Treasure this. Make copies. Store some. Give them away. Freely.. :-)\n\nAnd there's a New Testament Dramatized uploaded on this site too:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5088778&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5088778&lt;/a&gt;\n \nThat one's really good narrated and dramatized, and has double the bitrate of the other uploads I've heard of this New testament version. Not so &quot;tin can&quot; in the sound. Actually resembles more the human voice than a Edison wax-cylinder. It's more like &quot;Your Master's Voice&quot;, actually.. :-)\n\nGod bless you all.\n\nVerifire.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;334556415a555a41565e525a5f73545e525a5f1d505c5e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f9d856379cbdef66ce413390f1f25b5b96c95be","amp;dn":"NKJV+Dramatized+Old+Testament+%5Bmp3%4032%5D%5BVerifire%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f9d856379cbdef66ce413390f1f25b5b96c95be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,157,133,99,121,203,222,246,108,228,19,57,15,31,37,181,185,108,149,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
