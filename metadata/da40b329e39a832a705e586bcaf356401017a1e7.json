The band even managed to make a foray onto the U.S. Top 40 charts in 1992 with the infectious &quot;Rush.&quot; \nWith his place already secure in rock annals, Jones' work with BAD was much more lighthearted, but it cannily anticipated the influence electronics and technology would have on music. Despite the dated feel of some of Planet BAD, it's also undeniable that the band was a more interesting venture than it was sometimes given credit.
