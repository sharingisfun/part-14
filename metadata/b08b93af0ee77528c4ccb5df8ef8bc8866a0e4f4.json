It was released on November 21, 1995. Fresh Horses peaked at no.2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and no.1 on the Top Country Albums chart. (wikipedia)\n\nBrooks commented on the album saying: Everyone was expecting this album to be pop. Everyone said we were leaving (country). For the first time ever, I was involved (in writing) in eight of the 10 cuts, so it's a huge reflection of myself. It's the things I enjoy singing about. I got to sing about the band on the road, I got to sing about cowboys, and more importantly, the women who put up with those cowboys.\n\n- - -\n\nGarth Brooks - Fresh Horses 1995\n(Pearl Records, Capitol)\n\n 1.
