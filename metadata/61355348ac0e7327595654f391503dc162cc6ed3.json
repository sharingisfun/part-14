It is one of the \n\nworld's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in \n\nclubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.\n\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century, computers have been programmed to play \n\nchess with increasing success, to the point where home computers can play chess at a \n\nvery high level. In the past two decades computer analysis has contributed \n\nsignificantly to chess theory, particularly in the endgame. The computer Deep Blue \n\nwas the first machine to overcome a reigning World Chess Champion in a match, when \n\nit defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess&lt;/a&gt;\n\nthanks enjoy...!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61355348ac0e7327595654f391503dc162cc6ed3","amp;dn":"chess+game+play","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61355348ac0e7327595654f391503dc162cc6ed3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,53,83,72,172,14,115,39,89,86,84,243,145,80,61,193,98,204,110,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
