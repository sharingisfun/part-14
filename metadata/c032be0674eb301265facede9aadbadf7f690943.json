Supported by vibrant visuals that include abundant illustrations, photographs, and photo-enhanced maps, the text focuses on human evolution and biology to help you master basic biological principles of physical anthropology so you'll be able to better understand human origins and our place in the biological world. Offering balanced coverage of the topic areas you'll cover in class (heredity and evolution, primates, hominid evolution, and contemporary human evolution) this edition emphasizes the chronology of fossil finds instead of just describing the fossils and the sites where they were found. The authors also interpret each fossil within the framework of the story of human evolution. New features like &quot;Why It Matters&quot; further emphasize the fossils' evolutionary significance, and often even propose the relevance of chapter materials to our everyday lives. The seventh edition provides thorough coverage of cutting-edge advances in molecular biology and expanded coverage of population biology and human variation. It also includes powerful learning tools, including a robust text website. Altogether, ESSENTIALS OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, Seventh Edition, integrates up-to-date coverage of the latest finds and relevant technologies in a format and writing style designed to help all students master the material.\n\n\n# Paperback: 427 pages\n# Publisher: Wadsworth Publishing; 8 edition (March 11, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0840032595\n# ISBN-13: 978-0840032591","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c032be0674eb301265facede9aadbadf7f690943","amp;dn":"Essentials+of+Physical+Anthropology+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c032be0674eb301265facede9aadbadf7f690943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,50,190,6,116,235,48,18,101,250,206,222,154,173,186,223,127,105,9,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
