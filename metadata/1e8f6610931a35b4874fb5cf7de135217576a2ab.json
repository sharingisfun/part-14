So please any comments for improvement would be great. This torrent file should contain the latest Cisco:\n\nVideos\nEbook\nSupplemental Material \n\nThe supplemental Material came from the ICND 1 cd that came with my Cisco book ICND1 by Wendall Odem. I recently took the exam and passed using these materials along with the Boson CCNP 6 simulator and CBT Nuggets ICND 1( This is the best source to learn sub netting ). Also I will be creating a torrent with the following: CBT Nuggets ICND 1 &amp; 2, Cisco ebooks ICND 1 &amp; 2 with supplemental material and Cisco videos, along with the Boson CCNP 6 simulator. This will hopefully be the most comprehensive package out on the piratebay. This is for those who dont have the cash but really want to learn and certify in the Cisco world. My ETA for this other to be complete will be by this weekend 12/12/09. I also have the ICND 1 Boson pretests that are very similar to the exam as far as how the questions are worded and flow but it requires activation and even though I have the activation key I dont know that it would work for all. If anyone has any ideas into this Im up for comments.\n\nSincerely,\n\nProtongeek","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8f6610931a35b4874fb5cf7de135217576a2ab","amp;dn":"Cisco+ICND+1+Videos+and+Supplemental+Material","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8f6610931a35b4874fb5cf7de135217576a2ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,143,102,16,147,26,53,180,135,79,181,207,125,225,53,33,117,118,162,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
