Lewis and Rhys are a young couple and have made their house their own but have run out of ideas when it comes to the garden.With only three fences, a shed and a few weeds to work with, can the designers transform this characterless plot into the chic 'outdoor room' the couple dream of and do it all within their Â£4,000 budget? Along the way the designers have tips on which materials to use to add a touch of luxury to your garden and ideas for focal points to make the most of the whole garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 19-Jul-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c4719232f0981763d14457f895c0d6c6e4ff0c0","amp;dn":"Garden+Rescue+S01E07+WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c4719232f0981763d14457f895c0d6c6e4ff0c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,71,25,35,47,9,129,118,61,20,69,127,137,92,13,108,110,79,240,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
