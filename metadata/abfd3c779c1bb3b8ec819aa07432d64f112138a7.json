This is an album of extremes, as Waits is unabashedly (and convincingly) sentimental on &quot;On The Nickel&quot; and &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; (later covered by Springsteen) and unflinchingly hard-boiled on the title track and the hustler's anthem &quot;'Til the Money Runs Out.&quot; The concise, compact arrangements (he had never grooved so fiercely) foreshadowed the rhythmic invention to come in Waits' later work.\n\n\n&quot;..a ragged, rugged blues album...the theme of lowlife redemption, of escape, is ever present..&quot;\n\n&quot;An album of contrasts, HEARTATTACK AND VINE manages to encapsulate Waits's ongoing love of jazz...&quot;\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nBob Alcivar - String Arrangement, Orchestral Arrangement, Conductor\nRonnie Barron - Hammond Organ, Piano\nRoland Bautista - Electric Guitar, 12-String Guitar\nGreg Cohen - Bass\nVictor Feldman - Percussion, Chimes, Glockenspiel\nJim Hughart - Bass\nPlas Johnson - Tenor Sax, Baritone Sax\nMichael Lang - Piano\nLarry Taylor - Bass\n&quot;Big John&quot; Thomassie - Drums\nTom Waits - Vocals, Electric Guitar, Piano\nJerry Yester - Orchestral Arrangement, Conductor\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 - Heartattack and Vine\n02 - In Shades\n03 - Saving All My Love for You\n04 - Downtown\n05 - Jersey Girl\n06 - 'Til the Money Runs Out\n07 - On the Nickel\n08 - Mr. Siegal\n09 - Ruby's Arms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abfd3c779c1bb3b8ec819aa07432d64f112138a7","amp;dn":"Tom+Waits+-+Heartattack+And+Vine++%5B1980%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abfd3c779c1bb3b8ec819aa07432d64f112138a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,253,60,119,156,27,179,184,236,129,154,160,116,50,214,79,17,33,56,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
