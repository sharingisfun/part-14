Well I had to reinstall Jeppview on my computer. Pulled out all my various Jeppesen disks only to find out I had way too many downloads burned to disk. I go a little torrent crazy from time to time, anyhoo,\nIt took forever and after slooowly going insaaane, I finally got it to install and take the stupid site key so it would run. \n\nI figured some other poor soul out there just might have the same problem so I put together the three disks needed to do a perfect install every time. Now I do not take any credit for these disks, they are all from some genius who knows what they are doing, I just edited the install file so dummies like me could enjoy a great program like Jeppview.\n\nZip file includes: Jeppview Flitedeck 3.5 program disk, cycle 0901 D1 and D2, install txt and Jeppesen Chart trainer\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb0bdff78a569c280b92432bde56777fcb0ff2b0","amp;dn":"FSX+FS2004+-+-jeppesen+Jeppview+3.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb0bdff78a569c280b92432bde56777fcb0ff2b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,11,223,247,138,86,156,40,11,146,67,43,222,86,119,127,203,15,242,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
