As elegantly designed as Macs are, a connected world means that their popularity attracts the attention of malware writers and virus engineers. Not only can malware and other threats attack the Mac OS X platform directly, but Macs can also serve as a carrier of Windows or Linux-based threats. Network shares, email and removable media like USB keys are easy ways for multiplatform malware to spread undetected. Additionally, third party applications which are not consistently patched and updated, are prime targets for hackers to gain control of user systems.\n\nESET NOD32 Antivirus for Mac brings protection that Windows users have trusted in and depended on: the smart proactive detection and small footprint of our ThreatSenseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® technology. ESET NOD32 Antivirus will keep you and your network safe from emerging and cross-platform threats without system slowdowns. Advanced heuristic technology recognizes and nullifies novel threats while other AV solutions are still waiting hours or days for signature updates. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESET NOD32 Antivirus for MacIf you are currently using a prior version of the beta software, please download this version, uninstall the prior version and install this version in its place.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFeatures:\n\n\nLatest News\n\nJune 10, 2010\nPublic Beta 2 has been released for ESET NOD32 Antivirus for Mac.
