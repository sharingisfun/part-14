Smith\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nLooking ahead to future airpower requirements, this engaging and ground-breaking book on the history and future of American combat airpower argues that the USAF must adapt to the changes that confront it or risk decline into irrelevance. To provide decision makers with the necessary analytical tools, Jeffrey J. Smith uses organizational modeling to help explain historical change in the USAF and to anticipate change in the future. While the analysis and conclusions it offers may prove controversial, the book aims to help planners make better procurement decisions, institute appropriate long-term policy, and better organize, train, and equip the USAF for the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30671159c96ddeebd7197403c8724217fd7732c1","amp;dn":"Tomorrow%27s+Air+Force%3A+Tracing+the+Past%2C+Shaping+the+Future","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30671159c96ddeebd7197403c8724217fd7732c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,103,17,89,201,109,222,235,215,25,116,3,200,114,66,23,253,119,50,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
