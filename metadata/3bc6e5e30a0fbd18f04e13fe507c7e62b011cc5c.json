Renowned semiotician Marcel Danesi adds his signature insight to the debate by delving deep into pop culture through a consideration of symbols. DanesiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treatment of letters, such as the X in Ã¢â‚¬Å“X-Rated,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Ã¢â‚¬Å“iÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Ã¢â‚¬Å“iPod,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and other such symbols, reveals an ancient mythic structure that blends the sacred and profane dimensions of human psychic life. Danesi takes the reader on a remarkable exploration of the radical turns in American society, a society in which the search for pleasure and sexual expression often reign supreme. X-Rated! is a fascinating trip through what gives pop culture its secret appeal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bc6e5e30a0fbd18f04e13fe507c7e62b011cc5c","amp;dn":"X-Rated%21%3A+The+Power+of+Mythic+Symbolism+in+Popular+Culture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bc6e5e30a0fbd18f04e13fe507c7e62b011cc5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,198,229,227,10,15,189,24,240,78,19,254,80,124,126,98,176,17,204,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
