They started out as a death metal band called Green Carnation, but with the departure of main composer/guitarist Tchort to the band Emperor, they started the project called In the WoodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ releasing a demo in 1993, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Isle of MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and a full-length album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeart of the AgesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, in 1995. This album was unique to the time since the band expanded the limits of their black metal style into the soothing of keyboards and female vocals, combined with eerie distorted vocals and clean singing as well. The following, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOmnioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, is often regarded as their best album, featuring even more experimental music, 11 minute songs with more female vocals and reflective lyrics, together with magical instrumental overtures. The third album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStrange in StereoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ brought an enigmatic change in style, since music got far more depressive and changing.\n\nBy the year 1999, Tchort returned to Green Carnation, so In the WoodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ released their last album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThree Times Seven on a PilgrimageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a compilation of three of their previous 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ featuring covers from Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane and King Crimson, together with some newly released and rebuilt songs (like the new version of Child of Universal tongue). Since the beginning their lineup went through many changes, regularly consisting of X. Botteri, Jan Transit, C:M. Botteri and A. Kobro.\n\nAfter releasing Three Times Seven on a Pilgrimage, they held a farewell performance in their home town of Kristiansand which featured all musicians including the former members. The performance was recorded and released as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive at the Caledonien HallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in 2003. It was confirmed that this was the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last official release. Some of the members went on to play in the similarly-styled band Green Carnation, others took up personal projects and founded the independent label Karmakosmetix Records, created to support new experimental bands such as In the WoodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ was in its time.\n\n\nNot to be confused with the New Jersey band In The Woods (who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at the end of the name)\n\n\nDiscography includes\n\n1995 - HEart of the Ages (studio album)\n1997 - Omnio (studio album)\n1999 - Strange in Stereo (studio album)\n2000 - Three Times Seven on a Pilgimage (7'', covers, rare)\n2003 - Live At The Caledonien Hall\n2006 - A Return to the Isle of Men (re-edition of the 1993 demo Isle of Men plus rare)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afdf4b8ae6c7587d176c1f08017cabd72c396357","amp;dn":"In+the+Woods...+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afdf4b8ae6c7587d176c1f08017cabd72c396357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,223,75,138,230,199,88,125,23,108,31,8,1,124,171,215,44,57,99,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
