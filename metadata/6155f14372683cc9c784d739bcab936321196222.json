I want to get everything down \n\npat.\n\nSetting\n\nThe game takes place on the fictional continent of Endiness. It is a geographically diverse land, with each climate zone being home to a different nation. The game begins in Serdio, a temperate region that is undergoing a civil war at the beginning of the game. West of Serdio is the desert nation of Tiberoa. North of Serdio are the icy regions of Gloriano and Mille Seseau. Mille Seseau is a forested mountain, while Gloriano is an icy desert.\n\nStory\n\nThe story begins when Dart, the protagonist, is heading home from a 5 year long journey to pursue the black monster, who killed his parents and destroyed his birth city: Neet. On the way, he is attacked by Feyrbrand, a dragon controlled by the Sandora, a rebel faction in the Serdian civil war. After Dart gets hit by the dragon, he gets saved by a mysterious female heroine named Rose, though they soon part ways. When he arrives at his hometown, Seles, he discovers that it has been destroyed by Sandora, and that Shana, DartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s childhood friend (and later in the game, his love interest), has been taken away. Dart sets out to rescue her. Throughout the game, he is periodically joined by people that he helps along the way.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6155f14372683cc9c784d739bcab936321196222","amp;dn":"Legend+of+Dragoon+PSP+Eboot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6155f14372683cc9c784d739bcab936321196222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,85,241,67,114,104,60,201,199,132,215,57,188,171,147,99,33,25,98,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
