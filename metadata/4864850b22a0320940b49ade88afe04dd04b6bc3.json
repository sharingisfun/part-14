Garfunkel's pure, high tenor had been one of the most distinctive elements of the duo's music, yet he wasn't responsible for the songwriting -- Simon wrote all of the group's hits. Not surprisingly, Garfunkel relied on other songwriters, from Jimmy Webb and Randy Newman, in addition to rock &amp; roll standards like &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You,&quot; throughout his solo career. As a solo performer, he was never quite as successful as he was with Simon &amp; Garfunkel, yet he did have a number of Top 40 hits in the mid-'70s. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t100.00% CDDA &amp; 100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tSony Music Japan\nCatalog:\t\tSICP 20426-7\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Bridge Over Troubled Water (Simon &amp; Garfunkel)\n02.All I Know\n03.Perfect Moment\n04.For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her\n05.For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her (Duet With James Taylor)\n06.I Only Have Eyes For You\n07.99 Miles From L.A.\n08.(What A) Wonderful World (With James Taylor And Paul Simon)\n09.Bright Eyes\n10.Two Sleepy People\n11.Skywriter\n12.Scarborough Fair/Canticle\n13.Some Enchanted Evening\n14.The Promise\n15.The Thread\n16.Lena\n17.Barbara Allen\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Kathy's Song\n02.Long Way Home\n03.Scissors Cut\n04.The Sound Of Silence\n05.Breakaway\n06.So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\n07.Waters Of March\n08.The Decree\n09.I Wonder Why\n10.Disney Girls\n11.My Little Town\n12.O Come All Ye Faithful\n13.A Heart In New York\n14.I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face\n15.April Come She Will\n16.When A Man Loves A Woman\n17.In Cars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4864850b22a0320940b49ade88afe04dd04b6bc3","amp;dn":"Art+Garfunkel+-+The+Singer+%282012%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4864850b22a0320940b49ade88afe04dd04b6bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,100,133,11,34,160,50,9,64,180,154,222,136,175,224,77,208,75,107,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
