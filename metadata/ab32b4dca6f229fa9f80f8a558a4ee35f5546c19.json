The Caliph will give her hand to the suitor that brings back the rarest treasure after seven moons. The thief sets off on a magical journey while, unbeknownst to him, another suitor, the Prince of the Mongols, is not playing by the rules...\n\nRivalled only by the awesome Babylonian segments of D. W. GriffithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Intolerance, Douglas FairbanksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lavish, extravagant The Thief of Bagdad ranks as the very pinnacle of silent-era spectacle. Yet The Thief of BagdadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blend of Arabian Nights magic, storybook romance, mythopoeic fantasy travelogue, and sense of wonder and fun is incalculably more entertaining and joyous than even the best moments of GriffithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s muddled melodrama.\n\nTaking as its theme the edifying precept &quot;Happiness must be earned,&quot; The Thief of Bagdad introduces Fairbanks as a carefree Middle Eastern street thief (a role that allows the forty-year-old actor to flaunt his acrobatic physique in only baggy breeches and a turban).\n\nThough at first the thief is a cheerful infidel who believes only in taking what he wants, the path to redemption begins when he falls in love with the caliphÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s royal daughter (Julanne Johnston). Initially impersonating a prince to win her hand, the thief winds up scourged and humbled, ultimately seeking the advice of the &quot;holy man&quot; he earlier mocked, who advises him that if he loves a princess, he must &quot;become a prince.&quot;\n\nThe ensuing pilgrimage takes the thief on a fantastic storybook odyssey ranging from the depths of the sea, haunted by sirens and giant spiders, to the world above the clouds, where he finds the abode of the winged horse and the citadel of the moon. The magic of this mythic journey outstrips anything in the highly regarded, possibly overrated 1940 remake.\n\nFairbanksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flamboyant acting style is at its most overwrought here, but his charisma and exuberant physicality carry the day (one critic even suggests that his &quot;daringly, beautifully florid performance is grounded less in dramatics than in dance&quot; [TV Guide]).\n\nWith its unprecedented special effects and imaginative sets, The Thief of Bagdad is perhaps the first great achievement of cinematic epic mythopoeia, and the forerunner to the likes of The Lord of the Rings.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b200/ScreaminJayHawkins/sc/bscap0053.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b200/ScreaminJayHawkins/sc/bscap0053.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b200/ScreaminJayHawkins/sc/bscap0054.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b200/ScreaminJayHawkins/sc/bscap0054.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b200/ScreaminJayHawkins/sc/bscap0055.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b200/ScreaminJayHawkins/sc/bscap0055.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b200/ScreaminJayHawkins/sc/bscap0056.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b200/ScreaminJayHawkins/sc/bscap0056.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------not my rip---------\n\n~~~~~~ The Thief of Bagdad.avi ~~~~~~\n\n\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,471,346,688\n\n\n\n--- Video Information ---\n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:20:22\n\nFrame Count:....................................201925\n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................480\n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................368\n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.304\n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976\n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1197\n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.283&quot;\n\n\n\n--- Audio Information ---\n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192\n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR\n\nAudio Channel Count:............................1\n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
