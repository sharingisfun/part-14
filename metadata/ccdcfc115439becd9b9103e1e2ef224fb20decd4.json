The ease with which all of these tasks can be accomplished makes CSI Bridge the most versatile and productive software program available on the market today. \r\n\r\nUsing CSI Bridge, engineers can easily define complex bridge geometries, boundary conditions and load cases. The bridge models are defined parametrically, using terms that are familiar to bridge engineers such as layout lines, spans, bearings, abutments, bents, hinges and post-tensioning. The software creates spine, shell or solid object models that update automatically as the bridge definition parameters are changed.\r\n\r\nCSI Bridge design allows for quick and easy design and retrofitting of steel and concrete bridges. The parametric modeler allows the user to build simple or complex bridge models and to make changes efficiently while maintaining total control over the design process. Lanes and vehicles can be defined quickly and include width effects. Simple and practical Gantt charts are available to simulate modeling of construction sequences and scheduling.\r\n\r\nCSI Bridge includes an easy to follow wizard that outlines the steps necessary to create a bridge model.\r\n\r\nCompletely integrated within the CSI Bridge design package is the power of the SAPFire analysis engine, including staged construction, creep and shrinkage analysis, cable tensioning to target forces, camber and shape finding, geometric nonlinearity (P-delta and large displacements), material nonlinearity (superstructure, bearings, substructure and soil supports), buckling and static and dynamic analysis. All of these apply to a single comprehensive model. In addition, AASHTO LRFD design is included with automated load combinations, superstructure design and the latest seismic design.\r\n\r\nCSiBridge 2016 18.1.0 | 18.1.1 Enhancements\r\n\r\nGraphical User Interface\r\n\r\nLoads can graphically be displayed on a model for each stage of a staged construction load case.\r\nAll load types in a load case can be graphically displayed in a single view.\r\n\r\nModeling\r\n\r\nNew Zealand vehicle library added.\r\nNew Zealand material property library added.\r\n\r\nBridge Modeler\r\n\r\nSection cuts are automatically created at user-defined â€˜All Spacesâ€™ splice locations.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nNew operation added for staged-construction load cases to allow changing link properties.\r\nEvent-to-event solution strategy implemented as an option for nonlinear direct-integration time-history analysis.\r\n\r\nBridge Design\r\n\r\nAutomated seismic design extended to consider the bridge capacity in the longitudinal direction.\r\nIncrease in the speed of performing bridge superstructure design and rating for certain models\r\n\r\nCSI Bridge Version 18.1.1 with Keygen/License Generator by LAVteam (Thanks!)\r\n\r\n1. Disconnect from the Internet\r\n2. Run Setup 32 or 64 bit (your preferred)\r\n3. Run the keygen sap_v18_kg.exe and in the keygen folder it will be generated a lservrc license file (~4KB)\r\n4. Copy the license file to :\r\na. For 32bit Windows : C:Program Files (x86)Computers and StructuresCSiBridge 2016 and C:Program Files (x86)Computers and StructuresCSiBridge 2016CSiLicensing\r\nb. For 64bit Windows : C:Program FilesComputers and StructuresCSiBridge 2016 and C:Program FilesComputers and StructuresCSiBridge 2016CSiLicensing\r\nc. For another user-chosen folder, find the directory and copy the license file there.\r\n5. Make sure CSiBridge.exe is blocked at the Firewall from connecting to the Internet\r\n\r\nThe How-to-crack above works. If the error &quot;...license file missing etc etc&quot; repeat the step above\r\nLicense is valid for 279 days starting from 15/03/2016 (ends somewhere in mid December 2016). If you want this time not to end :\r\n1. Change time at your windows clock and put it some years before 2016\r\n2. Wait for the next CSI Bridge update (Version 19 or 18.x.x) coming in the beggining of year 2017 (or earlier 2016) or another crack.\r\nUntil then support by keeping this torrent alive by seeding it or adding it to a seedbox, trust me it's worth the share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccdcfc115439becd9b9103e1e2ef224fb20decd4","amp;dn":"CSI+Bridge+Version+18.1.1+%2832bit+%26amp%3B+64bit%29+%2B+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccdcfc115439becd9b9103e1e2ef224fb20decd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,220,252,17,84,57,190,205,155,145,3,225,226,239,34,79,178,13,236,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
