Log files are enclosed.\n\nThe CDs are presented as ONE SINGLE LONG AUDIO FILE for each CD. There's also a \n.cue file which marks the track points. If you need to extract a single song \nfrom this, you must download the whole album, and use a tool like Medieval Cue \nSplitter for Windows, or X Lossless Decoder (XLD) for Mac Users. I don't know \nany specific software for Linux users, if you do, tell me so I can add that info \non future releases.\n\nAlso, you can use Burrrn to burn it directly to a CD, where the tracks will be \nseperated.\n\nAttention: Single .cue/FLAC files. That's simply my personal choice for \nreleasing it, don't argue about it, thanks. IF you don't like it, you've been \nclearly told, so look somewehere else and don't come crying. It's free, ok? Take \nit as it comes.\n\nThe remaining CDs will come shortly. After that, we'll go for the Official Queen \nDiscography\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0beeecdd0da9133fa9d5c15e51dc80ab01fdd612","amp;dn":"Freddie+Mercury+-+The+Solo+Collection+Part+II+%28The+Singles%29+%5BReP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0beeecdd0da9133fa9d5c15e51dc80ab01fdd612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,238,236,221,13,169,19,63,169,213,193,94,81,220,128,171,1,253,214,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
