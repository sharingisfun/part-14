Youâ€™ll learn how Rust offers the rare and valuable combination of statically verified memory safety and low-level controlâ€”imagine C++, but without dangling pointers, null pointer dereferences, leaks, or buffer overruns.\r\n\r\nAuthor Jim Blandyâ€”the maintainer of GNU Emacs and GNU Guileâ€”demonstrates how Rust has the potential to be the first usable programming language that brings the benefits of an expressive modern type system to systems programming. Rustâ€™s rules for borrowing, mutability, ownership, and moves versus copies will be unfamiliar to most systems programmers, but theyâ€™re key to Rustâ€™s unique advantages.\r\n\r\nThis book presents Rustâ€™s rules clearly and economically; elaborates on their consequences; and shows you how to express the programs you want to write in terms that Rust can prove are free of broad classes of everyday errors.\r\n\r\nBTC - 1CZ4nTozpgfgqufWhiXDtBu9pVurd41SPz\r\n\r\nenjoy...\r\n\r\nYOURs INsincerely...\r\n \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                      .:.Shailab.:.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t     https://thepiratebay.la/user/shailab/\r\n\r\n      \t\t\t\t  https://kat.cr/user/shailab/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36618a6c750ce9b71f21790818e38a73f33bdbe4","amp;dn":"Programming+Rust+1st+Edition+Jim+Blandy+Jason+Orendorff+%28shailab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36618a6c750ce9b71f21790818e38a73f33bdbe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,97,138,108,117,12,233,183,31,33,121,8,24,227,138,115,243,59,219,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
