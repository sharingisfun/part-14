All of  this \n   was  made  possible  through  a  combination  of  the  familiar, conceptual \n   simplicity  of  the  analog  synthesis  and  our  new,  F-Domain  synthesis \n   technology.      \n             \n   Concept   \n             \n   At first sight POSEIDON looks  like a simple structured analog  Oscillator \n   -Filter  synthesizer   with  all  controls  visible  at  once.  This gives \n   POSEIDON the ease of use with  nearly no learning curve. The real  power is \n   working  under the  hood: The  oscillator is  nothing less  than the  award \n   winning  spectral modelling  sound generator  of CUBE.  The variable  slope \n   Filter is a completely new  design based on our unique  F-domain synthesis. \n   But lets go step by step... \n             \n   Spectral model oscillator \n             \n   Select a basic sound model  from over hundred delivered with  POSEIDON. The \n   basic sound model  determines the sound  characteristic you want  to start: \n   taking a artificial  model like Sawtooth  gives you analog  style sounds. \n   Use complex  models from  analyzed samples  for earth  shaking ambients and \n   evolving pads. Analyze your own favourite samples to create new models. For \n   really fat sounds use the unisono  mode giving you up to eight  oscillators \n   with variable detune. The bitmap  import function let you even  take images \n   and convert them to soundscapes! \n             \n   Time manipulation \n             \n   POSEIDON  gives  you complete  control  over the  temporal  evolution of  a \n   complex sound model: time stretching, manual time control and freezing made \n   simple with an unprecedented quality!  \n             \n   Model parameters \n             \n   High level controls allow for changing the spectral shape, the  harmonicity \n   and  balances  the level  of  residual noise  and  spectral amount  of  the \n   oscillator model. The inherent sound movement can be blurred in time. \n             \n   F-Domain Filter \n             \n   The  newly  developed F-Domain  filter  allow for  drastic  changes in  the \n   resulting  sound  spectrum. Five  filter  types including  lowpass/highpass \n   characteristic can be used to shape the sound. They have the usual controls \n   like cutoff but also very unusual ones like a variable slope ranging from 0 \n   dB to 72 dB / Octave and independent controls for resonance and  bandwidth! \n   This kind  of controls  are only  possible in  the context  of our F-Domain \n   synthesis technology. This results in an extremely clear filter sound  with \n   breathtaking fast modulation possibilities. \n             \n   The filter type Inverse  interprets the sound model  as a &quot;Source&quot; and  a \n   resonant body &quot;Filter&quot;. The cutoff  parameter shifts the filterbase -  this \n   is the equivalent to making the instrument body smaller or bigger. \n             \n   Spatializer \n             \n   This simple control gives your  sound a distinctive moving distribution  in \n   the stereo panorama. Every atomic sound particle has its own path  through \n   the space ! \n             \n   Sound browser \n             \n   The sound browser in POSEIDON gives you a fast selection of sounds based on \n   five  search criteria:  sound category,  timbre expression  and style.  But \n   POSEIDONs browser  doesnt stop  here. The  current selection  can also be \n   used to generate random new sounds fitting the selection youve made ! \n             \n             \n   New in version 1.4 \n             \n   PoleZero filter technology \n             \n   The new PoleZero Filter gives you up to 8 bandpass and 8 notch filters with \n   user editable frequencies and resonances.  As a result the PoleZero  filter \n   can  model  very  complex resonant  characteristics,  for  example acoustic \n   instrument  bodies, the human vocal tract or something that does not  exist \n   in nature. Even more  you can use two  parameter sets named Filter  A and \n   Filter B  to interpolate between two resonant structures in realtime with \n   the Morph  parameter.  There is also  a Cutoff parameter  which let you \n   move the complete filter  structure up and down  in the frequency range  in \n   realtime. \n             \n   Analog 24 dB lowpass emulation \n             \n   This  new filter  type emulates  the behaviour  of an  analog style  ladder \n   filter with a filter slope of 24 dB / Octave. \n             \n   50 new presets \n             \n             \n             \n   Features: \n             \n             \n   Spectral modelling oscillator \n             \n   - 512 oscillators \n   - harmonic/inharmonic spectra \n   - arbitrary noise spectra \n   - 8 times unisono mode \n   - suboctave / fifth \n             \n   Time machine \n             \n   - free control over temporal evolution of sound \n   - modulatable time stretching/compression \n   - time freeze \n             \n   Timbre control \n             \n   - natural Brightness control \n   - Balance partial spectrum and residual noise \n   - Frequency stretching \n   - Amplitude/Frequency blur filter. \n             \n   F-Domain Filter \n             \n   - Morphing PoleZero filter with up to 8 band/notch filter. \n   - Analog 24 dB Lowpass emulation. \n   - Inverse filter for formant preservation \n   - Lowpass / Highpass / comb / Antiresonance \n   - Unique design with resonance and bandwidth. \n             \n   Spatializer \n             \n   - Independent moving stereo position of each partial \n             \n   Resynthesis \n             \n   - AIFF/WAV sample import \n   - Sine spectrum \n   - Residual spectrum \n   - Bitmap import for sonification of images. \n             \n   Effects   \n             \n   - Chorus/Phaser/Flanger \n   - Distortion \n   - Echo/Delay \n   - Reverb  \n             \n   Arpeggiator \n             \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ceb0dc6f3e864825472017d7849390a49aa701f","amp;dn":"VirSyn.Poseidon.VSTi.RTAS.v1.4.0-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ceb0dc6f3e864825472017d7849390a49aa701f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,235,13,198,243,232,100,130,84,114,1,125,120,73,57,10,73,170,112,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
