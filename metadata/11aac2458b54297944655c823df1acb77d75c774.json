It was released on November 11, 1981 by Epic Records. The album was recorded during their North American tour in fall 1981, known as the Triumph Tour. The live double album was culled from recordings made on the tour's stops in Buffalo, NY; Providence, RI; Atlanta, GA; and New York City, NY. The live album would go on to sell over two million copies worldwide.[1]\nThe 1981 live show featured songs from the group's album Triumph, two songs from Destiny, a medley of their Motown hits, and five songs from lead singer Michael's solo album Off the Wall.\nThe Triumph Tour would be the group's last tour together for three years, while Michael recorded and released the phenomenally successful Thriller album and its singles in 1982 and 1983. The group would reunite for its final tour (sans an injured Jackie Jackson) Ã¢â‚¬â€ Victory Tour Ã¢â‚¬â€ in 1984. In 1988, Rolling Stone magazine described the Triumph Tour as one of the best 25 tours from 1967 to 1987.\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 947 Kbps\nPerformer                                : The Jacksons\nGenre                                    : R&amp;B\nRecorded date                            : 1981\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\n1.&quot;Opening/Can You Feel It&quot;  \t\n2.&quot;Things I Do for You&quot; \n3.&quot;Off the Wall&quot;  \n4.&quot;Ben&quot;  \tWalter Scharf,\n5.&quot;This Place Hotel&quot;  \n6.&quot;She's Out of My Life&quot;  \t\n7.&quot;Movie and Rap Including Excerpts of I Want You Back/Never Can Say Goodbye/Got to Be There&quot;  \t\n8.&quot;Medley: I Want You Back/ABC/The Love You Save&quot; \n \t\n9.&quot;I'll Be There&quot; \n10.&quot;Rock with You&quot;  \n11.&quot;Lovely One&quot;  \t\n12.&quot;Workin' Day and Night&quot;  \t\n13.&quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot;  \n14.&quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot;  \n15.&quot;Working Day And Night (Edit)&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11aac2458b54297944655c823df1acb77d75c774","amp;dn":"The+Jacksons+-+Live%21+%28Triumph+Tour+1981+live+album%29+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11aac2458b54297944655c823df1acb77d75c774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,170,194,69,139,84,41,121,68,101,92,130,61,241,172,183,125,117,199,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
