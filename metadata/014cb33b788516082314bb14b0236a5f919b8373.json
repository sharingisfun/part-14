It was now up to Carnes' fourth album, CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Racers, to regain whatever ground that was lost. To that end, Carnes and her team of collaborators decided to modernize her sound ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which meant that she delved deeply into new wave affectations (the opening of &quot;Young Love&quot; and the included single version of &quot;You Make My Heart Beat Faster&quot; were clearly designed for synth-heavy modern radio), while finding a firm footing in adult contemporary radio with songs like &quot;Met You at the Wrong Time of My Life.&quot; On top of that, Carnes and EMI flooded the market with extended dance mixes of singles, including &quot;Invisible Hands&quot;, &quot;You Make My Heart Beat Faster&quot; and &quot;Hurricane&quot;. This was a standard practice at the time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ nearly every artist had an extended dance or extended vocal mix on the market ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but, in retrospect, it adds an air of desperation to CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Racers. It was as if nobody involved with Kim Carnes had a good idea of how to bring her back into the charts, so they tried anything within reason. All of their efforts backfired. Without a big hit the record crawled to number 97, a major disappointment for an artist who had won Grammys and platinum awards just two years earlier. Looking back, CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Racers is a snapshot of the various styles and sounds of mainstream radio circa 1983, but it had to be more than that to be a hit in 1983, even if it evokes that year strongly decades later.&quot; \n\nWkipedia bio &quot;Make No Mistake, He's Mine&quot;:\n&quot;Make No Mistake, He's Mine&quot; is a popular hit recorded by Barbra Streisand and Kim Carnes. This track was recorded and released on Streisand's 1984 album Emotion. Released as a single, it was a modest success on the pop charts, but did place in the top 10 of the Adult Contemporary chart.\nIn 1987 the song was re-worked as &quot;Make No Mistake, She's Mine&quot; by Kenny Rogers and Ronnie Milsap. This version was a chart-topper, reaching #1 on the Billboard Country chart. Their version would also appear the Adult Contemporary charts and peak at #42. Rogers had previously worked with Carnes in the 1960s in a successful folk group and on the hit singles &quot;Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer&quot; and &quot;What About Me?&quot; (the latter of which was actually meant to feature Streisand, but was recorded with Carnes after she pulled out).\nIn 2002, the track would re-appear on Streisand's compilation Duets. It also surfaced as a track on Carnes' &quot;best of&quot; album Gypsy Honeymoon in 1993.&quot;\n\nWikipedia bio &quot;What About Me?&quot;:\n&quot;What About Me?&quot; is the title of a popular song first recorded in 1984 as a trio by singers Kenny Rogers, Kim Carnes and James Ingram. The song was written by Rogers, noted producer David Foster and singer-songwriter Richard Marx, who had yet to achieve the fame as a musician that he would a few years later (&quot;Right Here Waiting&quot;, &quot;Now and Forever&quot;). It was the lead single from Rogers' 1984 album of the same name.\nRogers has described &quot;What About Me?&quot; as &quot;like a three-way love song...Everybody involved said 'Hey, what about me?' I think it's a beautiful record.&quot; Originally the male and female parts not sung by Rogers were to be performed by Lionel Richie and Barbra Streisand, but after Richie backed out of the project, Streisand did as well. The second proposed trio of singers was Rogers, Olivia Newton-John and Jeffrey Osborne, but Newton-John began working on a duet with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees and decided not to do both projects simultaneously. Osborne had a conflicting schedule as well, so the line-up of Rogers, Carnes and Ingram was ultimately the one that recorded the song.\n&quot;What About Me?&quot; charted on four Billboard singles charts in the United States at the time of its release in late 1984. It was most successful on the adult contemporary chart, where it spent two weeks at number one in November of that year. This was the first adult contemporary chart topper for either Carnes or Ingram, though both had achieved pop hits before this song. For Rogers, this was his eighth (and to date, final) number one on the AC chart. On the Billboard Hot 100, the song peaked at number 15, while it accomplished the rare feat of charting on both the R&amp;B (#57) and country (#70) charts. This was Rogers' second single to reach the R&amp;B chart, following his 1980 hit &quot;Lady&quot;. That song, written by Richie, had reached number 42 on the R&amp;B chart as well as going to number one on the pop, country and AC charts.&quot;\n\nTRACK LIST:\n===========\n\n01. &quot;You Make My Heart Beat Faster (And That's All That Matters)&quot; (Kim Carnes, \n    Dave Ellingson, Martin Page, Brian Fairweather) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32 \n02. &quot;Young Love&quot; (Gary O'Connor) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30 \n03. &quot;Met You at the Wrong Time of My Life&quot; (Paul Wilson, B.P.
