This is the first book of its kind, and I am making way for a new field of science. Do keep in mind though that this is an unfinished book, as the research is still continuing. As more information is discovered and made available, new versions of this book will be released. Join the PLC Forum on the publishers web site to help in our research.\n\n     In this book everything is simplified, and everything is descriptive, explaining in detail how all abilities work and how they connect, so most labels for abilities are not mentioned. However, I have seen and done many things most would deem impossible, so set aside your assumptions because I didn't just work in black projects, I created them. When you have a detailed view of abilities and how they work, such as I do, there is actually only one ability that is the foundation for all abilities. To alter and manipulate matter by thought.\n\n-------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d847bab24f9485da076eb6fb20aebddffc1e3312","amp;dn":"The+Psionics+Handbook+%281st+Edition%29+2014+Project+Life-Command","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d847bab24f9485da076eb6fb20aebddffc1e3312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,71,186,178,79,148,133,218,7,110,182,251,32,174,189,223,252,30,51,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
