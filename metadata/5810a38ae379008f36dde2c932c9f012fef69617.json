In fact, it ended up creating a bewildering world for millions \nof Soviet people. In this light-hearted investigation, one industrial planner \ntells how she decided the people wanted platform shoes, only to discover that \nthey had gone out of fashion by the time that the factory to manufacture them \nhad been built.\n\n02 To The Brink of Eternity. \nFocusing on the men of the Cold War on whom &amp;#039;Dr Strangelove&amp;#039; was based. These \nwere people who believed that the world could be controlled by the scientific \nmanipulation of fear - mathematical geniuses employed by the American Rand \nCorporation. In the end, their visions were the stuff of science fiction \nfantasy.\n\n03 The League of Gentlemen. \nThirty years ago, a group of economists managed to convince British politicians \nthat they had foolproof technical means to make Britain great again. Pandora&amp;#039;s \nBox tells the saga of how their experiments have led the country deeper into \neconomic decline, and asks - is their game finally up?\n\n04 Goodbye Mrs Ant. \nA modern fable about science and society, focusing on our attitude to nature. \nShould we let scientists be the prime movers of social or political change when, \nfor instance, DDT made post-war heroes of American scientists only to be put on \ntrial by other scientists in 1968? What kind of in-fighting goes on between \nrival camps before one scientific truth emerges, and when it does emerge, just \nhow true is it?\n\n\n05 Black Power. \nA look at how former Ghanaian leader Kwame Nkrumah set Africa ablaze with his \nvision of a new industrial and scientific age. At the heart of his dream was to \nbe the huge Volta dam, generating enough power to transform West Africa into an \nadvanced utopia. But as his grand experiment took shape, it brought with it \ndangerous forces Nkrumah couldn&amp;#039;t control, and he slowly watched his metropolis \nof science sink into corruption and debt.\n\n06 A is For Atom.\nAn insight into the rise and fall of nuclear power. In the 1950s scientists and \npoliticians thought they could create a different world with a limitless source \nof nuclear energy. But things began to go wrong. Scientists in America and the \nSoviet Union were duped into building dozens of potentially dangerous plants. \nThen came the disasters of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl which changed views \non the safeness of this invisible fuel.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5810a38ae379008f36dde2c932c9f012fef69617","amp;dn":"Pandora%5C%27s+Box+-+repacked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5810a38ae379008f36dde2c932c9f012fef69617","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,16,163,138,227,121,0,143,54,221,226,201,50,201,240,18,254,246,150,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
