Gil Scott-Heron used to say, &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,&quot; but we all know that he was wrong -- we&amp;#039;ve seen too many pictures of civilians armed with gasoline-filled soda bottles taking on tanks! Ragnar Benson explains how modern-day Davids can slay Goliath in his latest manual on making urban war.\n\nThis book shows how someone can effectively take out enemy tanks, APC&amp;#039;s, fighter aircraft, unarmored vehicles, helicopters, and artillery positions. It truly is a fascinating and interesting book to read. 223 pages.\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world&amp;#039;s longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a22aa55db23cca9f0b9b85eb71f46b08b54e7357","amp;dn":"David%5C%27s+Tool+Kit%3A+A+Citizen%5C%27s+Guide+to+Taking+Out+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a22aa55db23cca9f0b9b85eb71f46b08b54e7357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,42,165,93,178,60,202,159,11,155,133,235,113,244,107,8,181,78,115,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
