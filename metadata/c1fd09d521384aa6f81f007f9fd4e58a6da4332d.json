That torrent is still going strong. The problem is that it took nearly a month to download the thing despite a large numbers of seeders but even larger number of leechers. I got to 95% and sat there at .1 or less for 2 weeks. The original provider states in the comment section that &quot;I seeded the torrent for 5 days straight. I uploaded almost 3TB then. Yes, you read well, 3 freaking terabytes. There were so many hit and runs, and I stopped seeding. It makes me sick that so many people just closed their client after they finished the download.&quot;\n\nMy guess is that just about nobody is willing to store and seed any torrent larger than about 10-12 gig, and not even THAT for very long. Well, since this show is excellent and nobody should have to wait a month to collect a torrent that has more than a thousand leechers, I am taking 974613s torrent of Allo Allo .avi DVD rips and breaking them up by season. I hope that the smaller sizes will encourage and allow people to seed them for longer periods. I will seed each torrent exclusively until it has other seeders, then upload the next one.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1fd09d521384aa6f81f007f9fd4e58a6da4332d","amp;dn":"Allo+Allo+AVI+Season2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1fd09d521384aa6f81f007f9fd4e58a6da4332d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,253,9,213,33,56,74,166,248,31,0,127,159,212,229,138,109,164,51,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
