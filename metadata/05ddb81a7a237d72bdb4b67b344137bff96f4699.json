Their style can be described as &quot;blues-rock&quot; or boogie-rock, dominated by electric and electric slide guitar. The band has achieved 8 gold records, one platinum and one double platinum record. The band had far more success in the United States than home in Britain.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGirls to Chat &amp; Boys to Bounce is the tenth studio album by blues rock band Foghat, released in 1981. It is the first with new guitarist Erik Cartwright.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the Mood for Something Rude is the eleventh studio album by British hard rock band Foghat, released in 1982. All eight tracks on the album were penned by outside writers, and the record is something of a covers album in which the band applies its bluesy rock and roll style over a collection of R&amp;B and country tunes.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nZig-Zag Walk is the twelfth studio album by British hard rock band Foghat, released in 1983. Unlike the previous year's In the Mood for Something Rude, which consisted of all outside material, lead singer Dave Peverett wrote five of the album's ten songs, with guitarist Erik Cartwright contributing a sixth. A few of the songs are given a rockabilly treatment augmenting the blues rock the band is better known for. It would be the band's last album for over a decade until their comeback album, Return of the Boogie Men, in 1994.\n\nProuducer &quot;Franz Leipkin&quot; and keyboardist &quot;Eli Jenkins&quot; are pseudonyms for old bandmate Nick Jameson, who had played in Foghat in 1975 and produced several Foghat albums around that time. Paul Butterfield makes a guest appearance on one song, playing harmonica on &quot;Seven Day Weekend&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ddb81a7a237d72bdb4b67b344137bff96f4699","amp;dn":"Foghat+%5B3+Albums+%2B+Rarities%5D%5B2+CD%27s%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRemastered%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ddb81a7a237d72bdb4b67b344137bff96f4699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,221,184,26,122,35,125,114,189,180,182,123,52,65,55,191,249,111,70,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
