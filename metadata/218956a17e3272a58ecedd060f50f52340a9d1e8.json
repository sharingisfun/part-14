Long Time No See traces her unlikely journey through Orthodox Jewish beginnings and 20 years of Buddhist practice, to a wholly unexpected awakening in 2005 that changes everything.\nJoin Carrie on this true-life odyssey, which begins in the Midwest and travels to sunny California by way of London, Paris, and Sedona, Arizona. Learn the metaphysical lessons offered by a swanky Vegas hotel room and a past-life crime scene (among many others), as Carrie relays the messages of universal truth she is given to share with us all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:218956a17e3272a58ecedd060f50f52340a9d1e8","amp;dn":"Triffet%2C+Carrie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"218956a17e3272a58ecedd060f50f52340a9d1e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,137,86,161,126,50,114,165,142,206,221,6,15,80,245,35,64,169,209,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
