It consists of a mixture of songs and comic spoken interludes.\nThe concept was based on the German Air Ministry's purchase of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, colloquially known as the Widowmaker. In German service these planes had a poor safety record, with 270 of almost 635 Luftwaffe Starfighters lost in accidents during the aircraft's time in service, which lasted from the early 1960s until the mid-1980s. \n Musicians who appeared on the album include members of Hawkwind, The Pink Fairies, Brian Eno, Arthur Brown, and Adrian Wagner. The spoken sketches are primarily performed by Calvert, Viv Stanshall, and Jim Capaldi of Traffic.\n\nGREAT STUFF!
