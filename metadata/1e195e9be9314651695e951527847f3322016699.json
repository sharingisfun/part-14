From the mystic and quasi-religious &quot;Man On A Silver Mountain&quot; to the solid gold anthems of &quot;All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Long Live Rock 'N' Roll&quot; and &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;, each year in the decade of RAINBOW was marked by some of the best songs and performances captured both on record and in concert.\n\nDue on February 11, &quot;The Singles Box Set 1975-1986&quot; gathers all of the band's classic singles from the era in replicas of the original release, alongside a 32-page book featuring details on each of the titles.\n\nPassing through the band were some of the best the genre had to offer. Vocalists Ronnie James Dio and Graham Bonnet, bass player and producer Roger Glover and drummer Cozy Powell, each brought their individual talent to the table to record some of rock's best loved hard rock on those timeless singles.\n\nCD One\n\n01.
