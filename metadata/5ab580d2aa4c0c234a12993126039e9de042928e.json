First she cranks up   \n  the volume on a kitchen classic with a prosciutto and brie toastie    \n  that's ready in moments. Then she goes back to her roots to share     \n  her inspiration for a seriously chocolatey chocolate digestive        \n  cheesecake with white icing - that doesn't involve any cooking.       \n                                                                        \n  Next, salad gets an autumn twist, in a hearty pan-fried balsamic      \n  pear salad with pancetta, gorgonzola and a warm honey dressing, and   \n  in another seasonal treat Lorraine rustles up homely chutney and      \n  gives it a twist with apple, blackberries and cinnamon.               \n                                                                        \n  Then it's Lorraine's favourite meal of the week, Sunday lunch.        \n  Comforting, leisurely and easy, with really slow roast pork shoulder  \n  with crispy, crispy crackling, garlic roast vegetables, gravy and     \n  delicious leftovers. This is home cooking the favourites - what's     \n  not to love?                                                          \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;86f1b2e0e5f4e3f1c6e1ebe7efeaa8e5e9eb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ab580d2aa4c0c234a12993126039e9de042928e","amp;dn":"Home.Cooking.Made.Easy.S01E02.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ab580d2aa4c0c234a12993126039e9de042928e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,181,128,210,170,76,12,35,74,18,153,49,38,3,158,157,224,66,146,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
