Can music and dance be weapons of peace? In 2003, on the eve of the Iraq war, director Iara Lee embarked on a journey to better understand a world increasingly embroiled in conflict and, as she saw it, heading for self-destruction. After several years, travelling over five continents, Iara encountered growing numbers of people who committed their lives to promoting change. This is their story. From IRAN, where graffiti and rap became tools in fighting government repression, to BURMA, where monks acting in the tradition of Gandhi take on a dictatorship, moving on to BRAZIL, where musicians reach out to slum kids and transform guns into guitars, and ending in PALESTINIAN refugee camps in LEBANON, where photography, music, and film have given a voice to those rarely heard, CULTURES OF RESISTANCE explores how art and creativity can be ammunition in the battle for peace and justice.\n\n\n\nGenre: Documentary\nCast: N/A\nRuntime: 73 minutes\nRatings: IMDB: 6.7 (18 votes) | RT: No Reviews Yet \n\nCultures.Of.Resistance.2010.DOCU.DVDRip.XviD-JETSET\n1 CD | 700 MB | cultofresist2010-jetset\nQuality: XviD, 624x352@1242 kb/s | MP3, 128 kb/s\nSubtitles: Eng,Ger,Spa,Fra,Arab,Portu,Rus,Hindi \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6554d899acb6a17d0264a4bab9b41ad71094ae30","amp;dn":"Cultures+Of+Resistance+2010+DOCU+DVDRip+XviD-JETSET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6554d899acb6a17d0264a4bab9b41ad71094ae30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,84,216,153,172,182,161,125,2,100,164,186,185,180,26,215,16,148,174,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
