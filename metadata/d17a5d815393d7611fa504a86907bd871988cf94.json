Her personal relationships are limited and the only family she has left is her estranged stepmother, Patricia. So when Patricia suddenly shows up an invites her on a trip to St. Isabel (an island Madison used to visit with her Father) it comes as a complete surprise. Once on the island Madison meets Blake, a local guide. Blake plans a paddle board excursion and takes Madison to a remote part of the island. Once out in the ocean, Madison has a panic attack (or so it seems) and falls off her board and reportedly drowns. Miraculously, Madison survives the ordeal and somehow makes her way out of the remote jungle and back to the resort. Once she arrives, she's stunned to see Blake and Patricia together! When Madison goes looking for answers, she discovers that this vacation isn't what it seems, and that she's in fact embroiled in a dark conspiracy that involves her late father.\n\nCast: \n\nMalese Jow ...
