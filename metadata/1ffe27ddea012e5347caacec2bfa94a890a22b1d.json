We react quickly to integrate detection and removal of what we think can be a global threat and affect a big amount of users across the world.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s a little summary of what RogueKiller is able to do:\r\n\r\nKill malicious processes\r\nStop malicious services\r\nUnload malicious DLLs from processes\r\nFind/Kill malicious hidden processes\r\nFind and remove malicious autostart entries, including :\r\nRegistry keys (RUN/RUNONCE, â€¦)\r\nTasks Scheduler (1.0/2.0)\r\nStartup folders\r\nFind and remove registry hijacks, including :\r\nShell / Load entries\r\nExtension association hijacks\r\nDLL hijacks\r\nMany, many others â€¦\r\nRead / Fix DNS Hijacks\r\nRead / Fix Proxy Hijacks\r\nRead / Fix Hosts Hijacks\r\nRead / Fix malicious Master Boot Record (MBR) or Volume Boot Record (VBR), even hidden with a rootkit\r\nList / Fix SSDT â€“ Shadow SSDT â€“ IRP Hooks (Even with inline hooks)\r\nFind and restore system files patched / hidden by a rootkit\r\n\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\n\r\n* Just Run to use...\r\n\r\n*Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ffe27ddea012e5347caacec2bfa94a890a22b1d","amp;dn":"RogueKiller+10.11.4.0+32+%26amp%3B+64+Bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ffe27ddea012e5347caacec2bfa94a890a22b1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,254,39,221,234,1,46,83,71,202,172,236,43,250,148,168,144,162,43,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
