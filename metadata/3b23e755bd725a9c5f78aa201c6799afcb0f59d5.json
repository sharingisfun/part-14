Furst \n194 pages\nPDF\nPublisher: Chandler &amp; Sharp Pub (June 1976)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0883165171\n\nThis book is an introduction to some of the hallucinogenic drugs in their cultural and historical context, stressing their important role in religion, ritual, magic and curing.\n\n&quot;Dr. Furst demonstrates with a wealth of cross-cultural and historical data and some of his own first-hand experiences the often decisive role hallucinogens have sometimes played, and continue to play, in the maintenance of social systems in the traditional world, and their positive role in rituals of religion or initiation, mythology and symbolism, and in art, as well as in psychotherapy and curing of physical ills. I strongly recommend this book to every reader interested in our heritage and in human behavior in general....&quot;\n-- Norman E.
