In radar, it is used to measure the velocity of detected objects. This highly practical resource provides thorough working knowledge of the micro-Doppler effect in radar, including its principles, applications and implementation with MATLAB codes. The book presents code for simulating radar backscattering from targets with various motions, generating micro-Doppler signatures, and analyzing the characteristics of targets. In this title, professionals will find detailed descriptions of the physics and mathematics of the Doppler and micro-Doppler effect. The book provides a wide range of clear examples, including an oscillating pendulum, a spinning and precession heavy top, rotating rotor blades of a helicopter, rotating wind-turbine blades, a person walking with swinging arms and legs, a flying bird, and movements of quadruped animals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92468788fe0ef691d92b3770ae43880585a1c3ee","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+The+Micro-Doppler+Effect+in+Radar+%28Artech+House+Rad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92468788fe0ef691d92b3770ae43880585a1c3ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,70,135,136,254,14,246,145,217,43,55,112,174,67,136,5,133,161,195,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
