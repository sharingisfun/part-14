Gifford was himself replaced by Bones Hillman in 1987.[1][2][4] Through a long and distinguished career, the band became known for its driving hard-rock sound, intense live performances and political activism, particularly in aid of anti-nuclear, environmentalist and indigenous causes.[6]\n\nMidnight OilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s albums which peaked in the Australian Top Ten were 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Red Sails in the Sunset, Species Deceases, Diesel and Dust, Blue Sky Mining, Scream in Blue, Earth and Sun and Moon, Breathe, 20,000 Watt R.S.L., Redneck Wonderland, The Real Thing, Capricornia and Flat Chat.[7][8] Australian Top Ten singles were &quot;Power and the Passion&quot;, &quot;The Dead Heart&quot;, &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; and &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot;.[7][8] Aside from chart success, both &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; and &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; were listed by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) in the Top 30 best Australian songs of all time in 2001.[9] In December 2002, Garrett announced that he would seek to further his political career and Midnight Oil disbanded. But they would reform for two warm-up shows in Canberra leading up to their performance at one of the &quot;Sound Relief&quot; charity concerts, in honour of the victims of the &quot;Black Saturday&quot; fires and the &quot;Queensland Floods&quot;.\n\nMidnight Oil won eleven Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Awards during its career,[10] including induction into the Hall of Fame in 2006.[11][12] At the induction, ARIA chairman Denis Handlin described Midnight Oil as true legends that always led by example in a uniquely Australian way with music that is powerful, uncompromising, inspiring, entertaining and enduring.[5]\n\nIn 2010 their album Diesel and Dust ranked No. 1 in the book 'The 100 Best Australian Albums' by Toby Creswell, Craig Mathieson and John O'Donnell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlat Chat 2006\n\n\n\nFlat Chat is a compilation album from the Australian band Midnight Oil. It is a collection of their heavier rock songs, which gave them their reputation. The title is taken from a line from their song, Power and the Passion (song).\n\nThe expression `flat-chat` is Australian slang for working or moving as fast as possible.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\tOnly the Strong - 4:34\n2.\tProgress - 3:57\n3.\tDon't Wanna Be the One - 2:59\n4.\tDreamworld - 3:35\n5.\tHercules - 4:28\n6.\tRead About It - 3:56\n7.\tSection 5 (Bus to Bondi) - 3:00\n8.\tCold Cold Change - 3:29\n9.\tRedneck Wonderland - 3:08\n10.\tTell Me the Truth - 4:03\n11.\tStand in Line - 4:48\n12.\tPictures - 3:13\n13.\tWritten in the Heart - 3:10\n14.\tMosquito March - 3:07\n15.\tNo Time for Games - 4:34\n16.\tBest of Both Worlds - 4:04\n17.\tSay Your Prayers - 4:25\n18.\tRun by Night - 3:55\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76678e9a1fa4224cbde6619ea08791ed7d991c9f","amp;dn":"Midnight+Oil+-+Flat+Chat+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2007+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76678e9a1fa4224cbde6619ea08791ed7d991c9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,103,142,154,31,164,34,76,189,230,97,158,160,135,145,237,125,153,28,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
