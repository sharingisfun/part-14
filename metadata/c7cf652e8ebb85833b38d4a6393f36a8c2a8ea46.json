But when reaching out to the murderer for salvation in those last dying moments, a sudden switch takes place.\r\n\r\nNow Kepler is looking out through the eyes of the killer himself, staring down at a broken and ruined body lying in the dirt of the alley.\r\n\r\nInstead of dying Kepler has gained the ability to roam from one body to another, to jump into other people's skin and see through their eyes, live their lives, be it for a few minutes, a few months, or a lifetime.\r\n\r\nKepler means these host bodies no harm and even comes to cherish them intimately, like lovers. But when one host, Josephine Cebula, is brutally assassinated, Kepler embarks on a mission to seek the truth--and avenge Josephine's death.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Peter Kenny\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7cf652e8ebb85833b38d4a6393f36a8c2a8ea46","amp;dn":"Claire+North+-+Touch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7cf652e8ebb85833b38d4a6393f36a8c2a8ea46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,207,101,46,142,187,133,131,59,56,212,166,57,63,54,168,194,168,234,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
