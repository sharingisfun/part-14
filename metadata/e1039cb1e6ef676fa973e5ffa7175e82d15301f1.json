The Ultimate Cook Book, their magnum opus, follows the same approach--over 900 recipes with variations are included for every course and occasion, including breakfast and snacks, plus a wide range of breads and desserts.\n\nIncluded are straightforward takes on old favorites, like roast chicken and hamburgers; innovative versions of familiar fare, such as Grilled Chili, and Banana Layer Cake with Maple Cream Cheese Frosting; and &quot;new&quot; fare like Whole Fried Fish with Two Asian Sauces, Lemonade Bread, and Baked Pasta Casserole with Blue Cheese, Peas, and Artichoke Hearts. Present also are informative side bars, such as Know Your Greens, and equally enlightening notes on ingredients, equipment and techniques.\n\nTitle: The Ultimate Cook Book: 900 New Recipes, Thousands of Ideas\nPublisher(s): William Morrow Cookbooks\nAuthor: Bruce Weinstein ,Mark Scarbrough\nYear: 2007\nFormat: PDF\nISBN: 978-0060833831\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
