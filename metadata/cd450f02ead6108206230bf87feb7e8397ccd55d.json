It's not a photocopy, however; it's hard to imagine Mitchell singing &quot;I'm spacing out, I'm seeing silences between leaves,&quot; as Perhacs does on &quot;Chimacum Rain,&quot; unless Mitchell got spiked with acid right before getting on-stage. In addition, Perhacs is adept at dropping unusual effects and arrangements into the mix, that on occasion have a mildly disquieting and psychedelic vibe. Back to &quot;Chimacum Rain,&quot; for example: double-tracked voices get into a slightly hypnotic, disorienting swirl, and suddenly move into a half-chanted section with doomy background notes from hard-to-identify instruments. &quot;Parallelograms&quot; is a round-like vocal (again with multi-track voices), consisting of exactly eight words, that without warning goes into creepy washes of electronically distorted voices, flutes, and rattles. Not all of the record is unusual, though; much of it's just attractively wistful, moody singer/songwriter folk, sometimes with an engaging folk-jazz backup, sometimes just with a guitar, sometimes enlivened by creative smudges of organ and electric guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd450f02ead6108206230bf87feb7e8397ccd55d","amp;dn":"Linda+Perhacs+-+Parallelograms+%5B1970%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd450f02ead6108206230bf87feb7e8397ccd55d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,69,15,2,234,214,16,130,6,35,11,248,127,235,126,131,151,204,213,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
