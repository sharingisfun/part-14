Vertigo doesn't always work correctly on the Windows 95 version either.\n\n\nIf you like this, try Terminal Velocity and Fury 3 too :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:245098818615d02711436a3337c14e7ab31e4bf6","amp;dn":"Descent+1%2C+2%2C+and+2+Vertigo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"245098818615d02711436a3337c14e7ab31e4bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,80,152,129,134,21,208,39,17,67,106,51,55,193,78,122,179,30,75,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
