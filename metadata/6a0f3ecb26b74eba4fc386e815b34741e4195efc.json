The soundtrack is a kickin&amp;#039; and screamin&amp;#039; mix of top US nu-metal and &quot;dude rock&quot;, with tracks by the likes of Marilyn Manson, System Of A Down, Saliva, Good Charlotte, Orgy and more\n\nThe soundtrack ups the ante with &amp;#039;80s classics covered by &amp;#039;90s alt-rock acts. Depeche Mode and New Order fare best as Smashing Pumpkins (&quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot;) and Scott Weiland (&quot;But Not Tonight&quot;) tackle DM while Orgy (&quot;Blue Monday&quot;) and Stabbing Westward (&quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot;) pump the decibels up for New Order. One-hit wonders also get the nod, whether it&amp;#039;s Teutonic popster Nena (Goldfinger&amp;#039;s ska-driven &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot;), Brits Modern English (Mest&amp;#039;s staccato &quot;I Melt With You&quot;) or Soft Cell (Marilyn Manson&amp;#039;s eerie &quot;Tainted Love&quot;). \nElsewhere, Saliva interprets The Pretenders (&quot;Message Of Love&quot;), Good Charlotte puts a punk-pop spin on OMD (&quot;If You Leave&quot;) and Muse pays homage to the Smiths (&quot;Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want&quot;). The quintessential nod to teen pop culture comes via Phantom Planet (featuring RUSHMORE&amp;#039;s Jason Schwartzman) serving up a harmony-drenched version of Jackson Browne&amp;#039;s &quot;Somebody&amp;#039;s Baby&quot; (originally recorded for the Fast Times At Ridgemont High soundtrack).\n\nBasically whether you like the movie or not this is a really good album, one of the few occasions where a soundtrack really stands up on its own merits and not just as part of the film. It is made up of some classic 80&amp;#039;s songs covered by some great alternative bands/artists from the world of metal/punk/rock the most well known obviously being marilyn mansons cover of soft cells &quot;Tainted Love&quot;. But for me, even better are Muses&amp;#039; cover of The Smiths &quot;Please, please, please, let me get what i want&quot;, System of a downs cover of Berlins&amp;#039; &quot;Metro&quot; and scott weiland covering Depeche Modes&amp;#039; &quot;But Not Tonight&quot;.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a0f3ecb26b74eba4fc386e815b34741e4195efc","amp;dn":"Not+Another+Teen+Movie+Soundtrack+-+Various+Artists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a0f3ecb26b74eba4fc386e815b34741e4195efc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,15,62,203,38,183,78,186,79,195,134,232,21,179,71,65,228,25,94,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
