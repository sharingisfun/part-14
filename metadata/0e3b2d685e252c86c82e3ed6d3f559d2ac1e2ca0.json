When it comes to tearing things apart to find treasures and selling them off to make a profit, they have done it all. The salvaged materials go in a dazzling number of directions, from being re-incorporated into old houses to being built into one-of-a-kind art pieces. Whether it's gutting a hoarder's home or disassembling a crumbling school, every day is a challenge and every day is an opportunity to either capitalize or mess up.
