I'm here to change that.\n\nI've gathered as much as I can here. I'm only missing 1 or 2 demos/EPs, and I'm missing the new split from Ulver. You can probably find the Ulver split very easily.\n\nPlease seed for your fellow music lovers. People are going to grab FLAC if they love the band/are just plain music lovers. I'll be seeding probably for a year because I'll forget to stop seeding. If there are any problems with titles or artwork, use the program MP3Tag to fix it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:372f089a8d7d14520688b3494a87746cd5988d7b","amp;dn":"Sunn+O%29%29%29+Discography+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"372f089a8d7d14520688b3494a87746cd5988d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,47,8,154,141,125,20,82,6,136,179,73,74,135,116,108,213,152,141,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
