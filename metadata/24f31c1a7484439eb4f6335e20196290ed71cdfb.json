Frontman Art Alexakis says Invisible\n  Stars is a record that wanted to be made, as opposed to a record that I wanted\n  to make. This is a collection of songs that wouldn't leave me alone. They are\n  full of melody, big guitars, sarcasm, humor and a firm eye on the light at the\n  end of the tunnel, walking the line between sounding like a classic Everclear\n  album of the late 1990's and a contemporary rock record. This is a record I\n  have been waiting to make my whole life. The album boasts 12 exciting new\n  tracks, from album opener Tiger In A Burning tree, to Be Careful What You Ask\n  For to Santa Ana Wind through to the end with Promenade. Invisible Stars is a\n  thematic collection of songs from the perspective of someone who has ridden\n  the rollercoaster, and has got back in line. Everclear, like its charismatic\n  front man, has grown up a bit, and at the same time, Everclear (again, like\n  Art) refuses to grow up and play nice.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
