Throughout the world, such research is surprisingly extensive and expanding. BCI research is rapidly approaching a level of first-generation medical practice for use by individuals whose neural pathways are damaged, and use of BCI technologies is accelerating rapidly in nonmedical arenas of commerce as well, particularly in the gaming, automotive, and robotics industries. The technologies used for BCI purposes are cutting-edge, enabling, and synergistic in many interrelated arenas, including signal processing, neural tissue engineering, multiscale modeling, systems integration, and robotics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323ad946b5269a3d924c610a98f95fa243df49f5","amp;dn":"Brain-Computer+Interfaces+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323ad946b5269a3d924c610a98f95fa243df49f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,58,217,70,181,38,154,61,146,76,97,10,152,249,95,162,67,223,73,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
