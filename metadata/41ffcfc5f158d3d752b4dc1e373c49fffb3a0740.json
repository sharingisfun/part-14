The CD isn't in chronological order or even comprehensive enough to deem it a &quot;best of.&quot; That is not to say that this album doesn't contain some phenomenal recordings; it does. Bird features some of Parker's best, including &quot;Now's the Time,&quot; &quot;Blues for Alice,&quot; and &quot;K.C. Blues&quot; (the latter is a collaboration with Miles Davis). In addition to the 11 studio tracks, it also has a 12-minute live version of &quot;Lester Leaps In&quot; which features the tune's composer, Lester Young. Since most Charlie Parker fans will have these songs on other discs, they can probably skip this one. However, this is a decent place to start for those looking for an introduction to Parker or bebop.\n\nTracks:\n\n\n    1 - Now's The Time\n    2 - Laura\n    3 - Mohawk\n    4 - Kim\n    5 - Blues For Alice\n    6 - Laird Baird\n    7 - K.C.
