This, the second of three volumes covering Soviet secret aviation projects, is devoted to post-World War II fighters and will include designs from famous bureaus such as Lavochkin, Mikoyan, Sukhoi, Yakovlev, Myasishchev, and Tupolev. The book covers early post-war fighters, competitions for the first-generation supersonic designs (MiG-21 and Su-7/-9), advanced designs of the 1960s which led to the MiG-2 and competitions to build the specifications which resulted in the MiG-29, Su-27, and MiG I-44. A number of previously unpublished Yakovlev designs from the late 1950s and early 1960s form a separate chapter, followed by another covering Yakovlev's VSTOL work. The book also describes the competition between design bureaus for orders and shows the progress made in aircraft design behind the Iron Curtain. It will give both experts and enthusiasts the chance to compare this work to Western aircraft programs of the era.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Soviet-Secret-Projects-Fighters-Since/dp/1857802217&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Soviet-Secret-Projects-Fighters-Since/dp/1857802217&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506161d3e985657bc705a69857f69eb93e66e644","amp;dn":"Soviet+Secret+Projects%3A+Fighters+Since+1945","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506161d3e985657bc705a69857f69eb93e66e644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,97,97,211,233,133,101,123,199,5,166,152,87,246,158,185,62,102,230,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
