Wolfchant &quot;Bloody Tales of Disgraced Lands&quot;\n\nWolfchant is a new face in folk metal scene. These guys come from Germany and present here their debut album. There's a concept here telling about heathen country named Old Fields, which rises against their enemy Claim to get back their land that was stolen from them some years ago.\n\nMusically, they use lots of folk elements mixed with some black metal elements, which are shown mostly on vocal department, but also slightly in music. Also parts of the story are taken from Nordic mythology, which also has its effect on the sound. Sometimes they remind me of Finnish Ensiferum, which is nothing but a good thing, I sense no copycatting (if the mythology thing isn't concerned).\n\nAll in all, the Germans have created an interesting album, which is a pleasure to listen to. Fans of this kind of music will rush to the nearest store and get something nice.\n\n4/5[/quote]\n\nIf you like [i]Ensiferum[/i], [i]Mithotyn[/i] and [i]Equilibrium[/i] you should give this a try!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc4d8e12b4712868a0c72d024acd00b19ce66fce","amp;dn":"Wolfchant+-+2005+-+Bloody+Tales+Of+Disgraced+Lands","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc4d8e12b4712868a0c72d024acd00b19ce66fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,77,142,18,180,113,40,104,160,199,45,2,74,205,0,177,156,230,111,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
