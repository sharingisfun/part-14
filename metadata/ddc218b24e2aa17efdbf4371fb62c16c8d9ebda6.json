He starts his adventure in a fast boat crossing Cardigan Bay, which at 50-miles wide is the largest bay in Wales. He also explores Snowdonia, learns more about Britain's smallest bat, and searches for an eco-system hidden in the depths of the North Wales\r\n\r\n2)  Yorkshire Dales \r\nThe adventurer continues to explore the UK's natural history, abseiling at Malham Cove in the Yorkshire Dales and getting into danger in a flooding cave. Malham has long attracted tourists and geologists alike to wonder at its beauty and history, as well as walkers attracted to the limestone formation and its surrounding pathways, and Bear reveals a tropical past to one of North Yorkshire's finest features.\r\n\r\n3)  Scottish Highlands \r\nHe's trekked around Snowdonia in North Wales and explored the Yorkshire Dales - now Bear Grylls goes north of the border to the Scottish Highlands on an adventure that takes him from the deepest point in Britain to its highest mountain, Ben Nevis. Along the way he goes in search of freshwater pearl mussels, one of the most endangered species in the world, heads for the hills to discover how the country's magnificent highlands were formed and hears about a plan to save an ancient forest under threat because the native Scots pine has been over-run by a non-native species. He also discovers how reindeer are making a comeback and heads up the formidable Aonach Mor, a mountain more than 4,000ft tall with treacherous steep ice walls.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2e/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a2/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Britains-Biggest-Adventures-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3258 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.04 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddc218b24e2aa17efdbf4371fb62c16c8d9ebda6","amp;dn":"Britains+Biggest+Adventures+With+Bear+Grylls+Series+1+2of3+Yorks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddc218b24e2aa17efdbf4371fb62c16c8d9ebda6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,194,24,178,78,42,161,126,253,191,67,113,251,98,193,108,141,158,189,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
