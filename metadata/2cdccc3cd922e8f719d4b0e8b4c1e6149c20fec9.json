These opening words of Kurt\nVonnegut's famous novel make an effective and short summary of a haunting,\nfunny film. For the screen, director George Roy Hill faithfully renders\nVonnegut's black anti-war comedy about Pilgrim (well played in a low key\nby Michael Sacks), who survives the horrendous 1945 fire bombing of Dresden\nthen lives simultaneously in his past as a naÃƒÂ¯ve American POW and in the\nfuture as a well-cared-for zoo resident on the planet Tralfamadore (with\nzaftig Valerie Perrine as his mate). In the present, he's a middle-aged\noptometrist in Ilium, NY. If this sounds like a bit of a jumble -- it is.\nBut viewers willing to watch carefully will find the movie as intricate and\nharmonious as Glenn Gould's plaintive renderings of the Bach keyboard pieces\nthat decorate its soundtrack. It's not essential, but fans who read the\nshort, poetic book will find it a treat in itself, and it will help them\nappreciate Hill's genius in bringing this Children's Crusade to the\nscreen. In addition to Sacks, there are noteworthy performances by Ron\nLeibman (Norma's union man in Norma Rae) as Pilgrim's crazed nemesis andby\nradio/TV/movie legend, John Dehner as the arrogant Professor Rumfoord.\nHill, of course, came to this film from a big hit, Butch Cassidy and the\nSundance Kid, and went on to triumph with The Sting one year later. The\nelaborate medieval and baroque architecture of pre-bombing Dresden was\nrepresented authentically in the film by scenes from Prague, since much of\nDresden's architecture was lost to the bombing, and that city, in any\ncase, was deep in East Germany, thus inaccessible at the time of filming.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Michael Sacks.\n=&gt;-Ron Leibman.\n=&gt;-Eugene Roche.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-George Roy Hill.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre..........................: Comedy : Drama : Fantasy.\n=&gt;-Release Date...................: 1972.\n=&gt;-Language.......................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size......................: 1.35 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...............: 1 873 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..................: 1h 42mn.\n=&gt;-Slaughterhouse-Five............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/slaughterhouse_five/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...................: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.....................: 1280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate.......................: 1750 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels.......................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate.......................: 117 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...............: 139 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cdccc3cd922e8f719d4b0e8b4c1e6149c20fec9","amp;dn":"Slaughterhouse-Five+-+Comedy+Fantasy+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cdccc3cd922e8f719d4b0e8b4c1e6149c20fec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,220,204,60,217,34,232,247,25,212,176,232,180,193,230,20,156,32,254,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
