There is no sense of arriving, just the peace or the storm of being in the moment with the music, but finally both the land and the songs appear and you realize you have arrived somewhere.&quot;\n\nThe album was recorded in Heather's home on a small rocky island using only solar power. &quot;I wanted to make a big rock record, all about atmosphere and texture, so I went back to both the guitarist, David Ayers, and the producer (and my husband) Felix Tod, from many of the 'OysterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sessions . Geoff Dugmore, who played on Ã¢â‚¬ËœSirenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, played drums. It was pretty intense, but wonderful.&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ300 Days At SeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a rush to the head and a roar through the sea. Although she promises to be a soft, warm earth-mother, Nova is still demonstrating the steely siren-qualities of a time-proven rockstar. I, for one, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe for one minute that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather be on the ground than Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtravelling at the speed of light.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2f07b9097a35bcbd13d9fa25f7190549f1ec2d4","amp;dn":"Heather+Nova+-+300+Days+At+Sea+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2f07b9097a35bcbd13d9fa25f7190549f1ec2d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,240,123,144,151,163,91,203,209,61,159,162,95,113,144,84,159,30,194,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
