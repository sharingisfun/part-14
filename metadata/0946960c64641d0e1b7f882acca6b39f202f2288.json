King Arthur is ruling over the land. He is  a  great  and\n wise ruler. His subjects treat him with respect and  the  Knights  of  the\n Round Table remain steadfastly at his side.\n\n Arthurs  archenemies  have  joined  forces  with  the  Saxons   and   the\n Northerners and recruited a huge army. With it,  they  are  now  attacking\n Camelot. Arthur cannot stand at the sidelines and watch  everything  being\n destroyed, that he has built from the scratch. So he makes  one  last  and\n desperate attempt to prevent the inevitable. To make the attack a success,\n Arthur has to make the maximal sacrifice.\n\n Despite Arthurs effort  only  an  uncertain  stalemate  between  the  two\n rivaling parties can be accomplished, an elusive period of rest. The final\n battle is lying in remote future. But how did it come to that at all?\n\n Travel to a fantastic past and experience a new version  of  the  saga  of\n King Arthur. Witness the  most  important  events  in  the  story  of  the\n legendary king, until  his  selfless  attempt  to  save  his  kingdom  and\n accompany his loyal abiders on their way into an uncertain future. Can you\n restore the honor, the glory and the reign of Camelot?\n\n\n Features:\n =========\n\n * Experience medieval England at the time of King Arthur and\n   the Knights of the Round Table with detailed graphics and\n   painstakingly designed environments - and rewrite\n   history in the process!\n * Good or evil?
