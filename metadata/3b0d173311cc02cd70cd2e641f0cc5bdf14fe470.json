Upon taking out the trash you see Hank, Dale, Bill, and Boomhauer in the alley, and the simulation begins. There are several minigames that you can play. They include Mini-Golf, Lawnmower Race, Paintball, Scavenger Hunt, and Tic-Tac-Toss. You can also explore a limited part of the town. \n\nIn the beginning of Texas Huntin', you start out by getting a hunting license. You meet the guys, and they invite you to their hunt. The game is pretty dull, but has humorous moments, such as shooting Dale in the arm. \n\n\nI hope y'all enjoy this video game as much as I did :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b0d173311cc02cd70cd2e641f0cc5bdf14fe470","amp;dn":"King+Of+The+Hill+TV+Show+PC%2FMac+Video+Game+%28Best+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b0d173311cc02cd70cd2e641f0cc5bdf14fe470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,13,23,51,17,204,2,205,112,205,46,100,31,12,197,189,241,79,228,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
