Picture an old country road, flat land on either side and a whole lot of nothing out the window. The mood of the music - and Muth's narrative lyrics captures a stark honesty that recalls some of the finest country classics. In fact, there's so much spirit of Merle and Hank in these tunes (sung in an earnest tone reminiscent of Iris DeMent), it's easy to forget they were actually realized in the lush green of western Washington State.\n\ncd ripped by EAC \n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/09/zoe-muth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/09/zoe-muth/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe2d2f93d2ef6748f4b66bcf219ed26be28071d","amp;dn":"Zoe+Muth...Starlight+Hotel+%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe2d2f93d2ef6748f4b66bcf219ed26be28071d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,226,210,249,61,46,246,116,143,75,102,188,242,25,237,38,190,40,7,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
