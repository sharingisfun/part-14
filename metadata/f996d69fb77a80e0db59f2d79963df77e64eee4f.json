The title is taken from the lyrics of the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss the MiseryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Guest musicians include Bob Mould and Krist Novoselic. Compared with the 11-track regular version, the iTunes Deluxe Version includes 2 more audio tracks, 1 live performance video and the music video for the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhite LimoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. I also added the music video for the lead single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as well. Enjoy!\n\nProduced by Butch Vig and mixed by Alan Moulder, Wasting Light was recorded entirely on analog tape in the garage of Grohl s home in California s San Fernando Valley. The no computers/no software back to basics approach has resulted in arguably the strongest and most cohesive effort of the band s 15-year-plus career: From first single Rope to the frenetic opener Bridge Burning to the beautifully bipolar These Days to stunning guest spots from Bob Mould ( Dear RosemaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and Krist Novoselic (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½I Should Have KnownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), Wasting Light is a singular triumph: a band that s headlined arenas, stadiums and festivals the world over stripping itself down to the bare essentials and coming up with a world class band s finest hour.\n\n============================================\n\n\nAlbum Name: Foo Fighters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Wasting Light (Deluxe Version) [iTunes Version]\nGenre: Rock\nLabel: Roswell Records\nQuality: MPEG-4 AAC Audio 44100Hz 16Bits 256Kbps\nSize: 286.53MB\nRelease Year: 2011\n\n==============================================\n\n\n01.
