The original from The Only Ones is so much better and now I love them! So I went on and bought this CD which I couldn't find anywhere!\n\nThis album was released in 9 March 1979 but the last 2 extra songs that were added in this version(released in 2009) are composed in 2009!!!!\n\nSo if you have more from The Only Ones and can upload some more stuff(like a discography) drop me a message!\n\nIt's ripped in 320kbps OGG Vorbis.\n\nSupport Open Source \n\n&amp;\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19c1432751c78221a25945242d593272aa6db956","amp;dn":"The+Only+Ones+-+Even+Serpents+Shine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19c1432751c78221a25945242d593272aa6db956","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,193,67,39,81,199,130,33,162,89,69,36,45,89,50,114,170,109,185,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
