This is an all-consuming, soul-crushing, tear-your-heart-into-pieces story. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intense, gritty and raw, dark and disturbing, and it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happen overnight. This is an epic love story that knows no boundaries and has no time limits. It grows and developsÃ¢â‚¬â€with hurt, sacrifice, and heartacheÃ¢â‚¬â€over the span of a lifetime. \n\nEva Fox is the princess of the Silver Demons Motorcycle Club. Growing up with bikers in the club lifestyle is all that she knows. When sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a young girl, Eva meets the reason for her existence. Deuce West is the sexy, biker bad-ass of the HellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Horsemen Motorcycle Club. Like Eva, he was born and raised in the clubÃ¢â‚¬â€but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where the similarities end. Their first meeting is innocent, but as Eva matures into a woman, their chance reunions evolve into a fit of lust and love. Fate continues to bring them together time and time again, but their twisted journey is filled with pain, betrayal, and bloodshed that could tear them apart. Eva sees in Deuce what he cannot see in himselfÃ¢â‚¬â€a man worthy of loveÃ¢â‚¬â€and Eva spends her lifetime proving to him that her undeniable love is the one thing he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live without. \n\nThis is Eva and DeuceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story. \n\nIt wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy. \nNothing worth doing ever is.\nAnd love is worth everything. \n\nSeed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd69e928beeca141894e5736bbf8ef1f9ec85f27","amp;dn":"Undeniable+by+Madeline+Sheehan+%7BPDF%2C+EPUB%2C+MOBI%7D+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd69e928beeca141894e5736bbf8ef1f9ec85f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,105,233,40,190,236,161,65,137,78,87,54,187,248,239,31,158,200,95,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
