Ripped into Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format from the original CD.\n\nI strongly urge you to listen to this music in FLAC rather than MP3 format, since MP3's lose some of the sound quality that you would hear on the CD. By contrast, FLAC loses none of that qualityÃ¢â‚¬â€ that's why it's called a lossless format. MP3's are a lower-quality sound. FLAC sounds just like the CD. \n\nWhy listen to music that is coarser-sounding than it was intended to be? Especially if you are paying tuition to study that music\n\nSome samples (excerpts) of tracks from this disc set: http://www.allmusic.com/album/listen-7th-edition-6-cd-mw0002417053\n\nWindows Media Player, VLC media player, and many others play FLAC format. Songbird (http://getsongbird.com/desktop/) is a pretty good free program for organizing and playing your FLAC music library.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ae4b7ad3048c738387ec2529f88529a113cf2dc","amp;dn":"Listen%2C+7th+Edition%2C+CD+1+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ae4b7ad3048c738387ec2529f88529a113cf2dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,228,183,173,48,72,199,56,56,126,194,82,159,136,82,154,17,60,242,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
