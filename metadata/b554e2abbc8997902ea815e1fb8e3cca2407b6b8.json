Logically organised, lucidly presented and stylishly written, this is a first-class study that will enthrall all those interested in the history of Ireland in the modern period.&quot; Thomas Bartlett, University College Dublin\n\n&quot;In Dr. Jackson's book we have [a survey] of considerable breadth and flair... readers will find in it one of the most balanced and readable works on Irish political history to appear this decade.&quot; Marianne Elliott, University of Liverpool\n\n&quot;Alvin Jackson's Ireland 1798-1998 provides a well-informed and thought-provoking commentary on Irish history since the 1790s. The work shrewdly negotiates the differences between revisionist and anti-revisionist interpretations. Focussing mainly on the high politics of Irish nationalism and unionism, Jackson also illuminates the complexities of Anglo-Irish relations from the heyday of Wolfe Tone to the recent cycles of violence in Northern Ireland exercising moderation and balance throughout.&quot; L.P. Curtis, Brown University\n\n&quot;Alvin Jackson's Ireland 1798-1998 is a general history for the millenium: elegantly written, striving for a fierce impartiality, full of unexpected parallels and appositions.&quot; Roy Foster, New Statesman Books of the Year 1999\n\n&quot;Alvin Jackson offers an authoritative, reflective and refreshing analysis.&quot; Irish News\n\n&quot;Jackson presents a survey of modern Irish political history that is up-to-date and even-handed in its perspective ...

Jackson's gracefully written interpretations of events, forces and personalities are based upon an extensive reading of secondary sources and thoughtful, perceptive, and impartial judgements.&quot; Irish Studies Review\n\n&quot;Jackson' book cannot be bettered as the most up to date, comprehensive and readable account of the last 200 years.&quot; History Review\n\n&quot;A flowing narrative and sharp historical analysis ... Jackson is to be congratulated for producing a finely researched, well-written survey, which scholars, advanced under-graduates, and the general reader will find immensely informative and thought-provoking.&quot; Albion\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nWhen first published, Alvin Jackson's Ireland 1798-1998 received widespread critical acclaim for its analytical, sceptical and humane view of modern Irish history. JacksonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s re-evaluation of the field, exploration of the varieties of Irish political experience, and his particular attention to the (often highly productive) tension between nationalism and Unionism continue to stand as an impressive achievement.\nNow in its second edition, Ireland 1798-1998 has been updated to include coverage of the most recent political developments. It continues to offer readers an elegantly written, accessible and impartial interpretation of modern Irish political history, providing fresh and perceptive insights into some familiar issues and personalities of the period.\nJackson has provided a new epilogue to cover the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the restoration of devolution under the Paisley-McGuinness partnership, and the years of Bertie AhernÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political ascendancy. With an updated bibliography and chronology, Ireland 1798-1998 remains a highly stimulating and influential survey of 200 years of Irish history.\n\nAbout the Author\nAlvin Jackson is Richard Lodge Professor of History at the University of Edinburgh.
