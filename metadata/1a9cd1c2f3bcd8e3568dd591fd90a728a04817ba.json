This book is like looking through a window to the past, complete with Kbelwagen, Schwimmwagen, 20 mm Flak 38, Zundapp KS600, and Tatra OT-810 (Sd.Kfz 251). The photographs convey the effectiveness of the Camouflage uniforms, as well as the gloomy atmosphere experienced by the fighting men. Many authentic depictions of various activities are shown to great affect. This very interesting book is invaluable to scale modelers, figure painters, military enthusiasts, veterans, and historians","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a9cd1c2f3bcd8e3568dd591fd90a728a04817ba","amp;dn":"Warmachines+No.+16+-+German+Infantry+in+WWII","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a9cd1c2f3bcd8e3568dd591fd90a728a04817ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,156,209,194,243,188,216,227,86,141,213,145,253,144,167,40,160,72,23,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
