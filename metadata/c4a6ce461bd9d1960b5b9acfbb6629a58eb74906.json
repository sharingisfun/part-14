Ozin (Wiley-VCH, 2009).PDF\r\n\r\nAuthored by a rising star in the field and one of its pioneers, this textbook is ideal for interdisciplinary courses -- bridging chemistry, materials science, physics and biology. Adopting a completely new and visionary approach, this is a unique learning tool, focusing on just six concepts crucial for understanding nanochemistry: surface, size, shape, self-assembly, defects and the interface of biology and nanochemistry. These concepts are elucidated through the analysis of six materials representing the real life application of the nanochemistry concepts. The teaching questions included provide real &quot;food for thought,&quot; thus training students to think as a researcher does and so develop problem-solving skills","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4a6ce461bd9d1960b5b9acfbb6629a58eb74906","amp;dn":"Concepts+of+Nanochemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4a6ce461bd9d1960b5b9acfbb6629a58eb74906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,166,206,70,27,217,209,150,11,91,154,207,187,102,41,165,142,183,73,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
