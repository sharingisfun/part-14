The collection, with its satirical, skeptical tone, is widely considered one of Ellison's best. The book includes a 1973 introduction and a stern caveat lector page advising the reader against enjoying the volume in one sitting. The title of the book comes from &quot;The Deathbird&quot;, the nineteenth and last story in the collection.&quot;\n\nBluejay Books 1983 edition.
