Rather than returning SorayaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dowry, as custom required before taking a second wife, he plotted with four friends and a counterfeit mullah to dispose of her. Together, they accused Soraya of adultery. Her only crime was cooking for a friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widowed husband. Exhausted by a lifetime of abuse and hardship, Soraya said nothing, and the makeshift tribunal took her silence as a confession of guilt. They sentenced her to death by stoning: a punishment prohibited by Islam but widely practiced.\n\nDay by dayÃ¢â‚¬â€sometimes minute by minuteÃ¢â‚¬â€Sahebjam deftly recounts these horrendous events, tracing SorayaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life with searing immediacy, from her arranged marriage and the births of her children to her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increasing cruelty and her horrifying execution, where, by tradition, her father, husband, and sons hurled the first stones. A stark look at the intersection between culture and justice, this is one womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, but it stands for the stories of thousands of women who sufferedÃ¢â‚¬â€and continue to sufferÃ¢â‚¬â€the same fate. It is a story that must be told.\n\n**\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Starred Review. An unforgettable indictment, brilliantly written and translated, of manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inhumanity to womanÃ¢â‚¬â€and of tyranny disguised as righteousness.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Kirkus Reviews)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Starred Review. Profoundly disturbing. . . . highly recommended.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Library Journal)\n\nAbout the Author\n\nFreidoune Sahebjam, the son of a former Iranian ambassador, is a journalist who was sentenced to death in absentia for his undercover reporting criticizing the Iranian government.
