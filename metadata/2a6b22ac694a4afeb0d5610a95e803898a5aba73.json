Sienkewicz &quot;Ancient Greece, Vol. 3&quot;\nSalem Press | 2006-08-22 | ISBN: 1587652811 | 1076 pages | PDF\n\n\nGrade 9 UpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½This authoritative and accessible reference tool is a comprehensive examination of Greek civilization and its impact on Western history, &quot;from its earliest archaeological remains until the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C.E.&quot; The alphabetically arranged volumes are composed of 315 informative and engaging essays that range from one to eight pages in length. They cover art, daily life and customs, government, literature, medicine and science, war, the role of women, and mythology. Biographical entries profile statesmen, artists, writers, scientists, and philosophers, and relevant entries probe battles, philosophical movements, and types of literature. The material has been culled and updated from six other Salem Press sets: Great Events from History: The Ancient World, Prehistory-476 C.E. (2004); Great Lives from History: The Ancient World, Prehistory-476 C.E. (2004); Cyclopedia of World Authors (2004); Encyclopedia of the Ancient World (2002); Weapons and Warfare (2002); and Magill's Guide to Military History (2001). \n\nTwenty-nine new essays have been added, and the bibliographies have been revised. The user-friendly articles include thoughtful subheadings, see-also references, and a list of up-to-date further-reading resources. Each volume has a pronunciation guide, and volume three includes an annotated list of historic sites. Lucid black-and-white photos, tables, maps, and sidebars enhance this excellent presentation. David Sacks and Lisa Brody's Encyclopedia of the Ancient Greek World (Facts On File, 2005) is also broad in scope, but is geared toward an older audience.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Hillary Jan Donitz-Goldstein, formerly at New York Public Librar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6b22ac694a4afeb0d5610a95e803898a5aba73","amp;dn":"Ancient+Greece%2C+Vol++3+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6b22ac694a4afeb0d5610a95e803898a5aba73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,107,34,172,105,74,74,254,176,213,97,10,149,232,3,137,138,90,186,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
