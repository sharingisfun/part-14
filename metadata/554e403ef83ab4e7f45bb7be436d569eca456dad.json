In Maguire&amp;#039;s Oz, Elphaba, better known as the Wicked Witch of the West, is not wicked; nor is she a formally schooled witch. Instead, she&amp;#039;s an insecure, unfortunately green Munchkinlander who&amp;#039;s willing to take radical steps to unseat the tyrannical Wizard of Oz. Using an appropriately brusque voice for the always blunt Elphaba, McDonough relates her tumultuous childhood (spent with an alcoholic mother and a minister father) and eye-opening school years (when she befriends her roommate, Glinda). McDonough&amp;#039;s pacing remains frustratingly slow even after the plot picks up, and Elphaba&amp;#039;s protracted ruminations on the nature of evil will have some listeners longing for an abridgement. Still, McDonough&amp;#039;s excellent portrayals of Elphaba&amp;#039;s outspoken, gravel-voiced nanny, Glinda&amp;#039;s snobbish friends and the wide-eyed, soft-spoken Dorothy make this excursion to Oz worthwhile.\nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
