Contescu, Karol Putyera (CRC, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-8493-9639-7\r\n\r\nWith its original publication, the Dekker Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology immediately became the reference against which all other nano references are measured. Noting that the encyclopedia was being assembled by leading authorities at an early stage in the fieldâ€™s development, Sir Harry Kroto, 1996 Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry, rightfully predicted that the encyclopedia would bring together key advances in a â€œcoherently organized framework.â€ Continuing to cover the field as no other resource, the six-volume second edition crosses disciplines to examine fundamental nano principles, theories, and methodologies, as well as the latest information on nano-relevant properties. It also covers advances in nanoscale engineering, newly developed simulation tools, and emerging computational methods.\r\n\r\nAmong other accolades, this million-dollar bestseller has gone on to win an Outstanding Academic Book Award from CHOICE magazine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baea5f470e093124e1b3d6ff55ee4dd2b8ad6490","amp;dn":"Dekker+Encyclopedia+of+Nanoscience+and+Nanotechnology+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baea5f470e093124e1b3d6ff55ee4dd2b8ad6490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,234,95,71,14,9,49,36,225,179,214,255,85,238,77,210,184,173,100,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
