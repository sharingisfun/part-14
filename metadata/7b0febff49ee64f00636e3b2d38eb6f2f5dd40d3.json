Enter the Deep Dungeons of Doom if you dareÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThis game is only for the brave. Dungeons await, each one deeper, each one more perilous and each one more challenging than the last.\n\nYou will meet monsters and you will need skill and tactics to defeat them. You will find weird and wonderful treasures along the way. Most will help you, but some might not. \n\nYou may choose to play as a Crusader, a Witch or a Mercenary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in fact each one might well be required if you are to successfully complete your quest Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but knowing when to use each one is something you are going to have to figure out for yourself.\n\nThe reward for your endeavours? The Deepest Dungeon of Doom. Never before has such evil existed on such a massive scale. Only the most battle-hardened rogues will stand a chance of making an impact.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- All of the in-app purchases are no more - you can no longer buy gold (you have to earn it!) and revive tokens are only accessible when you complete one of the secret endings.\n- WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve completely rebalanced the items in the shop including prices and first 5 dungeons.\n- YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to play through all of the dungeons without hitting a paywall. Now NOTHING will stop you from reaching the Deepest Dungeon of Doom.\n- WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also fixed a few pesky bugs that were hanging around.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bossastudios.ddd.paid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bossastudios.ddd.paid&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b0febff49ee64f00636e3b2d38eb6f2f5dd40d3","amp;dn":"Deep+Dungeons+of+Doom+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b0febff49ee64f00636e3b2d38eb6f2f5dd40d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,15,235,255,73,238,100,240,6,54,227,178,211,142,182,242,245,221,64,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
