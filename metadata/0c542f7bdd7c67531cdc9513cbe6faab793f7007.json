After a lifetime, her only real accomplishment is her longevity: everyone she reads about in the obituaries has died younger than she is now. Afraid that her life will be over before anyone knows that she lived, Mathea digs out her old wedding dress, bakes some sweet cakes, and heads out into the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€to make her mark. She buries a time capsule out in the yard. (It gets dug up to make room for a flagpole.) She wears her late husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s watch and hopes people will ask her for the time. (They never do.) Is it really possible for a woman to disappear so completely that the world wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t notice her passing? The Faster I Walk, the Smaller I Am is a macabre twist on the notion that life Ã¢â‚¬Å“must be lived to the fullest.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c542f7bdd7c67531cdc9513cbe6faab793f7007","amp;dn":"The+Faster+I+Walk%2C+The+Smaller+I+Am+%28Norwegian+Literature+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c542f7bdd7c67531cdc9513cbe6faab793f7007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,84,47,123,221,124,103,83,28,220,149,19,203,230,250,171,121,63,112,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
