Meanwhile, as the Battle of Britain got underway, inexperienced British pilots were paying a heavy cost.\n\nBelatedly, the Poles were cleared for active service and had an immediate impact. In their first week they shot down 40 enemy aircraft, making them the highest scoring RAF squadron. By the time the Battle of Britain was won, they had claimed 126 enemy planes. But as the war ended, their joy turned to despair as they saw their own country handed to Stalin.\n\nCh4 Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-untold-battle-of-britain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-untold-battle-of-britain&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 49mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.50 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid and SRT available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b34378267bf23ee36ce7db72d6f7fa75272efa69","amp;dn":"Ch4+The+Untold+Battle+of+Britain+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b34378267bf23ee36ce7db72d6f7fa75272efa69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,67,120,38,123,242,62,227,108,231,219,114,214,247,250,117,39,46,250,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
