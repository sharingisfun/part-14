Learn about IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gaelic roots with a visit to the small village of Rath Cairn in County Meath, one of the few places recognized as an official Gaelic area, where residents have made a living teaching others about the Irish language, its music and traditions. Also get a stunning insight into the remarkable island economy of Ireland, which has progressed from one of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poorest to one with the second largest GNP per capita in Europe. It begins in Dublin and then explores IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s canal system, the rock of Cashel, the historic village of Colonel and, of course, the ubiquitous Irish pub. Finally, we experience the last day of races in the coastal village of Tramore and visit the famous stud farms of County Clare. CELTIC VOYAGE takes viewers through the past and present of Ireland, by exploring famed sites such as the passage tombs of Knowth and Dowth and the famous megalithic mound at Newgrange. Learn about IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deep connection to the sea with a visit to the Moy River in Ballina, County Mayo, one of the most famous salmon and sea trout rivers in Ireland, and explore ancient castles like the Blarney Castle, home of the famous Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blarney Stone.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69a3abab75055d2f5239d5b091c88585d2b114e9","amp;dn":"Celtic+Voyage+-+A+Fascinating+Voyage+Through+Ireland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69a3abab75055d2f5239d5b091c88585d2b114e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,163,171,171,117,5,93,47,82,57,213,176,145,200,133,133,210,177,20,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
