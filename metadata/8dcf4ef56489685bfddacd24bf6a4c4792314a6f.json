In this revealing and powerfully argued book, author Franck Frommer shows us that PowerPointÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrated ease and efficiency actually mask a profoundly disturbing but little-understood transformation in human communication.\n\n\n Using fascinating examples (including the most famous PowerPoint presentation of all: Colin PowellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s indictment of Iraq before the United Nations), Frommer systematically deconstructs the slides, bulleted lists, and flashy graphics we all now take for granted. He shows how PowerPoint has promoted a new, slippery Ã¢â‚¬Å“grammar,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where faulty causality, sloppy logic, decontextualized data, and seductive showmanship have replaced the traditional tools of persuasion and argument.\n\n How PowerPoint Makes You Stupid includes a fascinating mini-history of PowerPointÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emergence, as well as a sobering and surprising account of its reach into the most unsuspecting nooks of work, life, and education. For anyone concerned with the corruption of language, the dumbing-down of society, or the unchecked expansion of Ã¢â‚¬Å“efficiencyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in our culture, here is a book that will become a rallying cry for turning the tide.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dcf4ef56489685bfddacd24bf6a4c4792314a6f","amp;dn":"How+PowerPoint+Makes+You+Stupid+2012+%28Epub%29+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dcf4ef56489685bfddacd24bf6a4c4792314a6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,207,78,245,100,137,104,91,253,218,205,36,191,106,76,71,146,49,74,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
