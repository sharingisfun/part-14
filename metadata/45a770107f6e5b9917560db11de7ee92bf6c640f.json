J. Enright revised the late Terence KilmartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acclaimed reworkings of C. K. Scott MoncrieffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and Andreas MayorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s translations to match the definitive French editions published in recent decades. Expertly and lovingly crafted to rival Marcel ProustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original in elegance, precision, and emotional resonance, here is In Search of Lost Time as it was meant to be read.\n\nFollow me @livhre\n\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload.

To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.\n\nSupport Amas school of technology.
