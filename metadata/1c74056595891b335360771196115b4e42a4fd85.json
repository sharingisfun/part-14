The event was the culmination of three years of work by artists of 19 nationalities.  The star of the concert was Sarah Vaughan, one of the truly great singers of the twentieth Century.  She sang a cycle of songs based on poems written years earlier by a young Polish priest named Karol Wojtyla, who would become the first non-Italian Pope in four centuries and take the name John Paul II.  This recording contains one of Miss Vaughan&amp;#039;s finest works, a soaring and inspired performance accompanied by a chorus and orchestra of 70 that includes Art Farmer, Benny Baily and Edmund Thigpen.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c74056595891b335360771196115b4e42a4fd85","amp;dn":"SARAH+VAUGHAN+-+Dejavu+Retro+Gold+Collection+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c74056595891b335360771196115b4e42a4fd85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,116,5,101,149,137,27,51,83,96,119,17,150,17,91,78,66,164,253,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
