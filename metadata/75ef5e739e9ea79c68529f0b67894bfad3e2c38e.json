First colonised by the Spanish, in 1636 it was occupied by the Netherlands which it still belongs to today.\r\n\r\nExactly 300 years later, the first airport was built by the Dutch. It served as a hub for American forces in the Second World War, which it was too small for, though. Therefore, a new airport was constructed â€“ â€œFlamingo Airportâ€ was born. Today, this airport operates several short-haul flights across the Caribbean, and serves as a stopover for the Dutch KLM on long-haul flights.\r\n\r\nThis scenery offers a highly detailed recreation of Flamingo International Airport (BON / TNCB) near the city of Kralendijk on Bonaire. The developer took thousands of photos at the location and used those to create the accurate building models and high-resolution textures. Custom lights even at night, animated palm trees and static aircraft bring this airport to a virtual life. Thanks to latest technology, optimal visuals and performance are possible.\r\n\r\nSo, pack your surfboard and visit Bonaire!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ef5e739e9ea79c68529f0b67894bfad3e2c38e","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+Aerosoft+Bonaire+Airport+1.02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75ef5e739e9ea79c68529f0b67894bfad3e2c38e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,239,94,115,158,158,167,156,104,82,159,11,103,137,75,250,211,226,195,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
