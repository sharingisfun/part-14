That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n\nsome thumbnails covers for not good reason son I can't show them inline like at other sites\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img263.imageshack.us/img263/6772/mtcdcnmc16.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img263.imageshack.us/img263/6772/mtcdcnmc16.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis is where I usually says something but not today.

The english version of this published by DC has not been scanned. \nPossibly you can read Dutch. But most of you can't.\nThose of you can't read Dutch can at least see the art work. If you like it you can possibly buy a used copy of the english version. Search your local internet.\nIf you do speak Dutch and English perhaps you'd like to translate the text - then you or someone else could replace the Dutch text. These comics are ideal for that since all the text is in plain white boxes. Easy to clear and retype.\nNow if you really want a project, but do not speak Dutch, you could type each bit of text into Google Translate, and then take the mangled english that comes out and work it into something sensible. Using clues from the rest of the story and the art you could probably make a very good english version that way. I am almost tempted just for the quirkiness of it. It would be like solving a puzzle. But I'm way too lazy.\n\nElectric Warrior 01-18 (1986-1987)\n\nElfQuest -  DC only did a bit of reprints of this, much of which are not scanned, since the originals have been.
