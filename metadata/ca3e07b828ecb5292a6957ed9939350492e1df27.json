Taking the working mans approach,\nGhostland Observatory spend countless hours in their south Austin studio.\nThey have released two albums in less than a year, and have moved audiences\nfrom coast to coast with their live performances and unique style.\nGhostland Observatory is the duo of front man Aaron Behrens and producer/\ndrummer Thomas Turner. Behrens vocal style and stage performances\nare unique and uncompromising, and he has drawn early comparisons\nto Freddie Mercury and Prince. Turner is heavily influenced by\nelectronic artists such as Daft Punk, Laurent Garnier and Green Velvet, as\nwell as rockers such as The Animals, David Bowie, and The Clash. With\ntheir spectral blend of electronics, drums, guitar and vocals, they have\nemerged with a sound that is the culmination of past influence and present\ninspiration, and can only be described as BALLSY.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca3e07b828ecb5292a6957ed9939350492e1df27","amp;dn":"Ghostland+Observatory+-+2006+-+Paparazzi+Lightning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca3e07b828ecb5292a6957ed9939350492e1df27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,62,7,184,40,236,181,41,42,105,87,237,153,57,53,4,146,225,223,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
