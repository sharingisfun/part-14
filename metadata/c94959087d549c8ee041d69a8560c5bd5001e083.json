It was during my stay at home that I met Marlboro Man, a mysterious cowboy with steely blue eyes and a muscular, work-honed body. A strict vegetarian, I fell hard and fast, and before I knew it we were married and living on his ranch in the middle of nowhere, taking care of animals, and managing a brood of four young children. I had no idea how I'd wound up there, but I knew it was exactly where I belonged.\n\nThe Pioneer Woman Cooks is a homespun collection of photography, rural stories, and scrumptious recipes that have defined my experience in the country. I share many of the delicious cowboy-tested recipes I've learned to make during my years as an accidental ranch wifeÃ¢â‚¬â€including Rib-Eye Steak with Whiskey Cream Sauce, Lasagna, Fried Chicken, Patsy's Blackberry Cobbler, and Cinnamon RollsÃ¢â‚¬â€not to mention several &quot;cowgirl-friendly&quot; dishes, such as Sherried Tomato Soup, Olive Cheese Bread, and CrÃƒÂ¨me BrÃƒÂ»lÃƒÂ©e. I show my recipes in full color, step-by-step detail, so it's as easy as pie to follow along.\n\nYou'll also find colorful images of rural life: cows, horses, country kids, and plenty of chaps-wearing cowboys.\n\nI hope you get a kick out of this book of mine. I hope it makes you smile. I hope the recipes bring you recognition, accolades, and marriage proposals. And I hope it encourages even the most harried urban cook to slow down, relish the joys of family, nature, and great food, and enjoy life.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRee Drummond is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Pioneer Woman Cooks.
