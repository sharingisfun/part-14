For other versions, if you want to activate,\nand do not have a key, you will need to install the gVLK.\n-I recommend inserting the gVLK during boot setup if you\nplan to activate via KMS. It will change the channel to\nVolume. It's not required, but it will give you a bogus\nRetail channel if you don't.\n-THERE IS A SKIP BUTTON ON THE BOOT SETUP FOR KEY ENTRY. DO\nNOT COMPLAIN ABOUT ENTERING A KEY. PRESS SKIP!\n\nNotes:\n-Upgrade files have been removed in this version of Win10.\n-Upgrades fail on previous Windows versions if you don't\nuse a very specific install format.\n-As this is a 6in1, a small single-index esd file or wim\nfile is not going to happen.\n\nCredits:\nCODYQX4 - Microsoft Toolkit KMS Activator\nmurphy78 - Integration, ISO design and testing\n\nEnjoy,\nmurphy78 :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a2a96c83416009b93264db1f3943b778bdfe1af","amp;dn":"Windows+10+6in1+10240+x32+en-US+Aug2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a2a96c83416009b93264db1f3943b778bdfe1af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,42,150,200,52,22,0,155,147,38,77,177,243,148,59,119,139,223,225,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
