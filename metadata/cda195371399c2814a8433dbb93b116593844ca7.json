It fits him well. Aside from a rare embellishment in a fade-out chorus, Croce's voice was as musically laconic as it was restlessly verbal. So, while forever mawkish in his writings, the restraint of his style just manages to hover over a slough of complete sentimentality.&quot; ***\n- Bart Testa, Rolling Stone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda195371399c2814a8433dbb93b116593844ca7","amp;dn":"Jim+Croce+-+Life+and+Times+%281973+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda195371399c2814a8433dbb93b116593844ca7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,161,149,55,19,153,194,129,74,132,51,219,185,59,17,101,147,132,76,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
