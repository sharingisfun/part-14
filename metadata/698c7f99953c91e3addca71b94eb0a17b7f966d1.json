To some, his concept of 'good eating' might seem a bit skewed - he'd always bypass a McBurger in favour of a squirrel sandwich, and make a detour for fresh road kill - but to others he is a shining and shaggy beacon of good sense in a food world gone mad. \n\nArmed with a broad mind, a quick wit and a ready appetite, Hugh covers almost every area of global food culture. \n\nWhether singing the praises of offal; debunking Colonel Sanders and Dr. Atkins; playing 'poisson roulette' with the deadly fugu fish in Tokyo; pondering the moral inconsistency of those who condemn fox hunting for its cruelty while happily tucking into factory-farmed chicken; fishing for marlin in Kenya, trout in Chile and barracuda in the Bahamas; analysing the tea-dunking qualities of some classic British biscuits; contemplating why if piglets are destined for the pot, why aren't puppies; or reminding us that a reindeer isn't just for Christmas, but tasty all year round, Hugh has an unerring ability to entertain and provoke.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Cookery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:698c7f99953c91e3addca71b94eb0a17b7f966d1","amp;dn":"Hugh+Fearlessly+Eats+by+Hugh+Fearnley-Whittingstall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"698c7f99953c91e3addca71b94eb0a17b7f966d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,140,127,153,149,60,145,227,173,220,167,27,148,235,10,23,183,249,102,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
