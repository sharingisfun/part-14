There are moments on Aerial Boundaries where it \nseems literally impossible that so much music is coming from one man \nand his guitar. Attacking his instrument, snapping strings, banging on \nthe fingerboard with his right hand, Hedges plays supremely beautiful \nmusic with the technique of a deranged lunatic. It has been said that \ngenius is at least one part madness ? although a questionable \nassertion in general terms ? when applied to Hedges and his music, \nthe analogy holds. The songs on Aerial Boundaries are all beautiful and \nhaunting in their own right; and it is this emphasis on composition over \ntechnique that makes this such an important recording. Hedges \nmakes the breadth of his musical interest known by the inclusion of \nthe extremely interesting electronic piece, &quot;Spare Change.&quot; Even \nthough the liner notes assure the listener that the guitar is the origin \nfor every sound heard, Hedges has electronically manipulated some of \nthem to an almost unrecognizable point, yet he has still managed to \ncreate music of untarnished beauty. There is something of the music \nof minimalist Steve Reich&amp;#039;s (thanked in the liner notes) in this track, as \nthe cycling, overlapping guitar tracks are almost trance-like in their \nrepetitiveness, yet utterly musical in their constant revelations. Aerial \nBoundaries is simply one of the finest acoustic guitar albums ever \nmade, and deserves a place in the library of all serious music fans. \n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.17 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15bb4308349ec85b8558e97d264561cdb5ccda5f","amp;dn":"Michael+Hedges+-+1985+-+Aerial+Boundaries+-+newage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15bb4308349ec85b8558e97d264561cdb5ccda5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,187,67,8,52,158,200,91,133,88,233,125,38,69,97,205,181,204,218,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
