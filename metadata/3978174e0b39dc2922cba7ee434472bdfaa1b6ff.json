The other dysfunctional lunatics on the block - and his monster crush on the cute girl at school (Reese Witherspoon) - don't make things any easier for Jack. But when a family crisis hits, will Jack's dad be able to lift the grownup burden from his young son's shoulders? Oscar nominee Gary Sinise and Seinfelds's Julia Louis-Dreyfus co-star in this funny, bittersweet look at the joys and pains of growing up.\n\n~~~ ENGLISH AUDIO, ENGLISH &amp; SPANISH SUBS ~~~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3978174e0b39dc2922cba7ee434472bdfaa1b6ff","amp;dn":"Jack.the.Bear.DVDRip.WS.English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3978174e0b39dc2922cba7ee434472bdfaa1b6ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,120,23,78,11,57,220,41,34,203,167,238,67,68,114,189,250,161,182,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
