In the past Greek photographers have become victims to police brutality quite often, and Marios himself barely got out alive out of one these extreme and undemocratical attacks. When KREATOR showed Marios both song and lyrics, he immediately agreed participate by offering parts of his huge photographic archives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56d9f667e6ccb59c2563b0b64faa2501c44709ae","amp;dn":"Kreator+-+Civilization+Collapse+%282012%29+%5Bmp3%40256%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56d9f667e6ccb59c2563b0b64faa2501c44709ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,217,246,103,230,204,181,156,37,99,176,182,79,170,37,1,196,71,9,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
