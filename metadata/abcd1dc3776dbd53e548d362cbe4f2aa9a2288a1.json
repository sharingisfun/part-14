He then uses the equipment to do serious damage to an urban plaza, tearing a strip right down the middle of a central road and toward the sea. When the ditch hits the ocean, it fills up with water and government personnel mistakenly believe that the series of actions has been authorized by the state - ignoring the protests of people who indicate otherwise.\n\n\nDVDRIP\n\nLanguage: Hebrew\nSrt Subtitles: English, Hebrew, Bulgarian, French, Portuguese.\n\n\nRunning Time: 1:31:44\nIndex Chunk: Yes\nInterleaved: Yes\nMax Bytes Per Sec: 0\n\nAUDIO: 0 - MP3 (0x55)\nAverage Bitrate Per Sec: 128 kb/s\nSamples Rate: 48000 Hz\nChannels: 2\nBits Per Sample: 0\nSuggestedBufferSize: 8064\nSample Size: 384\nVariable Bitrate: No\n\nVIDEO: XVID\nB-VOP: Yes\nS(GMC)-VOP: No\nQuarterPixel: No\nFrame Size: 512 x 384\nFrames Rate: 25.000\nColor Depth: 12\nTotal Frames: 137601\nSuggestedBufferSize: 56921","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abcd1dc3776dbd53e548d362cbe4f2aa9a2288a1","amp;dn":"Te%5C%27alat+Blaumilch+%281969%29+aka+The+Big+Dig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abcd1dc3776dbd53e548d362cbe4f2aa9a2288a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,205,29,195,119,109,189,83,229,72,211,98,203,228,242,170,154,34,136,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
