A year later, still no trace of the planeÃ¢â‚¬â€or the 239 people on boardÃ¢â‚¬â€has been found. But why? In Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Plane That Wasn't There,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ science journalist and CNN Aviation Analyst Jeff Wise sweeps aside the conspiracy theories and misconceptions and lays out with clear concision just what we know about the planeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fateÃ¢â‚¬â€and what we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. The deeper into the technical details one delves, Wise reports, the stranger the case seems. He proposes that in order to make sense of the data we have, a radical new hypothesis ought to be consideredÃ¢â‚¬â€one which he lays out in gripping detail, complete with modus operandi, flight path, possible perpetrators, and a startling destination.\n\nJeff Wise a science journalist specializing in aviation and psychology. A licensed pilot of gliders and light airplanes, he has also written for New York, the New York Times, Time, Businessweek, Esquire, Details, and many others.
