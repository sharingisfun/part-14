This book describes the design, manufacture and applications of textile composites.\n\nThe intention is to describe the broad range of polymer composite materials with textile reinforcements, from woven and non-crimp commodity fabrics to 3-D textiles and their applications. The book gives particular attention to the modelling of textile structures, composites manufacturing methods, and subsequent component performance. This practical book is an invaluable guide for manufacturers of polymer composite components, end-users and designers, structural materials researchers, and textile manufacturers involved in the development of new products with textile composites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:127bdd90fd68d374cdda54961795b4b3447f1eda","amp;dn":"Design+and+Manufacture+of+Textile+Composites","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"127bdd90fd68d374cdda54961795b4b3447f1eda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,123,221,144,253,104,211,116,205,218,84,150,23,149,180,179,68,127,30,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
