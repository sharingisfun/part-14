Mazer recalls that the sessions grew ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtenseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, as Gallagher wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t happy with the mixing process, describing them as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtoo complicatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and by the end of January 1978 he shelved the whole record and broke up his band of the past 5 years.\n\nFast forward to 2010 and RoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brother and manager, DÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â±nal, allowed his son &amp; RoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nephew, Daniel, to recover the album from the Gallagher archive and begin the process of mixing it with his engineer. Rory said in 1992 he hoped the album would surface one day but only if it were remixed and now we finally get to hear this never before issued studio album from a key period of GallagherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career, an album that would have been released between ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Calling CardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Photo FinishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. This is truly a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Holy GrailÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ release for RoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fans.\n\nCD 2 is also another fabulous discovery, a blistering live album taken from four nights at The Old Waldorf, San Francisco December 1979. In the audience Van Morrison, on stage Rory Gallagher (guitar/vocals), Gerry McAvoy (bass) and Ted McKenna (drums).\n\nDaniel Gallagher chose to add the live side to highlight why Rory chose to shelve the studio album and reduce his band back down to a three piece. As Rory often said he wanted to get back to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“meat and potatoes rock &amp; rollÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. \n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1 (Studio)\n\n01. Rue The Day\n02. Persuasion\n03. B Girl\n04.
