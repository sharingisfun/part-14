Good thing Kate Daniels is on the job.\n\nKate Daniels may have quit the Order of Knights of Merciful Aid, but she's still knee-deep in paranormal problems. Or she would be if she could get someone to hire her. Starting her own business has been more challenging than she thought it would be-now that the Order is disparaging her good name. Plus, many potential clients are afraid of getting on the bad side of the Beast Lord, who just happens to be Kate's mate.\n\nSo when Atlanta's premier Master of the Dead calls to ask for help with a vampire on the loose, Kate leaps at the chance of some paying work. But it turns out that this is not an isolated incident. Kate needs to get to the bottom of it-and fast, or the city and everyone dear to her may pay the ultimate price...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fadea2395bb1e225fe1208831d634ee0a1b1ed7c","amp;dn":"Ilona+Andrews+-+Kate+Daniels+05+-+Magic+Slays","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fadea2395bb1e225fe1208831d634ee0a1b1ed7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,222,162,57,91,177,226,37,254,18,8,131,29,99,78,224,161,177,237,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
