Blue Planet included.\nSCP 3.7.0 offers new graphical features, less bugs, and greater stability.\n\nUNPACK WITH WINRAR INTO YOUR GAMES FOLDER.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Open up FS2 wxlauncher. Go to &quot;Basic Settings&quot; and find your Freespace 2 folder. Select &quot;fs2_open_3_7_0_RC2&quot; to play Freespace 2 and other mods, or &quot;fs2_open_3_6_19_SSE2_BP&quot; SPECIFICALLY if you want to play Blue Planet.\n\n2. Go to Mods tab, and select mod \n\n&quot;3.6.12 Media_VP&quot; to play Freespace 2 with upgraded graphics.\nFSPort-MediaVP to play Freespace 1 with upgraded graphics and soundtrack.\nFSPort-STR is an expansion to Freespace 1.\nBlue Planet/Blue Planet 2 to play the great community created campaign which feels like Freespace 3. \nJAD is another good (parody) mod to play for laughs.\n\n3. Make sure your Video, Audio, and Joystick settings are what you want them to be. You can also customize Text-to-speech settings.\n\n4. Go to Advanced Settings tab. Enable the following...\n\nIn Graphics:\nApply Lighting to missiles\nEnable 3D Shockwaves\nEnable Post Processing\nEnable Soft Particles\nEnable FXAA\n\nIn HUD:\nAdd another pair of scanning lines\nEnable info next to target\nEnable 3D Radar\nEnable rearm/repair completion timer\nEnable analog ballistic ammo gauge\n\nIn Gameplay:\nUse 3D Models for ship selection\nUse 3D Models for weapons selection\nEnable 3D Warp\nEnable Flash upon warp\n\nIn Experimental:\nEnable Framebuffer Shockwaves\n\n*disable the framebuffer shockwaves if you're having crash problems\n\nSELECT &quot;BASELINE RECOMMENDED&quot; UNDER LIGHTING PRESETS (on the right side).\nThis will provide overall improved lighting options.\n\n5. Launch Game. Create a new pilot and type in a callsign.\n\n6.Go to Options ingame, and turn all the graphics to maximum. Turn up the mouse sensitivity to maximum. You can customize your flight controls, as well as your HUD to your liking (recommended).\n\nFor controls, I recommend binding these keys:\nW for Acceleration\nS for Deceleration\nA for Bank Left\nD for Bank Right\nSpace for Afterburner\nMouse Right Click for Launch Missles\nMouse Left Click for Primary weapons\nMouse Middle Click for Switch weapons\n\n7. Go to Campaigns and make sure the Campaign you want to play is loaded. For Blue Planet, play Age of Aquarius first, War in Heaven Part 1 as second, and War in Heaven Part 2 last. There are bonus campaigns for some mods. &quot;Kill Everything&quot; campaign can be ignored (it was my own creation).\n\n8. Don't forget to seed this great game!\nThanks! \n\nENJOY!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1dc8c837212bc32d0442e113b2df706530095e6","amp;dn":"Freespace+2+SCP+3.7.0+%2B+Blue+Planet+AoA+%26amp%3B+WiH+%5BREPACK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1dc8c837212bc32d0442e113b2df706530095e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,220,140,131,114,18,188,50,208,68,46,17,59,45,247,6,83,0,149,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
