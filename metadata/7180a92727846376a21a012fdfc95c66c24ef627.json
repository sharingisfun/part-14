Beginning with\ntheir third disc, &quot;Seasons Of Love,&quot; and in order to have a sound more amiable for live performances\nsince they toured the US extensively, the band's musical style shifted to hard rock for the next three albums.\nThe last two albums brought some member changes and a more 60's &amp; 70's retro sounding style, relying\n heavily on psychedelia and power-pop.\n\nDISCOGRAPHYA\n1988-Flowers In The Rain\n1990-Seasons of Love\n1991-Boomerang\n1992-Through the Forest\n1993-The Ferris Wheel\n1995-The Dreamland Cafe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7180a92727846376a21a012fdfc95c66c24ef627","amp;dn":"Mad+at+the+world-%286+cd%29-by+heavensmetal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7180a92727846376a21a012fdfc95c66c24ef627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,128,169,39,39,132,99,118,162,26,1,47,223,201,92,102,194,78,246,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
