This free and open source library for Java and .NET is the leading tool of its kind, and was primarily developed and maintained by Bruno Lowagie, the author of this book.\niText in Action, Second Edition offers an introduction and a practical guide to iText and the internals of PDF. While at the entry level iText is easy to learn, there's an astonishing range of things you can do once you dive below the surface.

The examples are in Java but they can be easily adapted to.NET............\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a9f53667e2f15a9e581d6c448d5b8bcad3d43a","amp;dn":"iText+in+Action-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a9f53667e2f15a9e581d6c448d5b8bcad3d43a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,169,245,54,103,226,241,90,158,88,29,108,68,141,91,139,202,211,212,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
