T-Model Ford is also joined by Brian Olive (Greenhornes, Soledad Brothers) and Matthew Smith (Outrageous Cherry, Volebeats) on a few of the songs, showcasing his raw and rugged vocals with heavy reverb laden guitar. Standouts include ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBig Legged WomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which clocks in at just under 8 minutes and traditional blues closer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLittle Red Rooster.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ T-Model FordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s other nickname is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTaildraggerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (an aviation term for a landing gear configuration) and whether or not the album title is a play on his nickname, referring to all the tales and folklore that follow him around, Taledragger is sure one of the best blues releases this year. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ JFelton \n\nWhat Ford, Olive, Smith, Alexander, and the rest have wrought on Taledragger is a modern blues album with primitive roots. The tension works. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a far more interesting recording because of its &quot;impurities&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ paradoxically, making it a far more &quot;authentic&quot; blues record because it is linked to multiple historic traditions simultaneously. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exponentially more enjoyable and exciting as blues than anything coming out of Chicago in the 21st century. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Thom Jurek / AMG\n\n\nTracklist\n1.
