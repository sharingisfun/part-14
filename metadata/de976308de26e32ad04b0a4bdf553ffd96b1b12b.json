Digging into a profound knowledge of reflux still physics, and applying that knowledge in new ways, Riku has designed compound reflux stills that require almost no tuning to crank out the refluxer\\'s holy grail, the 95.6% ethanol-4.4% water azeotrope hour after hour. He does this by letting the vapor composition itself adjust the reflux ratio to optimum, using the Automatic Reflux Control, or ARC. In addition, ARC also eliminates the offensive \\&quot;tails\\&quot; in the spirit.\n\nWith a bit more design twiddling, Riku captures and holds the noxious \\&quot;heads\\&quot; before they get into the distillate. With some simple electrics (no complex electronics here), he transforms ARC to E-ARC, Electric Automatic Reflux Control to produce even finer distillate.\n\nRiku shows you how to make usable still boilers from polypropylene buckets, how to build several air-cooled stills, and how to assemble copper still heads with no soldering.\n\nIf you think you knew where the limits of home distillation of ethanol were, this book will change you forever, an absolute must-read for vodka distillers and potstillers alike.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de976308de26e32ad04b0a4bdf553ffd96b1b12b","amp;dn":"Designing+and+Building+Automatic+Stills+-+by+Riku","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de976308de26e32ad04b0a4bdf553ffd96b1b12b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,151,99,8,222,38,227,42,208,75,10,75,223,85,63,253,150,177,177,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
