What advantage does the Phillips-head screw have over its single-grooved predecessor? Why does the paper clip look the way it does? What makes Scotch tape Scotch?\n\n   In this delightful book Henry, Petroski takes a microscopic look at artifacts that most of us count on but rarely contemplate, including such icons of the everyday as pins, Post-its, and fast-food &quot;clamshell&quot; containers.  At the same time, he offers a convincing new theory of technological innovation as a response to the perceived failures of existing productsÃ¢â‚¬â€suggesting that irritation, and not necessity, is the mother of invention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5e480fe71b788e8a287c51c5c0dc91e51ad9026","amp;dn":"The+Evolution+of+Useful+Things%3A+How+Everyday+Artifacts-From+Fork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5e480fe71b788e8a287c51c5c0dc91e51ad9026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,228,128,254,113,183,136,232,162,135,197,28,92,13,201,30,81,173,144,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
