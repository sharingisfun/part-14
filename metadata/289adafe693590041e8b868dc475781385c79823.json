A woman of intellect and presence, Elizabeth was the object of extravagant adoration by her contemporaries. She firmly believed in the divine providence of her sovereignty and exercised supreme authority over the intrigue-laden Tudor court and Elizabethan England at large. Brilliant, mercurial, seductive, and maddening, an inspiration to artists and adventurers and the subject of vicious speculation over her choice not to marry, Elizabeth became the most powerful ruler of her time. Anne Somerset has immortalized her in this splendidly illuminating account.\n\n.ePUB, .MOBI, .TXT, .PDF\n\nreleased by LibRARiuS\n'Only the educated are free'\nEpictetus\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:289adafe693590041e8b868dc475781385c79823","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+I+by+Anne+Somerset+ebook+epub%2Fmobi%2Fpdf%2Ftxt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"289adafe693590041e8b868dc475781385c79823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,154,218,254,105,53,144,4,30,139,134,141,196,117,120,19,133,199,152,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
