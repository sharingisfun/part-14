Written by Steve Harris, the band's bass player and primary songwriter, it serves as the title track to Iron Maiden's 1992 album Fear of the Dark.\n\nThe single &quot;Fear of the Dark (live)&quot; is the 26th single released by the band. When the song is performed live, the audience always sings along to the melody during the soft (and sometimes the heavy) sections. It has been featured on all the band's live albums since its release.\n\nThe cover features Eddie as Steve himself playing on his bass guitar live on stage.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Fear of the Dark (live)&quot; (Steve Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:22\n    &quot;Be Quick Or Be Dead (live)&quot; (Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers) - 3:20 \n    &quot;Hooks in You (live)&quot; (Bruce Dickinson, Adrian Smith) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:45","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0e003f01fcdd2231ba062a38c5b5df6f11538a1","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Fear+Of+The+Dark+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0e003f01fcdd2231ba062a38c5b5df6f11538a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,224,3,240,31,205,210,35,27,160,98,163,140,91,93,246,241,21,56,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
