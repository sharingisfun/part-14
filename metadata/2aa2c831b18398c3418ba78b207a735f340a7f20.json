It also moves the discussion beyond the theories, principles, and laws that have been so often debated to the actual empirical consequences of affirmative action in the United States and in India, Nigeria, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and other countries. Both common patterns and national differences are examined. Much of what emerges from a factual examination of these policies flatly contradicts much of what was expected and much of what has been claimed.\n\n256 pages\nPublisher: Yale University Press; 1St Edition edition (March 10, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0300101996\nISBN-13: 978-0300101997","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa2c831b18398c3418ba78b207a735f340a7f20","amp;dn":"Affirmative+Action+Around+the+World+%282004%29+by+Thomas+Sowell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aa2c831b18398c3418ba78b207a735f340a7f20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,162,200,49,177,131,152,195,65,139,167,139,32,122,115,95,52,10,127,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
