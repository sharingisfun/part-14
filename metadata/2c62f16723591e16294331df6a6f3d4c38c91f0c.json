She withdrew from her friends and family, changed her personality to hide her invisible scars, and let the pain slowly devour her. Now, in her final semester of college, she still struggles against paralyzing fear just trying to speak up in class, and the terror and helplessness linger on in her nightmares.\n\nAcross campus, Owen sees his scars in the mirror every morning while he gets ready for class. They remind him of the broken home he left behind, the father he hates and fears, and the little sister he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t protect. Now, in his final semester of college, he is scared that he may have to return to the hell he called home after staying away for almost five years.\n\nWhen Owen becomes a teaching assistant for one of MariaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classes, they find themselves irresistibly drawn to each other. As they learn each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secrets and grow closer, they realize that although they may be lost, neither one is alone anymore.\n\nThis new-adult contemporary romance is recommended for ages 17+ due to sexual content and heavy subject matter.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c62f16723591e16294331df6a6f3d4c38c91f0c","amp;dn":"Lost+%28Lost+%26amp%3B+Found+%231%29+by+Nadia+Simonenko+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c62f16723591e16294331df6a6f3d4c38c91f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,98,241,103,35,89,30,22,41,67,49,223,106,111,61,76,56,201,31,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
