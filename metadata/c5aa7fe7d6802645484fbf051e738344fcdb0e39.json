ENJoY!\n\nHUGH TRACEY RECORDINGS - At the Court of the Mwami (Rwanda 1952)\n\nReview by John Vallier\n\nFor five centuries the Tutsi Banyiginya dynasty held court in Rwanda. But with departure of the Belgian colonists ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ who employed the Tutsis to maintain order ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the establishment of an independent Republic of Rwanda in 1961, the Tutsi reign came to an end. With its downfall the Tutsi Mwami, or king-shepherd, fled, and the highly developed arts forms that were unique to his court began to disappear. In 1952 musicologist Hugh Tracey toured Rwanda and documented one of the last Mwami courts. A portion of his recordings is presented here, on At the Court of Mwami, Ruanda. Though the Tutsis were in control of the court, the performers heard here are of Tutsi, Twa, and Hutu descent. After a short documentary introduction by none other than Tracey himself, seven royal drumbeats are played. Each has its own communal symbolism and complex musical characteristics. These are thoroughly composed works that makes use of 4/4, 6/8, 5/5, and 11/8 time. In contrast to these bristling beats is a male-female vocal duo singing about the Mwami's sojourn to Belgium. It's a highly dynamic tune that begins with gentle low notes, works its way up into oxygen-deprived heights, and then cascades back down to its warm opening mood. Not only a collection of amazing and diverse musical performances, At the Court of Mwami, Ruanda is a historical document that highlights Rwanda's complex and often tumultuous past. Detailed liner notes, which are a trademark of all CDs in this series, do an excellent job at contextualizing the performances. Again, another stellar Historical Recordings by Hugh Tracey release.\n\n01 Hugh Tracey Speaks 00:08 \n02 Zirasuka 02:04 \n03 Imirindi 01:09 \n04 Uruchina 02:48 \n05 Umuterero 02:03 \n06 Ichimanura 02:37 \n07 Agasiga 02:48 \n08 Ichirusha 02:34 \n09 Nimuze Tugweragwere 03:18 \n10 Hahirwa Nyiramibambwe 02:38 \n11 Amaliza 01:28 \n12 Benimana 01:28 \n13 Mpundu 02:58 \n14 Igiterane 02:57 \n15 Rukanga Rwamajana 02:50 \n16 Ikizire 01:20 \n17 Ingaju 01:36 \n18 Kyarutema 02:59 \n19 Inyamibwa 02:33 \n20 Lama 02:46 \n21 Akakira Urubunda Uwabigega Umu 05:49 \n22 Ibiteyo 00:54 \n23 Zigezikaragwe 02:28 \n24 Agasiga K'I Gaseke 01:50 \n25 Uruchantege 02:51\n\nQuality: 192Kbps + cover\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5aa7fe7d6802645484fbf051e738344fcdb0e39","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+At+the+Court+of+the+Mwami+%28Rwanda+1952%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5aa7fe7d6802645484fbf051e738344fcdb0e39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,170,127,231,214,128,38,69,72,79,191,5,30,115,131,68,252,219,14,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
