As the collection begins, FAME makes the leap from studio to label with Jimmy HughesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Steal Away,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a brilliant Southern soul single that pointed the way to the future and placed Rick HallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Muscle Shoals studio on the map.\nFAME signed a distribution deal with Vee-Jay, a venture that wound up not quite suiting their needs, so they wound up jumping camp to Atlantic later, but this installment traces the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earliest years, when they were still scrambling for a distinctive voice. Hits came slow when they came at all but, in retrospect, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the pleasure of thisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nuncertain era: Hall let songwriter/producers Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham figure out what would work and what wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, giving them the leeway to fail, which occasionally meant FAME artists were chasing the success of other hitmakers, including when the Villagers covered the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Gonna Lose That Girl.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ At times, the brain trust at FAME shot for the pop fences Ã¢â‚¬â€ Terry Woodford is the greatest example of AM pop desires Ã¢â‚¬â€ but toward the end of this comp, the deep soulful groove of the South surfaces on sides by Arthur Conley and Clarence Carter, the latter becoming the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first true star. These sides, which amount to about a quarter of the comp, will be what satisfy deep soul fans, but the rest of the compilation compels because it showcases a label that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know quite know how to move forward and were happy to try anything that might stick. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some pure pop and blue-eyed soul, the kind of thing that would suggest a crossover, but much of this is loose, funky, and grooving, music that was made not for the charts but for the love of it, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why these singles werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hits at the time but endure decades later.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a95612bc5d338ef07a8687d229d986018424bc98","amp;dn":"VA+-+The+Complete+FAME+Singles+Vol+1+1964-67+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a95612bc5d338ef07a8687d229d986018424bc98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,86,18,188,93,51,142,240,122,134,135,210,41,217,134,1,132,36,188,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
