She has won 16 Juno Awards and seven Grammy Awards, was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards. Morissette began her career in Canada, and as a teenager recorded two dance-pop albums, Alanis and Now Is the Time, under MCA Records Canada.\n\nHer first international album was the rock-influenced Jagged Little Pill, released in 1995. Jagged has sold more than 33 million units globally.[2][3][4] Her following album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was released in 1998 and was a success as well. Morissette took up producing duties for her subsequent albums, which include Under Rug Swept, So-Called Chaos and Flavors of Entanglement. Her eighth studio album, Havoc and Bright Lights, was released on August 28, 2012. Morissette has sold more than 60 million albums worldwide.[5][6][7] Morissette is also known for her powerful and emotive mezzo-soprano voice. \n\n\nHavoc and Bright Lights 2012\n\n\nHavoc and Bright Lights is the eighth studio album by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette and was released on August 28, 2012. The album is her first release on Collective Sounds (distributed by Sony label, RED Distribution) and marks her first release away from Maverick Records, her label since 1995. It was produced by Guy Sigsworth and Joe Chiccarelli, the former having produced her previous album, Flavors of Entanglement (2008). The album received mixed reviews from music critics, praising her softer tones and production, while some criticized the album's overproduction along with its lyrical content and the inclusion of spiritual aspects. The first single released from the album was &quot;Guardian&quot;.\n\nIn June 2011, Guy Sigsworth, producer of Morissette's Flavors of Entanglement, wrote on Twitter that he was in Los Angeles working with a &quot;certain amazing Canadian lady&quot;.[2] On February 28, Morissette shared a video (shot in May 2011) of her recording a song, and Sigsworth's voice behind the scenes made it obvious she was working with him. In May 2011, Morissette shared a song called &quot;Into a King&quot;, on the occasion of the one-year anniversary of her marriage, which was co-written with Sigsworth. She also recorded &quot;Magical Child&quot; for the compilation album Every Mother Counts. In November 2011, Morissette appeared on the American Music Awards, saying she had written 31 songs and had to choose the final twelve for the record.\n\nRolling Stone magazine announced that Morissette's new album would be released in June 2012 and shared the titles of songs &quot;Havoc&quot; and &quot;Celebrity&quot;. The magazine also wrote that nearly every tune has a monster chorus.[3] On May 2, Billboard magazine wrote that Morissette's new album would be released on August 28, 2012 through Collective Sounds. The album was distributed by Sony's RED.[4] On May 23, the album became available for pre-order at Amazon.com.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Guardian&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Woman Down&quot; \n3.\t&quot;'Til You&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Celebrity&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Empathy&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Lens&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Spiral&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Numb&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Havoc&quot; \n10.\t&quot;Win and Win&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Receive&quot; \n12.\t&quot;Edge of Evolution&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79b2c2f6f4e968362914f74677283ee0f65e16a0","amp;dn":"Alanis+Morissette+-+Havoc+And+Bright+Lights+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79b2c2f6f4e968362914f74677283ee0f65e16a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,178,194,246,244,233,104,54,41,20,247,70,119,40,62,224,246,94,22,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
