Although classified at times as a teen idol, he favored brooding themes of abandonment, loss, and rejection. In some respects he looked forward to the British Invasion with his frequent use of minor chords and his ability to write most of his own material. In fact, Shannon was able to keep going strong for a year or two into the British Invasion, and never stopped trying to play original music, though his commercial prospects pretty much died after the mid-'60s.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/del-shannon-p5407/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/del-shannon-p5407/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nGreatest Hits features 20 tracks from Del Shannon's early-'60s heyday, including all of the big hits -- &quot;Runaway,&quot; &quot;Hats Off to Larry,&quot; &quot;Little Town Flirt,&quot; &quot;Handy Man,&quot; &quot;Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow the Sun),&quot; &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; -- plus a generous selection of lesser-known but equally fine singles and album tracks. Completists should fill in the gaps with his neglected gem I Go to Pieces, but Greatest Hits remains a definitive retrospective from one of the finest pre-Beatles rockers of the '60s.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-rhino-r17838&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-rhino-r17838&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032T6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032T6&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
