Now CroninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new novel, The Summer Guest, fulfills that promiseÃ¢â‚¬â€and more. With a rare combination of emotional insight, narrative power, and lyrical grace, Cronin transforms the simple story of a dying manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last wish into a rich tapestry of family love.\n\nOn an evening in late summer, the great financier Harry Wainwright, nearing the end of his life, arrives at a rustic fishing camp in a remote area of Maine. He comes bearing two things: his wish for a day of fishing in a place that has brought him solace for thirty years, and an astonishing bequest that will forever change the lives of those around him.\n\nFrom the battlefields of Italy to the turbulence of the Vietnam era, to the private battles of love and family, The Summer Guest reveals the full history of this final pilgrimage and its meaning for four people: Jordan Patterson, the haunted young man who will guide Harry on his last voyage out; the campÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s owner Joe Crosby, a Vietnam draft evader who has spent a lifetime Ã¢â‚¬Å“trying to learn what it means to be braveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife, Lucy, the woman Harry has loved for three decades; and Joe and LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter KateÃ¢â‚¬â€the spirited young woman who holds the key to the last unopened door to the past.\n\n\nAs their stories unfold, secrets are revealed, courage is tested, and the bonds of love are strengthened. And always center stage is the place itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€a magical, forgotten corner of New England where the longings of the human heart are mirrored in the wild beauty of the landscape.\n\nIntimate, powerful, and profound, The Summer Guest reveals Justin Cronin as a storyteller of unique and marvelous talent. It is a book to treasure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c95993637a7d48a28397b27ec1579c90905418ed","amp;dn":"The+Summer+Guest+-+Justin+Cronin.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c95993637a7d48a28397b27ec1579c90905418ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,89,147,99,122,125,72,162,131,151,178,126,193,87,156,144,144,84,24,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
