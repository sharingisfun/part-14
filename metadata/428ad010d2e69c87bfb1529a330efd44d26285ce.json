Music of the Spheres, like its predecessors Unfinished Monkey Business and Golden Greats, coalesces around a shuffling, semi-funky rhythm section, spasmodic guitar sparks, and Ian&amp;#039;s comfy, flat vocal intoning a mixed bag of cosmic insights. The conservatism is no drawback: Brown has found a winning formula and is not minded to change it. So, in addition to the musical familiarity, King Monkey revisits previous lyrical concerns: both &quot;Gravy Train&quot; and &quot;Whispers&quot; condemn Met Bar-frequenting, cocaine-abusing media types, and &quot;Hear No Speak No&quot; is merely glancing mystic guff. Brown can do much better and, thankfully, he does. On the layered, symphonic &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; he recites a string of acronyms (For Everyman a Religion, Final Execution and Resurrection, etc) over a luscious stoned beat, and &quot;Stardust&quot; is a lurching, baggy groove-heavy monster from the halcyon days of Madchester, as is the trippy, knowing &quot;Bubbles&quot;. True, Ian Brown is still no Sinatra, but to the credit of this maverick icon, Music of the Spheres is a clever, insidious album from a man who knows exactly what he&amp;#039;s doing. \n\nEnjoy! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:428ad010d2e69c87bfb1529a330efd44d26285ce","amp;dn":"Ian+Brown+-+Music+Of+The+Spheres","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"428ad010d2e69c87bfb1529a330efd44d26285ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,138,208,16,210,230,156,135,191,177,82,154,51,14,253,68,210,98,133,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
