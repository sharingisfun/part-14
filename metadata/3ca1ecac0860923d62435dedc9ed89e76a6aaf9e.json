It was written from 1913 onwards. Although it was shown to selected friends, such as Christopher Isherwood, it was only published in 1971 after ForsterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s death.\n\nThe novel is remarkable for its time in describing same-sex love in a non-condemnatory way. Forster resisted publication because of public and legal attitudes to homosexuality a note found on the manuscript read: &quot;Publishable, but worth it?&quot;. Forster was particularly keen that his novel should have a happy ending, but knew that this would make the book too controversial. However, by the time he died, British attitudes and law had changed.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ca1ecac0860923d62435dedc9ed89e76a6aaf9e","amp;dn":"Maurice+-+E+M+Forster+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ca1ecac0860923d62435dedc9ed89e76a6aaf9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,161,236,172,8,96,146,61,98,67,93,237,201,237,137,231,106,106,175,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
