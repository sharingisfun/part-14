Paradise is another subtly political collection of covers from this enduring folk supremo, who has made a career out of illuminating interpretations of other musiciansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ material.\n\nThe duskier tones of Joan Baez join Collins on Diamonds And Rust; thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a particularly eloquent version of Tim BuckleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s protest lament Once I Was; and Collins is utterly haunting on Dens Of Yarrow.\n\nThe quiet piano-and-guitar arrangements are tasteful rather than startling but CollinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need much adornment and, aside from a slightly saccharine cover of Somewhere Over The Rainbow, this is a blissful and beautiful record. \n\nARTiST..[ judy collins\nTiTLE...[ paradise\nLABEL...[ wildflower rec ENCODER.[ lame\nYEAR....[ 2010 QUALiTY.[ avg. 158kbps\nSOURCE..[ cdda MODE....[ joint-stereo\nPLAYTIME[ 43:22 min REL.DATE[ 06.29.2010\nTRACKS..[ 10 \nSiZE....[ 49.1 MB\n\n\n01 over the rainbow 03:30\n02 diamonds and rust 03:35\n   (duet with joan baez feat. nashville rhythm sectio\n03 once i was (featuring nashville rhythm section) 03:13\n04 weight of the world 05:41\n   (featuring nashville rhythm section)\n05 last thing on my mind (duet with stephen stills) 02:58\n06 dens of yarrow (featuring stephen stills) 04:33\n07 kingdom come 06:13\n   (featuring nashville rhythm section, joan baez)\n08 emilio 03:54\n09 ghost riders in the sky 03:54\n   (featuring nashville rhythm section, chost riders\n10 gauguin 05:51 \n\nTOTAL: 43:22 \n\nSEED AND ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e59edec6c7c8af8d667da6079a22c93119782dc","amp;dn":"Judy+Collins+-+Paradise+%282010%29+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e59edec6c7c8af8d667da6079a22c93119782dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,89,237,236,108,124,138,248,214,103,218,96,121,162,44,147,17,151,130,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
