It was subsequently published as a three-volume set in July 1841, with illustrations by George Cruikshank. The first of William Harrison Ainsworth's seven &quot;Lancashire novels&quot;, the story is based on the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, an unsuccessful attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Ainsworth relied heavily on historical documents describing the trial and execution of the conspirators, of whom Fawkes was one, but he also embellished the known facts. The novel's themes deal with British politics and history, focusing on the events surrounding the 1605 plot to destroy Parliament","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8fa767a342a042aa38a7341f068eccf9be19aad","amp;dn":"Guy+Fawkes+or+The+Gunpowder+Treason+-+William+Harrison+Ainsworth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8fa767a342a042aa38a7341f068eccf9be19aad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,250,118,122,52,42,4,42,163,138,115,65,240,104,236,207,155,225,154,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
