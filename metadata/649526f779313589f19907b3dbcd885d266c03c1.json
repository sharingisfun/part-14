Her only real relatives are members from the James Clinton family, but they show little interest in the teenager. She is brought to New York by one of their butlers, where she moves in with a bunch of snobs. The upperclass people are not impressed with her, but Connie is able to befriend the servants.\n\nOne afternoon, her cousin Barbara Clinton orders Connie to stop Ted Drake from going riding without her. Connie tries the best she can, which results into embarrassing herself. She has secretly fallen in love with him and is full with joy when she learns the Drake family is organizing a ball. The servants raise money to buy her a fashionable dress. However, Barbara spreads a lie and Connie is eventually prohibited from attending the ball.\n\nConnie is heartbroken, until the servants arrange a limousine she can use until midnight. At the ball, everyone is impressed with her singing talents. Ted notices her and tries to charm her. They eventually kiss, when Connie realizes it is midnight. She runs off, but accidentally leaves one of her slippers behind. Ted finds the slipper and tries to locate the owner.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara has found out Connie was at the ball. Infuriated, she tries to break Connie's confidence and fires all the servants. The next day, Connie is missing as well. She returns to Miss Wiggins' school in the hope of becoming a music teacher. Ted follows her and they reunite in the end.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 84 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 84 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:649526f779313589f19907b3dbcd885d266c03c1","amp;dn":"Deanna+Durbin+Sweetheart+Pack+-+First+Love+%281939%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Rob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"649526f779313589f19907b3dbcd885d266c03c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,149,38,247,121,49,53,137,241,153,7,179,219,205,136,93,38,108,3,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
