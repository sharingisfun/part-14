The goal was &quot;to create a text that would make the same impact in the life of modern readers that the original text had for the original readers&quot;.\n\nThe process began in 1989 with eighty-seven translators. The translation was completed and published in 1996. This Second Edition was released in 2004.\n\n66 books in seperate plain text files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a33b91f1a22b7aa3300c708a42d9bee9be782e1","amp;dn":"New+Living+Translation+of+The+Holy+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a33b91f1a22b7aa3300c708a42d9bee9be782e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,51,185,31,26,34,183,170,51,0,199,8,164,45,155,238,155,231,130,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
