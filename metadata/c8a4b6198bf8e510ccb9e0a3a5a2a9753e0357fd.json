The course begins with some background on dynamic range, on how camera sensors detect shadows, and on the kinds of subjects that benefit from HDR. Ben then describes and demonstrates several methods of generating HDR images, starting with single-shot HDR, which relies on masking to subtly enhance the dynamic range of a shot. Next, the course covers multi-exposure HDR, which involves shooting several photos of a scene, each at a different exposure, and then combining them using software tools. Ben demonstrates how to use Photoshop and the popular Photomatix software to process HDR images whose appearance ranges from subtle to surreal.\nTopics include:\n\n    *Understanding how the image sensor detects shadows\n    *Capturing a broader dynamic range\n    *Knowing when to use HDR\n    *Finding good HDR subject matter\n    *Using gradient masks to improve dynamic range\n    *Merging in Photoshop and processing elsewhere\n    *Dealing with ghosting\n    *Reducing noise and correcting chromatic aberrations\n    *Handling HDR images that seem flat\n    *Combining HDR and LDR (low dynamic range)\n    *Selective editing with HDR Efex Pro\n    *Creating panoramic HDR images\n    *Creating an HDR time lapse\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a4b6198bf8e510ccb9e0a3a5a2a9753e0357fd","amp;dn":"Lynda+dot+com+Shooting+and+Processing+HDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a4b6198bf8e510ccb9e0a3a5a2a9753e0357fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,164,182,25,139,248,229,16,204,185,224,163,165,162,169,117,62,3,87,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
