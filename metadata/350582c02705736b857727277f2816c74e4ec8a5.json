Sam inherits a house in Perth, but bad luck leads     \n      him to rent half of it out. The Lambs move in to No. 1 Cloud       \n                             Street.\n\nSet                              \n    in and around Perth during the 40s and 50s, Cloudstreet tells the    \n    story of two rural families who suffer separate catastrophes and     \n     flee to the city to pick up the pieces of their lives and start     \n     again. Brought together in the same house at No.1 Cloud Street,     \n    the Lambs and the Pickles' share numerous tragedies and triumphs     \n     that draw them closer together, until the roof over their heads     \n                    becomes a home for their hearts.                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                    \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                \n             \n                                                                           \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                    \n                                             \n                                              \n                                                      \n                                                         \n                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n                \n                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n          Decided to do it at 700mb being a dsr rip....Enjoy!!           \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                  \n                \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                           \n                                                     \n                                      \n                                              \n                                                     \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                             \n                                                                         \n                \n                                                                   \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n           Shell &amp;
