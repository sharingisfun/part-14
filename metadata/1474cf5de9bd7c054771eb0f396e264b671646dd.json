As a founding member of the pioneering American groups the Byrds and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, he helped create and popularize the highly influential folk-rock sound, forging the richly harmonic, radiantly acoustic approach which defined the West Coast music scene for years to follow; he also sold millions of records and enjoyed a cultural impact equaled by few of his contemporaries. Yet despite his often overwhelming success, Crosby is recognized far less for his artistic achievements than for his larger-than-life off-stage exploits, specifically a long and fantastically excessive battle with drug abuse which seemingly kept him teetering on the brink of death for over a decade; that he not only survived but remained as colorful and newsworthy a character as before is a testament to his continued creativity and unpredictability. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.90% CDDA &amp; 99.87% CDDA &amp; 99.81% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\tR2 77628\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1474cf5de9bd7c054771eb0f396e264b671646dd","amp;dn":"David+Crosby+-+Voyage+3CD+Box+Set+%282006%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1474cf5de9bd7c054771eb0f396e264b671646dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,116,207,93,233,189,124,5,71,113,235,15,57,110,38,75,103,22,70,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
