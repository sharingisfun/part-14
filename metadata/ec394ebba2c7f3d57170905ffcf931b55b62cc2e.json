In appearance, the Dash 8-32BWH is unlike anything else on the Amtrak roster, featuring a North American wide cab set in front of a traditional road-switcher body. When built, the locomotives were dressed in a flashy red, white, blue and grey Amtrak livery. \r\n\r\nAt first, Dash 8-32BWHs were assigned to short-haul trains, such as the Los Angeles-San Diego San Diegans, as well as premier long-distance trains including the California Zephyr. Since the arrival of Amtrakâ€™s Genesis diesels, the Dash 8-32BWH, now dressed in Amtrakâ€™s current blue and silver livery, has primarily been assigned to short-haul trains and often serve as terminal switchers at locations such as Miami and Chicago. \r\n\r\nThe Dash 8-32BWH for Train Simulator is available in both its original Amtrak livery and present-day scheme, and also includes a set of Amtrak Superliner passenger equipment. The locomotive is ideal for passenger duty on US routes from coast to coast! \r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS ADDON WILL NOT WORK ON LEGIT TRAIN SIMUALTOR 2016!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec394ebba2c7f3d57170905ffcf931b55b62cc2e","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2016+DTG+Amtrak%26reg%3B+Dash+8-32BWH+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec394ebba2c7f3d57170905ffcf931b55b62cc2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,57,78,187,162,199,243,213,113,112,144,95,252,249,49,181,91,98,204,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
