Bill is a music FAN in the greatest sense and he knows no genre boundary. This music is well executed and Bill keeps his singing to cuts that his limited vocal range can handle, and his singing has improved from earlier solo efforts. You won&amp;#039;t even notice. Highly recommended for anyone who loves music from a time when music was music.&quot;\n\n&quot;This cd is a anachronistic masterpiece of what blues, jazz, and rock are all about. It also show how great the Stones really are to continue to recognize the greatness of black music, and how much it has influenced all of our lives.&quot;\n\n&quot;What an improvement over the first release! Bill sticks with Georgie Fame and Bev Skeete on a majority of the vocals. The choice of covers is, again, excellent! The accompanying musicians reads like a who&amp;#039;s who of British rock. This is a fun, fun CD! Can&amp;#039;t wait for the final installment of this great trilogy!&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
