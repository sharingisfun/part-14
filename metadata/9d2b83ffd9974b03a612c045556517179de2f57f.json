He's still alienated from his closest friend, Karrin Murphy, and on exceedingly poor terms with Chicago's number one gangster, John Marcone. And that's just the small stuff -- the creatures of the Nevernever don't take vacations and aren't particularly worried about Harry's friendships or love life.\n\n============================================\n\nJim Butcher's The Dresden Files Ghoul Goblin 2 - Feb 2013\n\n25 Pages | HQ PDF | English | 13 MB\n\nStill reeling from the events of Fool Moon, Harry's been hired by a small-town Deputy Sheriff to look into a series of bizarre deaths linked to a singularly unfortunate family named the Talbots. Far from his usual Windy City stomping grounds, Mr. Dresden has nevertheless found some very familiar obstacles -- hostile law enforcement officials, reluctant civilians, and people protecting secrets. Oh, and at least one supernatural threat that isn't about to go down without a fight -- or at all.\n\n============================================ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2b83ffd9974b03a612c045556517179de2f57f","amp;dn":"Jim+Butchers+The+Dresden+Files+Ghoul+Goblin+%28PDF%29+1-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2b83ffd9974b03a612c045556517179de2f57f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,43,131,255,217,151,75,3,166,18,192,69,85,101,23,23,157,226,245,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
