What if the Russians had succeeded in landing on the moon before the Americans? What if the epicentre of the cold war had been Paris, and not Berlin? What if the assassination in Dallas had happened in 1973, and not in 1963? What if the Germans had won the First World War? What if imagination had taken power in May 68? What if the anarchists had overthrown Tsar Nicolas II in 1917? All these stories, based on historical facts and realistic assumptions allow us to discover the consequences of one day where everything changes: D-DAY.\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND COMMENT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92904ece0a7db6ac066c72bc0fab4bd6ceed4387","amp;dn":"D-Day+01+-+Russians+On+The+Moon+-%3DSPIDAROT+SHARE%3D-+.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92904ece0a7db6ac066c72bc0fab4bd6ceed4387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,144,78,206,10,125,182,172,6,108,114,188,15,171,75,214,206,237,67,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
