Track information and cover art may therefore not be available for all of them. I went and checked at Amazon.com for each one to verify that they were out of print; some are available used, one was listed for SIXTY DOLLARS (!) and some simply didn&amp;#039;t exist. These are lost treasures. Keep them well for me.\n\nTo save time and space, I ripped these at 320 kb rather than in Windows Lossless. As before, there are five torrents in total. This one includes:\n\nHarmonia Mundi 1994 New Release Sampler\nOfficium (Jan Garbarek) &lt;-- medieval Czech chants + modern saxophone = unique listening experience\nIstampitta II (NY Ensemble for Early Music)\nA Treasure Of Music For Hurdy-Gurdy (Rene Zosso ; Anne Osnowycz) &lt;-- this was the $60 one\n\nBe certain to download my other torrents of medieval and archaic music! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!\n\n-- Rivenshield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c74b588f737292db0b90e873f39de1e4a18394","amp;dn":"Music+of+the+Middle+Ages+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c74b588f737292db0b90e873f39de1e4a18394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,199,75,88,143,115,114,146,219,11,144,232,115,243,157,225,228,161,131,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
