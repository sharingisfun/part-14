For the nobility equitation was an essential skill, both socially and militarily. Horses played a pivotal role in warfare and often wore armor as elaborate and expensive as that of their riders.\n\nDrawing exclusively from the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, this catalogue features various types of European horse armor dating from 1480 to 1620. Splendid examples, many of which are unpublished or rarely seen, are examined in terms of style, construction, and decoration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4a3c4b638e6ba877c41b0a511a451fb6a70c15e","amp;dn":"The+Armored+Horse+in+Europe+1480-1620+%28History+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4a3c4b638e6ba877c41b0a511a451fb6a70c15e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,163,196,182,56,230,186,135,124,65,176,165,17,164,81,251,106,112,193,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
