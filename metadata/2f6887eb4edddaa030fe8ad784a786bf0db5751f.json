If not..delete, optimize, and keep looking for the \n\nperfect song.  \n\n\n\nThe commentator (included booklet notes) makes the point that she (Peggy Lee)\n\nwas great because she delivered both BLUES and &quot;POP&quot; with excellence few others,\n\nif any, could reasonably claim.   The (DDD) sound is good...the quintet includes \n\na guitar and vibes (percussion) on some of the tunes.  Mostly slow tempos\n\n\n\n\nMHS    Musical Heritage Society recording\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f6887eb4edddaa030fe8ad784a786bf0db5751f","amp;dn":"Miss+Peggy+Lee+Sings+The+Blues%2C1988%3F%2CMHS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f6887eb4edddaa030fe8ad784a786bf0db5751f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,104,135,235,78,221,218,160,48,254,138,215,132,167,134,191,13,181,117,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
