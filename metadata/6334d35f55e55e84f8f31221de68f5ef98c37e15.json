Fick\n\nDescription:\nIf the Marines are Ã¢â‚¬Å“the few, the proud,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Recon Marines are the fewest and the proudest. Nathaniel FickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth. He leads a platoon in Afghanistan just after 9/11 and advances to the pinnacleÃ¢â‚¬â€ReconÃ¢â‚¬â€ two years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading twenty-two Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam. He vows to bring all his men home safely, and to do so heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need more than his top-flight education. Fick unveils the process that makes Marine officers such legendary leaders and shares his hard-won insights into the differences between military ideals and military practice, which can mock those ideals.\n\nIn this deeply thoughtful account of what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like to fight on todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s front lines, Fick reveals the crushing pressure on young leaders in combat. Split-second decisions might have national consequences or horrible immediate repercussions, but hesitation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an option. One Bullet Away never shrinks from blunt truths, but ultimately it is an inspiring account of mastering the art of war.\n\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/One-Bullet-Away-Making-Officer/dp/0618773436&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/One-Bullet-Away-Making-Officer/dp/0618773436&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6334d35f55e55e84f8f31221de68f5ef98c37e15","amp;dn":"One+Bullet+Away%3A+The+Making+of+a+Marine+Officer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6334d35f55e55e84f8f31221de68f5ef98c37e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,52,211,95,85,229,94,132,248,243,18,33,222,104,245,239,152,195,126,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
