That's What You Get Babe sold poorly and ultimately ended his relationship with Harvest. A couple of the albums that followed, Diamond Jack and the Queen of Pain and Deja Vu were also lackluster mainstream affairs which suffered the same ill fate for their associated labels.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - That's What You Get\n02 - Where Do I Go From Here\n03 - You Never Outrun Your Heart\n04 - Given And Taken\n05 - Idiots\n06 - Super Salesman\n07 - Money, Money, Money\n08 - Miss Hanaga\n09 - I'm So Tired\n10 - Where Do The Stars End\n11 - Don't Let It Get You Down (Live) (bonus track)\n12 - We Did It Again (Live) (bonus track)\n13 - Why Are We Sleeping (Live) (bonus track)\n14 - After The Show (Live) (bonus track)\n\n\n*2014 Parlophone / Warner Music Japan | WPCR-15531\n  {2014 Remaster Japan Mini LP SHM-CD Edition}\n\n\n\nMore Kevin Ayers Remaster Japan Mini LP SHM-CD Edition\n\n\nKevin Ayers - Rainbow Takeaway (1978) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10310459/Kevin_Ayers_-_Rainbow_Takeaway_%281978%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10310459/Kevin_Ayers_-_Rainbow_Takeaway_%281978%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nKevin Ayers - Yes We Have No Mananas (1976) [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10248567/Kevin_Ayers_-_Yes_We_Have_No_Mananas_(1976)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10248567/Kevin_Ayers_-_Yes_We_Have_No_Mananas_(1976)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nKevin Ayers - Odd Ditties (1976) [EAC-FLAC]\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10202773/Kevin_Ayers_-_Odd_Ditties_(1976)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10202773/Kevin_Ayers_-_Odd_Ditties_(1976)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nKevin Ayers - Bananamour (1973) [EAC-FLAC]:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10142289/Kevin_Ayers_-_Bananamour_(1973)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10142289/Kevin_Ayers_-_Bananamour_(1973)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nKevin Ayers - Whatevershebringswesing (1971) [EAC-FLAC]:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10125772/Kevin_Ayers_-_Whatevershebringswesing_(1971)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10125772/Kevin_Ayers_-_Whatevershebringswesing_(1971)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nKevin Ayers - Shooting At The Moon (1970) [EAC-FLAC]:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10079890/Kevin_Ayers_-_Shooting_At_The_Moon_(1970)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10079890/Kevin_Ayers_-_Shooting_At_The_Moon_(1970)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nKevin Ayers - Joy Of A Toy (1969) [EAC-FLAC]:\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10060625/Kevin_Ayers_-_Joy_Of_A_Toy_(1969)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10060625/Kevin_Ayers_-_Joy_Of_A_Toy_(1969)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nKevin Ayers And The Whole World - Hyde Park Free Concert 1970 (2007) [EAC-FLAC]:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9258061/Kevin_Ayers_And_The_Whole_World_-_Hyde_Park_Free_Concert_1970_[E&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9258061/Kevin_Ayers_And_The_Whole_World_-_Hyde_Park_Free_Concert_1970_[E&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
