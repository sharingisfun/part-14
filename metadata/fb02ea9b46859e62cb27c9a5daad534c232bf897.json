She\\&amp;#039;s marketed in the U.S. as a jazz singer, but judging from this stellar collection -- which features not one filler song -- she could fake her ID and ride high on the R&amp;B charts alongside the younger crowd. Her voice can be sweet and airy, as on the dramatic, orchestrally punched opening track, but she digs deeper on more emotional statements like \\&quot;Free the Child.\\&quot; \\&quot;Permanent\\&quot; is a funky power ballad in the classic R&amp;B tradition, while \\&quot;Sweetest Thing\\&quot; rides along a soaring string section and percussive near-disco groove. \\&quot;When the Evening Comes\\&quot; and \\&quot;All I Do\\&quot; do the disco thing very impressively, but with a class reminiscent of Lisa Stansfield. \\&quot;Fire and Rain\\&quot; isn\\&amp;#039;t the James Taylor song, but actually has a hook that would seduce even the most cynical teenybopper. Crawford shows her range on power ballads like \\&quot;Tell It to Your Heart\\&quot; and an acoustic, jazzy cover of \\&quot;Alfie.\\&quot; A welcome return from an artist whose reach should be much more in the mainstream of pop and R&amp;B. ~ Jonathan Widran, All Music Guide\n\n[b]Track listing (m:s:f):[/b]\n\t1.
