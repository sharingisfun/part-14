More than 20 years ago in the hills of Japan, the rules of driving began to be re-written. Over this time to the present, Japan has always been at the forefront of drifting. From the streets in the cities to the Touge passes in the mountains to the dedicated drifting circuits, one thing never changes - Drifting is fun. It is the reason every driver we met does it. Not for the fame or the glory, not for money, not for corporate support, but just pure thrills. See the guys visiting the whole of the south prefecture of Japan including Bihoku, Suzuka Twin and Meihan, plus the crazy city of Nagoya and the surrounding areas and much much more. We capture one of the most insane nights of street drifting for the first time using professional equipment at night. We visit some of the biggest (and smallest) shops in the business including Bee*R, Mind Control, Kids Heart, 326 Power and V-Factory. We hang out with D1 legends and current drivers.\n\n\nEnglish audio with hardcoded Eng Subs.\n\n\n94 min Runtime.\n1.34gb Filesize\n1280 x 720 pixels\nH.264, 1280 x 720, Millions\nAAC, 2 channels, 44100 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1006c8bd12b374896c495e8f310c974111d75bcf","amp;dn":"Driftworks+-+Outsiders+Japan+%28Drifting+Documentary%29+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1006c8bd12b374896c495e8f310c974111d75bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,6,200,189,18,179,116,137,108,73,94,143,49,12,151,65,17,215,91,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
