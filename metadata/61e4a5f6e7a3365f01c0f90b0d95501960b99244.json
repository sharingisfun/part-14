Born in 1946, in St. Elizabeth parish, he grew up in poverty in Trench Town, and trained as a mason. However, music beckoned, and linking with David Webber, brother of the popular Webber Sisters, the pair auditioned around the studios, but to no avail. Thus it was back to masonry, where Griffiths was now working alongside the Ethiopians' Leonard Dillon under a foreman, Leebert Robinson, also looking to enter the music industry. Griffiths convinced Robinson to fund a recording session; with the Supersonics providing accompaniment, the Ethiopians cut &quot;Train to Skaville,&quot; backed by Griffiths' &quot;You Are the Girl,&quot; credited to Al &amp; the Ethiopians. &quot;Train&quot; was a smash, while &quot;Girl&quot; confirmed Griffiths' own potential.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Jah Garden\n02.Good Good Loving\n03.War Is Over\n04.War Is Over (Dub)\n05.Lonely Heart\n06.Babe And Suckling\n07.Trial And Crosses\n08.Unite\n09.Red Hot\n10.Red Hot (Dub)\n11.Determination\n12.Wicked Man\n13.Wicked Man (Dub)\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e4a5f6e7a3365f01c0f90b0d95501960b99244","amp;dn":"The+Gladiators+-+Once+Upon+A+Time+In+Jamaica+%282003%29vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e4a5f6e7a3365f01c0f90b0d95501960b99244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,228,165,246,231,163,54,95,1,192,249,11,13,149,80,25,96,185,146,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
