Rosen has become a bestseller largely due to how effectively it addresses the main portion of the discrete market, which is typically characterized as the mid to upper level in rigor. The strength of Rosen\\'s approach has been the effective balance of theory with relevant applications, as well as the overall comprehensive nature of the topic coverage.\nAbout the Author\n\nKenneth H. Rosen is a Distinguished Member of the Technical Staff at AT&amp;T Laboratories in Middletown, New Jersey. His current assignment involves the assessment of new technology and the creation of new services for AT&amp;T. Dr. Rosen has written several leading textbooks and many articles.
