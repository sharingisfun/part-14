Paul Ferrill leads you from installing the Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) to writing small scripts, to more complicated and interesting projects, and finally to uploading and packaging your programs to an Android device.\nAndroid runs scripts in many scripting languages, but Python, Lua, and Beanshell are particularly popular. Most programmers know more than one programming language, so that they have the best tool for whatever task they want to accomplish. Pro Android Python with SL4A explores the world of Android scripting by introducing you to the most important open-source programming languages that are available on Android-based hardware.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40823664da11175692459a48b0ddc137f1b577c8","amp;dn":"Pro+Android+Python+with+SL4A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40823664da11175692459a48b0ddc137f1b577c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,130,54,100,218,17,23,86,146,69,154,72,176,221,193,55,241,181,119,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
