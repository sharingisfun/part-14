As the movie progresses, a bond of mutual affection develops between the young gunfighter and the old marshall. The marshall tries every way he can to avoid the inevitable gunfight which he know he will win. This movie is essentially about relationships and the differences between youth and maturity rather than just another gunfight. It's one of my top ten westerns.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf582ea2362503837553e92f58f2829425897716","amp;dn":"Last+Challenge%2C+The+%28Western%29+%7BGlenn+Ford%7D+%5B1967%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf582ea2362503837553e92f58f2829425897716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,88,46,162,54,37,3,131,117,83,233,47,88,242,130,148,37,137,119,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
