White Riot \n\nBy Hook or By Crook\nLike the first album by The Bad Shepherds, By Hook or by Crook fuses the best of the Punk era of music and sets it down to Folk music. The result is an album that will stand out as one of timeless quality and a breakthrough in music appreciation.\n\nThe album opens with the Sex Pistols classic Anarchy in the U.K. which has been covered a few times, notably by thrash metal kings Megadeth, but in the hands of the musicians Adrian Edmondson, Troy Donockley, Andy Dinan and their various uses of Thrash Mandolin, Uilleann Pipes and Banjos have made a song which sounds less angry and confrontational and more resigned to the path we could be heading down, its mournful use of the Uilleann Pipes during this song adds a certain frankness to the lyrics.\n\nOne of the surprises on the album is the classic XTC song Making Plans for Nigel, not exactly known as an angry retort to the establishment that Punk was the musical catalyst for, but its inclusion in the album is warranted when seen as a cry about individualism. AdrianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocal approach suits this style perfectly and in an album full of standout tracks, this song can be seen as the pinnacle and highlight.\n\nThere is even the chance to hear the guys take on the world of Heavy Metal in the shape of MotorheadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ace of Spades which will have you drooling in anticipation for more.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/05/the-bad-shepherds/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/05/the-bad-shepherds/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ae3229b34cfc7082b79f9feb0c8cb37d1ab7ab","amp;dn":"The+Bad+Shepherds...By+Hook+Or+By+Crook%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ae3229b34cfc7082b79f9feb0c8cb37d1ab7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,174,50,41,179,76,252,112,130,183,159,159,235,12,140,179,125,26,183,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
