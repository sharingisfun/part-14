Nineteen years later, the line reached Hamburg, and by 1906 was open to Hanoverian station, today known as Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. \n\nIn the early 1970s, a number of trials took place to assess the lineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capability for high speed running at 200km/h. The trials proved to be a success and later that decade, a 78km (48 mile) section from Langenhagen to Uelzen was relaid to accommodate high speed trains, with the rest of the route upgraded by the end of the 1980s. Today, the 153km (95 mile) lines sees a busy mix of high speed and commuter passenger trains alongside regional and international freight trains. \n\nFrom the major transport hub of Hamburg, the route runs south through Harburg, LÃƒÂ¼neburg, Uelzen and Celle. Landmarks along the route include the Metronom Depot at Uelzen, one of the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main maintenance depots for its commuter trains, Hamburg Docks and Hanover FlughafenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s underground station. \n\nSouth of Hamburg is also Maschen Marshalling Yard, EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest such facility and the second largest freight yard in the World. Covering an area of 280 hectares, the yard is around seven kilometres long and has a total track length of 300km, handling up to 11,000 goods wagons each day. \n\nThe line is probably most well-known for its record breaking feat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on 13 August 1980, locomotive 120 002 set a new world speed record of 231km/h for rotary current locomotives between Celle and Uelzen. \n\nThe Hamburg-Hanover route for Train Simulator is an accurate depiction of north GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important railway line, passing through spectacular scenery, unique stations and major freight depots.
