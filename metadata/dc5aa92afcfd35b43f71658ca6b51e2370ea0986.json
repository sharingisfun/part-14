This is a decently put together DVD with menus and track selection. The best description of it I can find online is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.u2boy.nl/u2/u2_bootlegs_video_details.php?id=u2_1992_zootv_outside_broadcast_tv_special:&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.u2boy.nl/u2/u2_bootlegs_video_details.php?id=u2_1992_zootv_outside_broadcast_tv_special:&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;The UK version of the 'Outside Broadcast TV Special, broadcast by MTV. Excellent quality!\n\nThis selection is often referred to as the 'Anaheim' show 1992-11-14. However, if you compare these tracks to the Anaheim audio bootleg (also a seed on this site), they are not the same concert. Further listening and research will reveal this source material seems to be primarily from New York Yankee Stadium and Houston Astrodome (lots of NY references in the video; also cf. Zoo TV Live Transmission by KTS Records, which is the Houston show in its entirety). \n\nThis particular rendering has a couple of flaws. During Zoo Station w/ David Salz below the stage, the video blanks out for about 30 seconds, but the audio is fine. Shortly after, the audio and video are out of synch until the first stanza of The Fly. From there on out, the video occasionally drops out for a frame or 2, but otherwise this recording seems unblemished.\n\nAlso includes interview segments with Kurt Loder, Rex Fox @ Zoo News and Rona Elliot &amp; David Salz Zoo News in the field, Adam 'stalker' video, Edge Nintendo wargames, William Burroughs, Pat Kinney show w/ 'fake' U2 lip-synch to Wild Horses whilst the real band sits in the audience, and Bono's last phone call to George Bush.&quot;\n\nHOWEVER, this version has the missing 30 seconds of video patched in from another source, so it is an improvement over what's described there. \n\nI got this a few years ago from u2torrents.com, and burned it to a DVD. Since then, the torrent I had is long gone, and also removed from u2torrents. I can't honestly remember if there was artwork included or anything like that. I just re-created an ISO image from the disc, and am providing it as a service, since I can't find it out there anywhere.\n\nTo the guys who worked on this originally, did the clean-up on it, authored the DVD, etc...if you're still out there somewhere, THANK YOU BEYOND WORDS!\n\numdesch4\n\nU2 - Zoo TV Outside Broadcast Special (DVD)\n\na.k.A.
