Also discussed are Karl Marx, Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Roosevelt, Gandhi, Castro, Kennedy, Nixon, the '29 crash, the Great Depression, Roosevelt's New Deal, and the massive conflict of World War II.\nShow More \nShow Less \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n''Truly a distinguished work of history . . .
