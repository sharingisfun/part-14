She writes openly about emotional and physical aspects of her 15-month struggle to recover, and explains how her disease impacts her life. In the course of her illness, Regine has photography exhibits, goes to concerts, enjoys her friends &amp; family, and advocates for registering as a blood and bone marrow donor. She was a typical teenager with an amazing will to live; and the lessons she learned have relevance for all of us. She died at home on December 3, 2009 with her family and cat by her side. Originally published in Norway, the book was selected by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture for a translation grant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:611bb5b9d6b0c8e77231e6e7c5806c1c355a1424","amp;dn":"Regine%27s+Book+-+A+Teen+Girl%27s+Last+Word+-+Regine+Stokke+%5BePub%5D+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"611bb5b9d6b0c8e77231e6e7c5806c1c355a1424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,27,181,185,214,176,200,231,114,49,230,231,197,128,108,28,53,90,20,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
