This practical guide shows you how to work hands-on with a variety of storage mechanismsÃ¢â‚¬â€including linked lists, stacks, queues, and graphsÃ¢â‚¬â€within the constraints of the JavaScript environment.\n\nDetermine which data structures and algorithms are most appropriate for the problems youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to solve, and understand the tradeoffs when using them in a JavaScript program. An overview of the JavaScript features used throughout the book is also included.\n\nThis book covers:\n\nArrays and lists: the most common data structures\nStacks and queues: more complex list-like data structures\nLinked lists: how they overcome the shortcomings of arrays\nDictionaries: storing data as key-value pairs\nHashing: good for quick insertion and retrieval\nSets: useful for storing unique elements that appear only once\nBinary Trees: storing data in a hierarchical manner\nGraphs and graph algorithms: ideal for modeling networks\nAlgorithms: including those that help you sort or search data\nAdvanced algorithms: dynamic programming and greedy algorithms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6c5144e47fb4c2d386e3b68f47dee45902fe99d","amp;dn":"Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+with+JavaScript+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6c5144e47fb4c2d386e3b68f47dee45902fe99d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,197,20,78,71,251,76,45,56,110,59,104,244,125,238,69,144,47,233,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
