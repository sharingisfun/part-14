Mastroianni first appears as Parisian traveling salesman Mateo Strano who suddenly shows up at the home of Maria, the wife he abandoned twenty years before. She eventually remarried Andre. Mateo begins telling the skeptical Andre that he never really left Marie. Instead he was bewitched by fairies and has been living in the apartment across the street the entire time. He seems so serious, that he is able to lure Andre to the alleged apartment. There Mateo murders him with a hammer and then calmly returns to Maria who seems nonplused by the sudden turn. With pride she shows Mateo their adopted daughter. Mastroianni next appears as Sorbonne professor of negative anthropology Georges Vickers, a grown man who still lives with his cranky mother until he inexplicably leaves to become a vagrant. Living on the streets, he encounters Tania, a streetwalker with a passion for the philosophies of author Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan. The hooker and the tramp stay together until the day that Vickers returns and he leaves. It is soon afterward that he discovers that Tania is really the president of a major corporation. When he learns that she has been jailed for attempting to murder her creepy ex-husband, Vickers uses his clout to save her. The story then jumps to a newlywed couple happily struggling in a humble garret. Their lives change dramatically when a benefactor suddenly appears and provides them with a marvelous country house. They are also given a mute butler (Mastroianni) who answers their every beck and call. It doesn't take the couple long to figure out that the sinister valet (who actually owns the chateau) is quietly poisoning them. In terror they leave, but later he finds them and demands that they give him their baby daughter. He gives the child to Maria, Mateo's wife. Mastroianni's fourth persona, that of industrial magnate Luc Alamand then appears. He is in trouble when he learns that the wife, daughter, and sister he manufactured to impress potential clients are actually coming. The stress causes the sudden emergence of his other disparate personalities. Interestingly, though each live wildly different lives, they are clearly the same mild-mannered, self-effacing character. The comedy in the story works on wildly different levels with sight gags and puns running simultaneously with literary and cultural satire. Beneath it all runs a serious message about the destructiveness and confusion caused by trying to create a single European culture.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Trois vies &amp; une seule mort.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.36 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 10s\n      Bit rate : 1618 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 11.1 MiB\n      Movie name : Trois vies &amp; une seule mort (1996)\n      Director : Raoul Ruiz\n      Genre : Drama\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Copyright : rip by therthe thanks to Cineleech\n      Product : Movie\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 10s\n      Bit rate : 1421 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.230\n      StreamSize : 1.19 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 2h 9s\n      Bit rate : 190 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 164 MiB\n\nFrench audio; English, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by janatas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff9f851803a3a5c9bf4ccd4d29180e5a2bfa5453","amp;dn":"Raoul+Ruiz+-+Trois+vies+%26+une+seule+mort+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff9f851803a3a5c9bf4ccd4d29180e5a2bfa5453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,159,133,24,3,163,165,201,191,76,205,77,41,24,14,90,43,250,84,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
