In second video he paints it (ofcourse). \n\nThere is a smaaal, tiny problem in second video. It starts with a monster already having base paint (i don't know how many minutes are missing from the begining of the video), but still there is a full hour of color painting and shading the creature. In case someone has the full second vol. please post it. I'd like to have it :) \n\nOh, and there is also a book with this guys creature creations; an artbook that is... (My english = crap) Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d44a57f01bc57e59da82de7a74508785e9a313e","amp;dn":"GNOMON+-+Carlos+Huante+-+Creature+design+Vol+1+%26+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d44a57f01bc57e59da82de7a74508785e9a313e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,68,165,127,1,188,87,229,157,168,45,231,167,69,8,120,94,154,49,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
