Since the mid-'60s, Jones has sung nearly every form of popular music -- pop, rock, show tunes, country, dance, and techno, he's sung it all. His actual style -- a full-throated, robust baritone that had little regard for nuance and subtlety -- never changed, he just sang over different backing tracks. On-stage, Jones played up his sexual appeal; it didn't matter whether he was in an unbuttoned shirt or a tuxedo, he always radiated a raw sexuality which earned him a large following of devoted female fans who frequently threw underwear on-stage. Jones' following never diminished over the decades; he was able to exploit trends, earning new fans while retaining his core following.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tExact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 1\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nCue File:\t\tYes\nM3U File:\t\tYes\nLog file:\t\tIncluded In Torrent Description\n\t\t\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tPolydor/Umgd\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.It's Not Unusual\n02.What's New Pussy Cat\n03.Thunderball\n04.Detroit City\n05.Green, Green Grass Of Home\n06.(It Looks Like) I'll Never Fall In Love Again\n07.Delilah\n08.Love Me Tonight\n09.Without Love (There Is Nothing)\n10.Daughter Of Darkness\n11.She's A Lady\n12.I (Who Have Nothing)\n\n\n\nNote: I didn't include the log file in the torrent for technical reasons.
