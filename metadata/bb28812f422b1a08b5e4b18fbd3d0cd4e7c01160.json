Instead, the groupÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s de facto leader, Robin Pecknold, explained that the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“hippyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ accoutrements of dabblers such as Chris Robinson, of the Black Crowes, were symptomatic of an acquisitiveness that couldnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t be further removed from what hippies initially stood for.\n\n    You can see why it might be a tricky area. The five members of Fleet Foxes must have heard some music made in their lifetimes, but you wouldnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t know it from hearing this debut. Fleet Foxes is proof that the US alt-folk well has yet to run dry. And, indeed, much of what follows an introductory liturgy called Red Squirrel/Sun Rises sounds like a Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young improvising to keep their spirits up while waiting to be rescued from a well.\n\n    So much music meant to evoke what Greil Marcus, in Invisible Republic, referred to as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“old, weird AmericaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ does so simply by keeping it spare and pushing up the reverb knob so that the results canÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t help but sound ethereal. ThereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s an element of that approach with Fleet Foxes. At the same time ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ in particular on the rapt, wordless dawn chorus of Heard Them Stirring ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ it highlights the breadth of their harmonic span. Miraculously for a 21-year-old, Pecknold appears to have perfected the art of writing songs that appear not so much written as retrieved from your own subconscious. Van Morrison achieved a similar thing on his 1974 masterpiece Veedon Fleece, tapping into what he has called a shared ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“folk memoryÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½.\n\n    On Tiger Mountain Peasant Song, Pecknold delves into imagery that could have come straight from that album: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wanderers this morning came by, Where did they go, Graceful in the morning light, To banner fair.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Your Protector is no less cinematic in its span, a last will and testament mapped out around the albumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s biggest hook. On the folk ballad Oliver James, gentle picking gives way to Pecknold detailing its subjectÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s demise: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Washed in the rain, no longer.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½\n\n    Sounding like a desolate Neil Young over a choir of David Crosbys, Pecknold delivers the albumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s most sustained shiver on Meadowlarks. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little children laughing at the boys and girls,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ he sings as though broadcasting from a fever dream, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“The meadowlarks singing to you each and every day.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ And far from being lost in translation, the beauty he writes about seems magnified when Fleet Foxes set about recreating it in notes and chords. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb28812f422b1a08b5e4b18fbd3d0cd4e7c01160","amp;dn":"Fleet+Foxes+-+Fleet+Foxes+%28Limited+Edition+-+2008%29+%5BLossless%2FFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb28812f422b1a08b5e4b18fbd3d0cd4e7c01160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,40,129,47,66,43,26,8,181,228,177,143,189,61,12,212,231,192,17,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
