K. Asante, Jr. released in 2005. It won five international film festival awards (including UNESCO 'Breaking the Chains Award') in the category of Best Documentary. 500 Years Later has received praise as well as controversy, both for the genre of the film (creative documentary), and the social-political impact of the film as it relates to race study. The film opened on February 28, 2005, at the Pan-African Awards (PAFF) and won Best Documentary at its premiere. The film made its American television premiere on August 23, 2008 on TV One (Radio One), and Ethiopian Television premiere on October 27, 2007, and Bounce TV February 08,2012. In 2010, the sequel Motherland was released.\n\nPlot\n\nCrime, drugs, HIV/AIDS, poor education, inferiority complex, low expectation, poverty, corruption, poor health, and underdevelopment plagues people of African descent globally. 500 years later from the onset of slavery and subsequent colonialism, Africans are still struggling for basic freedom. Filmed in five continents, and over twenty countries, 500 Years Later engages the retrospective voice, told from the African vantage-point.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c35d272135b542158c433f68997b1b7a96015a5e","amp;dn":"500+Years+Later+%282005%29+x264+-+Docu+on+American+Slavery+Legacy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c35d272135b542158c433f68997b1b7a96015a5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,93,39,33,53,181,66,21,140,67,63,104,153,123,27,122,150,1,90,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
