Hawkins' first album for a major label. Sadly, on New Year's Day 1995 he succumbed to a massive stroke, leaving this record as his final offering. .\n\nHawkins is supported by subtle and evocative accompaniment-churchly organ here, a steel guitar there-and the players are understated and perfectly suited to the material. The few covers include &quot;There Stands The Glass,&quot; a stirring song that often opened Hawkins' concerts, Jesse Winchester's &quot;Biloxi,&quot; and John Fogerty's &quot;Long As I Can See the Light.&quot; Ted Hawkins was a big man with a big voice, and the spiritual and emotional shadows he cast here will linger for at least the next hundred years.\n\nPersonnel: Ted Hawkins (vocals, guitar); Greg Leisz (lap steel guitar, Hawaiian guitar, pedal steel guitar); Michael Penn, Chris Bruce (guitar); Tony Berg (guitar, keyboards); Martin Tillman (cello); Billy Payne, Patrick Warren (keyboards); John Pierce, Guy Pratt, Kevin McCormick (bass); Pat Mastelotto, Jim Keltner, Greg Wells (drums, percussion); Danny Frankel (percussion).\n\n\n1 Strange Conversation\n2.Big Things\n3.There Stands the Glass  \n4.Biloxi\n5.Groovy Little Things\n6.
