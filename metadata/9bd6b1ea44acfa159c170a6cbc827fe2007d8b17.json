Erickson\n\nPh.D., Yale University\n\n\nIs there a meaning to human life?\nIs there a meaning to human life?\nIs there a meaning to human life?\n\nAll of us have asked ourselves this question. But for philosophers through the ages, it was only the first of many, for they needed to know whether such a question was even answerable by philosophy. And if it was, they needed to ask whether any positive answer could be pursued through the practice of philosophy itself.\n\nToday, these questions remain as timely and controversial as ever. But following the pathway of proposed answers on anything other than a level surfaceÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter how fascinating we find the subjectÃ¢â‚¬â€can often be difficult for those untrained in philosophy and the profound rigor of its arguments and language.\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n  \t\n\n   1.
