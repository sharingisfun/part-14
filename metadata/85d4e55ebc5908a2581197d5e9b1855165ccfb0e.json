Time will tell.\n\nA big thanks to everyone who seeds back my torrents and leaves comments. \n(*_*)Joe\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid Bowie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Patinum Collection [2005] [only1joe] FLAC-EAC\n\t\nDiving into a new David Bowie collection is all about comfort. The listener should land somewhere between the reliable pool of radio staples like &quot;Golden Years,&quot; &quot;Suffragette City,&quot; and &quot;Let's Dance&quot; and the deep water of fan favorites like &quot;TVC 15&quot; and &quot;Look Back in Anger.&quot; EMI's three-disc Platinum Collection does an awfully good job of placating fans of both reservoirs, focusing on the Thin White Duke's mercurial 1969-1987 offerings. Each disc covers an era -- 1969-1974, 1974-1979, and 1980-1987 -- allowing time for both classics (&quot;Starman&quot;) and obscurities (&quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;). The Platinum Collection gets high marks for the inclusion of oft-overlooked gems such as &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; and &quot;Wild Is the Wind,&quot; but it's the appearance of soundtrack nuggets like &quot;When the Wind Blows,&quot; from the animated nuclear war fable of the same name, &quot;Underground&quot; from Labyrinth, and &quot;Drowned Girl&quot; from the play Baal that sets this anthology apart from others.. - Review by James Christopher Monger  \n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] The Jean Genie\n[02] Space Oddity\n[03] Starman\n[04] Ziggy Stardust\n[05] John, I'm Only Dancing (Sax Version)\n[06] Rebel Rebel\n[07] Let's Spend The Night Together\n[08] Suffragette City\n[09] Oh!
