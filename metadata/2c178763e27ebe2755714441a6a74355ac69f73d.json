If these reasons aren't obvious to you, then you shouldn't be torrenting.\n\nEnjoy!  :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c178763e27ebe2755714441a6a74355ac69f73d","amp;dn":"New+ebook+packs+for+ALL+of+2012+Part+3+Addendum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c178763e27ebe2755714441a6a74355ac69f73d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,23,135,99,226,126,190,39,85,113,68,65,166,167,67,85,172,105,247,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
