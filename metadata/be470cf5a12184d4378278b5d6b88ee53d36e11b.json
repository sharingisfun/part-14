This volume presents the work in a new translation by Josefine Nauckhoff, with an introduction by Bernard Williams that elucidates the work's main themes and discusses their continuing importance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be470cf5a12184d4378278b5d6b88ee53d36e11b","amp;dn":"Nietzsche+-+The+Gay+Science+%28CUP%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be470cf5a12184d4378278b5d6b88ee53d36e11b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,71,12,245,161,33,132,212,55,130,120,181,214,184,142,229,61,54,225,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
