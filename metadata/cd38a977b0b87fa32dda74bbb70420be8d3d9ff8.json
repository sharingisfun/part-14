This gory compendium details the frankly ridiculous ways in which a number of ill-fated unfortunates met (or failed to meet) their maker at the hands of lamentably inept executioners. With black and white illustrations, this book brings together a mixture of bungled executions, strange last requests and classic one-liners from medieval times to the present day.\nAbout the Author\nGeoffrey Abbott served for many years as a Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) at the Tower of London. Author of 16 books and contributor to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, he has made numerous television appearances. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Amazing-True-Stories-Execution-Blunders/dp/1840245034/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302279740&amp;sr=8-2-spell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Amazing-True-Stories-Execution-Blunders/dp/1840245034/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302279740&amp;sr=8-2-spell&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd38a977b0b87fa32dda74bbb70420be8d3d9ff8","amp;dn":"Amazing+True+Stories+of+Execution+Blunders+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd38a977b0b87fa32dda74bbb70420be8d3d9ff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,56,169,119,176,184,127,163,45,218,116,187,183,4,32,190,141,61,159,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
