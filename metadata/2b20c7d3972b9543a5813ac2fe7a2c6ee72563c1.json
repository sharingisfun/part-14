Harassment by the Empire and a shortage of vital supplies are hindering completion of a new secret base on the ice planet Hoth. So when Mid Rim merchants offer much-needed materials for sale, Princess Leia Organa and Han Solo lead an Alliance delegation to negotiate a deal.\n\nBut when treachery forces the rebel ship to flee into territory controlled by pirates, Leia makes a shocking discovery: the fierce marauders come from LeiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homeworld of Alderaan, recently destroyed by the Death Star. These refugees have turned to pillaging and plundering to surviveÃ¢â‚¬â€and they are in debt to a pirate armada, which will gladly ransom the princess to the vengeful Empire... if they find out her true identity.\n\nStruggling with intense feelings of guilt, loyalty, and betrayal, Leia is determined to help her wayward kinspeople, even as Imperial forces are closing in on her own crippled ship. Trapped between lethal cutthroats and brutal oppressors, Leia and Han, along with Luke, Chewbacca, and a battle-ready crew, must defy deathÃ¢â‚¬â€or embrace itÃ¢â‚¬â€to keep the rebellion alive.\n\n\n\nremember to support the artist and buy the book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b20c7d3972b9543a5813ac2fe7a2c6ee72563c1","amp;dn":"Martha+Wells+-+Star+Wars+-+Razor%27s+Edge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b20c7d3972b9543a5813ac2fe7a2c6ee72563c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,32,199,211,151,43,149,67,165,129,58,194,254,122,44,110,231,37,99,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
