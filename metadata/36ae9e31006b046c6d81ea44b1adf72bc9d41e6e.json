Kirby's daughter, Lisa Kirby, found the material in KirbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s effects after he died.  Michael Thibodeaux persuaded Lisa to work the ideas into a limited series, although initial ideas were for a film, or animated television series.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36ae9e31006b046c6d81ea44b1adf72bc9d41e6e","amp;dn":"Jack+Kirby%27s+Galactic+Bounty+Hunters+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36ae9e31006b046c6d81ea44b1adf72bc9d41e6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,174,158,49,0,107,4,108,109,129,234,68,177,173,247,43,201,212,30,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
