Well look no more - here it is. Al Gorky (Jeff Goldblum) and Buddy Chester (Forest Whitaker) are the best of friends and two of New York&amp;#039;s finest session musicians. Amongst the care free bohemian world of Jazz clubs and bars, the duo are legendary. But when Gorky&amp;#039;s marriage to Janice (Kathy Baker) begins to unravel and Chester is diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor leaving him only a few months to live, the pair decide to host one final party of unadulterated jazz in celebration of their love, friendship and music. The plan is to invite all of Gotham&amp;#039;s finest jazz musicians for a single night of bohemian rhapsody to farewell their glory days and for Gorky, a chance to embrace a new beginning.      \n\n\nSee &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107464/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107464/&lt;/a&gt;  for more information.         \n\n\nK E E P     S E E D I N G        \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caeae876edb59213fb1d24ad1b9745bc0204a409","amp;dn":"Lush+Life+1993+ENG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caeae876edb59213fb1d24ad1b9745bc0204a409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,234,232,118,237,181,146,19,251,29,36,173,27,151,69,188,2,4,164,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
