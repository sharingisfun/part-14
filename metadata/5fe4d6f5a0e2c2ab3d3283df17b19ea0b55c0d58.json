Hartsock made an appearance in the previous game and now we get to see the events from his point of view, based on actual events and persons.\n\nThough the game engine remains largely unchanged, the A.I. has been significantly improved to offer a more challenging experience as the player tries to advance through the treacherous area known as the Bocage. The player fights in first person as Hartsock but also commands either two fireteams or a fireteam and a tank as using cover and suppression fire is critical to success.\n\nThe game also offers an interesting multiplayer mode with the rare single-mission co-op option available for the PC, as well as skirmish maps and other mods such as &quot;Defense&quot;.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nIf Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.\n(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fe4d6f5a0e2c2ab3d3283df17b19ea0b55c0d58","amp;dn":"Brothers+In+Arms+-+Earned+In+Blood+%5BNTSC%5D+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fe4d6f5a0e2c2ab3d3283df17b19ea0b55c0d58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,228,214,245,160,226,194,171,61,50,131,223,23,177,158,160,181,92,13,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
