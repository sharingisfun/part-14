Pattern based music composition.\n\nProgrammable drum machine. \n\nElectrum has 8 sounds and you can program up to 32 patterns. A full sequencer allows you to string the patterns together into songs or longer beats. You can also play patterns &quot;live&quot;, switching them as the machine is playing.\n\nFor multitouch devices, Electrum has a multitouch pad dialog as well (See Menu-&gt;Play Multitouch pads) where you can play just like an MPC by hitting the pads.\n\nLATENCY OF THE MULTITOUCH PADS DEPENDS ON YOUR DEVICE. SOME DEVICES HAVE VERY BAD LAG RESPONSE. TESTED AS FAST: GALAXY TABLET, DROID X, DROID 1. KNOWN BAD: HTC DESIRE.\n\nHTC WILDFIRE IS TOO SLOW OF A DEVICE TO run Electrum effectively. Sorry, upgrade your device, it's just too slow (523Mhz only).\n\nPlease NOTE: The pads on the main screen are not designed to play real time because they are not multitouch. Use the multitouch pads for that. \n\nAlso check out my ReLoop music sequencer, which allows you to sequence loops just like Garageband or Sony's ACID.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n* WAV file import - Load YOUR OWN SAMPLES from SDCARD. Long press a sound button to bring up the sample loading dialog.\n\n* Use my Sonic Chop app (sold separate) to chop samples from MP3's on your device and load them right into Electrum!\n\n* Use samples and loops to make beats and songs. \n\n* Preview samples LIVE while the machine is playing, they will mix right into the beat.\n\n* Real time playback and editing - no waiting for sound to render before you hear your changes!\n\n* Look at the MENU for more options such as ability to save and load your own custom drumkits - once you've loaded the sounds you like unto the pads and adjusted them you can save the settings as a drumkit, separate from the patch itself!\n\n* RECORD samples with the microphone.\n\n* Stretch loops to fit the current project BPM.\n\n* Edit a sample's start and end point, pitch and pan Left/Right.\n\n* Use other time signatures such as 3/4, 6/8, etc.\n\n* Add some swing to your beats with the SHUFFLE setting.\n\n* Add Delay and Distortion FX to your samples\n\n* Sample accurate playback engine.\n\n* WAV/MIDI/Pad Export-load your song into Fruityloops!\n\n* Sharing - install the Soundcloud app from the market and you can share beats right to soundcloud (see Electrum's Menu-&gt;More-&gt;Share)\n\n\n* GET free sound Paks from http://www.nikotwenty.com/samples.htm if you downloaded the packs in *.zip extension just rename it to *.apk &quot;install&quot; it on your phone and and then &quot;uninstall&quot; to save space!\n \n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPHONE STATE/IDENTITY - used to stop playing if a phone call comes in. IDENTITY is NOT used for anything and it not read at all.\n\nSDCARD WRITE/READ - used to read sound files, and to save settings, patches, and drummkits\n\nWhat's in this version:\n\n4.5.5 - Fixed WAV export header bug which corrupted the wave file\n4.5.4 - Fixed some layouts that did not display correctly on Android 4.0 and Galaxy Nexus devices\n4.5.3 - Added advanced option to change path to the SDCARD that Electrum should use. Some devices have more than one sdcard (internal &amp; external) and this allows you to force Electrum to use a certain one. ADVANCED use only! See Menu-&gt;Change root sdcard path.\n\nEnjoy and Seed Please :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:870f2de639476bb736ac96ffbab0dfc1f5120b0d","amp;dn":"Electrum+Drum+Machine%2FSampler+Full+v4.5.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"870f2de639476bb736ac96ffbab0dfc1f5120b0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,15,45,230,57,71,107,183,54,172,150,255,186,176,223,193,245,18,11,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
