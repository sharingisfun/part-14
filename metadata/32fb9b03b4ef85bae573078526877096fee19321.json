But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop and the city's most dangerous drug lord, he panics and dumps his roach of Pineapple Express at the scene. Dale now has another reason to visit Saul: to find out if the weed is so rare that it can be traced back to him--and it is. As Dale and Saul run for their lives, they quickly discover that they're not suffering from weed-fueled paranoia: incredibly, the bad guys really are hot on their trail and trying to figure out the fastest way to kill them both. All aboard the Pineapple Express.\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime 117 minutes\n\nI personally thought this was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.\n\nI give it 9 out of 10\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32fb9b03b4ef85bae573078526877096fee19321","amp;dn":"Pineapple+Express+DvD+%282008%29+by+wolf003227","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32fb9b03b4ef85bae573078526877096fee19321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,251,155,3,180,239,133,186,229,115,7,133,38,135,112,150,254,225,147,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
