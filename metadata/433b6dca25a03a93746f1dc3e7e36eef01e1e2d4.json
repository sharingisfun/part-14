This applies especially to the second disc.\nIt's not recommended as a starting point for newcomers. They should better begin with one of Can's early studio albums.\nClearly for fans and completionists!\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nDisc one:\n   1. &quot;Jynx&quot; - 14th Oct 1975, Giessen, Universitaet  (16:06)\n   2. &quot;Dizzy Dizzy&quot; - 19th Nov 1975, Brighton, Sussex University  (8:02)\n   3. &quot;Vernal Equinox&quot; - 19th Nov 1975, Brighton, Sussex University  (12:44)\n   4. &quot;Fizz&quot; - 2nd Mar 1977, Keele, University of Keele  (6:27)\n   5. &quot;Yoo Doo Right&quot; - 4th May 1975, Croydon, Greyhound  (14:26)\n   6. &quot;Cascade Waltz&quot; - 23rd Mar 1977, London, Sound Circus  (4:48)\n\nDisc two:\n   1. &quot;Colchester Finale&quot; - including &quot;Halleluhwah&quot; 8th May 1972, Colchester, \n       University of Essex  (37:24)\n   2. &quot;Kata Kong&quot; - 21st Nov 1975, Hatfield, Hatfield Polytechnic  (8:28)\n   3. &quot;Spoon&quot; - 3rd Feb 1972, Cologne, Sporthalle  (14:23)\n\n\nPersonnel:\n    * Holger Czukay - bass (1972-1975); short wave radio, sampler &amp; electronic \n      treatments (1977)\n    * Michael Karoli - guitar, vocals\n    * Jaki Liebezeit - drums, percussion\n    * Irmin Schmidt - keyboards\n    * Damo Suzuki - vocals (1972 only)\n    * Rosko Gee - bass (1977 only)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:433b6dca25a03a93746f1dc3e7e36eef01e1e2d4","amp;dn":"Can+-+1999+-+Can+Box+Music+%28Live+1971-1977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"433b6dca25a03a93746f1dc3e7e36eef01e1e2d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,59,109,202,37,160,58,147,116,111,29,195,231,227,110,239,1,225,226,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
