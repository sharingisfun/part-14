I think it is the best Kubrick did visually so it should have been released ages ago.  People should see this with the best available image quality.\n\nThe file is a very good HDTV rip in PAL 25fps 1280 x 720 (192kps 5.1 surround).  There are other HD versions of this film available with a larger mkv file size but I have watched this one a couple of times and can say that the quality is superb without any degredation I can see.\n\nI have also included samples for people to check before downloading.  Thanks to copasetic for putting the work into making this available on the web. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42b5ec74c74aac8d93d70ae72d89de784c9edaf2","amp;dn":"Barry+Lyndon+HD+720p+x264+english","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42b5ec74c74aac8d93d70ae72d89de784c9edaf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,181,236,116,199,74,172,141,147,215,10,231,45,137,222,120,76,158,218,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
