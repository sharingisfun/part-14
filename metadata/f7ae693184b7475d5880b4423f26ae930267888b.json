Their highest charting single for the band was with the song &quot;Hey You&quot;, which reached #14.\n\nIn 1993, the Quireboys broke up but briefly reformed live in 1995 with different members. A more permanent reformation came in 2001 when frontman Spike, guitarist Guy Griffin and bassist Nigel Mogg put together a new line-up. The band is still active, recording new material and playing live. \n\n\n\nA Bit Of What You Fancy 1990\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;7 O'Clock&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Man On The Loose&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Whippin' Boy&quot;\n4.\t&quot;Sex Party&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Sweet Mary Ann&quot;\n6.\t&quot;I Don't Love You Anymore&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Hey You&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Misled&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Long Time Comin'&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Roses &amp; Rings&quot;\n11.\t&quot;There She Goes Again&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Take Me Home&quot;\n\n\n\nBitter Sweet &amp; Twisted 1993\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Tramps and Thieves&quot;\n2.\t&quot;White Trash Blues&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Can't Park Here&quot;\n4.\t&quot;King of New York&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Don't Bite the Hand&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Last Time&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Debbie&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Brother Louie&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Ode to You (Baby Just Walk)&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Hates to Please&quot;\n11.\t&quot;My Saint Jude&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Take No Revenge&quot;\n13.\t&quot;Wild, Wild, Wild&quot;\n14.\t&quot;Ain't Love Blind&quot;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7ae693184b7475d5880b4423f26ae930267888b","amp;dn":"The+London+Quireboys+-+2+Albums+1990+-+1993+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7ae693184b7475d5880b4423f26ae930267888b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,174,105,49,132,183,71,93,88,128,180,66,63,38,174,147,2,103,136,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
