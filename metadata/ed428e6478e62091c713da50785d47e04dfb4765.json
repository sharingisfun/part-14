The EXILE ON MAIN STREET references were still intact, but the predominant swagger and sashay had been abandoned in favour of a soulful interpretation of their roots, rather than a parody of their influences. Chris Robinson's Jagger pastiche was replaced by a more gutsy, honest strut, while brother Rich plays with an aplomb and spirit that struck darkly at the heart of their songs. A very grown-up record indeed.\nAll tracks have been digitally remastered.\nRecorded at Southern Tracks, Atlanta, Georgia.\nThe Black Crowes: Chris Robinson (vocals, harmonica, percussion); Rich Robinson, Marc Ford (guitar); Ed Harsch (piano, Hammond B-3 organ); Johnny Colt (bass); Steve Gorman (drums).\nAdditional personnel: Chris Trujillo (congas); Barbara, Taj (background vocals).Rolling Stone (6/25/92, p.40) - 3.5 Stars - Very Good - &quot;...nine new songs written by the Robinson brothers, filled with arresting chord changes, dynamic tempo shifts, snatches of feedback and other throwaway delights and just enough good lyrics to keep your ears tuned in...&quot;\nEntertainment Weekly (5/22/92, p.72) - &quot;...a frisky, straight-ahead rock &amp; roll positivism that runs so contrary to nearly everything else in the present singer-guitar-drums category that you can't help but like them...&quot;\n- Rating: B+\nQ (1/93, p.70) - Included in Q's list of the 50 Best Albums Of 1992.\nMusician (8/92, p.89) - &quot;...a simple, gut-busting pleasure....a hot and nasty collection of songs striking in their production and arrangement....one kickass album...&quot;\nVillage Voice (3/2/93, p.5) - Ranked #37 in the Village Voice's list of the 40 Best Albums Of 1992.  \n\n\nCategory  Rock/Pop, Live Performances, Hard Rock, Rock \nLabel  Legacy \nOrig Year  1992 \nAll Time Sales Rank    37213   \nCD Universe Part number  7536194 \nCatalog number  717682 \nDiscs  1 \nRelease Date  Nov 13, 2007 \nStudio/Live  Studio \nMono/Stereo  Stereo \nProducer  The Black Crowes; George Drakoulias \nEngineer  Brendan O'Brien \nPersonnel  Steve Gorman - drums\nMarc Ford - guitar\nChris Robinson - vocals, harmonica, percussion\nRich Robinson\nJohnny Colt - bass\nEd Harsch - piano, Hammond B-3 organ\n\nAlso: Chris Trujillo, Barbara, Taj \n\n\n 1.
