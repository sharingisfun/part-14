German CD reissue/release of LP material. Sound quality is very limited in dynamic range and response by modern standards. Although dated 1991, it sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s - on a portable cassette recorder from Radio Shack - in a cave - with the one microphone under a pillow.\n\nAround the World with Anton Karas (1997 - Switzerland) - a collection of mainly European tunes (with an interesting rendition of &quot;The River Kwai March&quot;). Fidelity here is good, in stereo.\n\nAnton Karas - a fairly modern recording (1991 - Japanese issue) of German, Austrian, and a few other European tunes, including the hit song from the film &quot;Never on Sunday.&quot;\n\nThe Third Man - Original Soundtrack (1949):  self-explanatory; from the British/American film starring Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, Alida Valli, Trevor Howard, and Ernst Deutsch :\n     \nFavorite quote from the film:\n&quot;In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder,  bloodshedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.&quot;  Harry Lime \n\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96cefd6ef474c224a97adfb573c1552d8b5df857","amp;dn":"Anton+Karas+Collection+-+4+CDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96cefd6ef474c224a97adfb573c1552d8b5df857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,206,253,110,244,116,194,36,169,122,223,181,115,193,85,45,139,93,248,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
