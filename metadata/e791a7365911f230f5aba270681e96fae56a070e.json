When I first wrote the book, being the first one in the field, just after first exam based on new pattern, I do realize it had questions, which were difficult and not really suitable for PLAB. Over time, we have learnt more about GMC questioning style and topics of interest and importance. We have tried our best to add on the relevant questions and change the previous ones to make this book an essential read for all PLAB aspirants. First time (beginner aspirants) as well as those who have been prepairing already will find the handbook equally useful. We are quite hopeful that the latter will find it of immense use for revision and refresh whatever they have read before. I do hope all of you enjoy the book, as much as we did revising it. We are as always open to candid comments from our readers.
