They are different though but both are excellent movies. ?Pixote? may be easier because it is a straightforward story. If you like ?Cidade de Deus? (City of god) then ?pixote is a choice. When you see ?Pixote? don?t forget about the socio-economical injustices in the world. It&amp;#039;s not only about street kids in Brazil.\n\nA few comment about ?Pixote? from IMDB and Jonathan Crow from allmovie.com\nabout the context of the movie  \n \n\nOne shocking movie about criminal children in Brazil, 9 August 200\nAuthor: iradao (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;dbb7aeb8baa89bb6baaea9b4b9beb5beadb2bfbea8f5b8b4b6f5b9a9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;) from Brasilia, Brazil\nThis movie has an outstanding acting, by Marilia PÃƒÂªra, and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian movie ever made. The movie was filmed with child from the &amp;#039;favelas&amp;#039; , the brazilian ghetos. The children weren&amp;#039;t actors and were casted by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison, that looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in Brazil it does happen till today. A must see for those who like violent movies. But take your mother off the room, because it is a hard movie.\n\n\nHorror, 16 March 200\nAuthor: Anakitsuke Hidetora from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n&quot;Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco&quot; deals with what is perhaps the greatest of all Brazilian themes: poverty. And along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder.\n\nBrazil is the country of paradoxes, and its social problems are present everywhere. The difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the most profound human decay.\n\n&quot;Pixote&quot; is one of the films that dare to touch and open these so painful wounds, and does it without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrayal of a country that, like Pixote himself, is already lost. \n\n\nA movie that reflects our dead society, 12 June 1999\nAuthor: Carlitos from Guatemala, Guatemala\nPixote made me reflect because it deals with something one sees in an every day basis. Its contents, though sometimes rude to see, are settled in a natural way, since the world sees all what is happening to Pixote as &quot;natural&quot;. Nothing more cruel. After seeing Pixote you cannot go on the streets and ignore the so called \n&quot;boys of the streets&quot;. \n\n\n\nNot since Luis BuÃƒÂ±uel&amp;#039;s Los Olvidados has there been as savage and harrowing account of the plight of street kids or as damning a critique of Third World poverty and societal indifference. 10-year-old Pixote (&quot;Pee Wee&quot; in Portuguese) endures the brutalities of Brazil&amp;#039;s repressive, corrupt reform schools, where military death squads and juvenile prison rape are the norm, only to flee to the dubious freedom of Sao Paolo&amp;#039;s streets. Soon Pixote becomes a pimp, thief, and multiple murderer. Yet, through it all, the audience never loses sympathy for Pixote; director Hector Babenco makes clear that all Pixote wants and needs is a stable loving person in his life. Babenco&amp;#039;s work is in the same spirit as the 1940s Italian Neorealists who coupled a realist style with a keen sense of social injustice. His visual style is documentary-like and almost artless?a straightforward depiction of events. His true artistic feat lies in his handling of his actors, most of whom were street kids in real life. The performance he gets out of amateur Fernando Ramos da Silva is astonishing. Not since Jean-Pierre LÃƒÂ©aud&amp;#039;s performance in The 400 Blows (1959) had a child actor delivered a performance so filled with sadness and pathos. Da Silva&amp;#039;s large eyes, set off by his round baby face, speak of someone who has seen too much too soon. Pixote is a raw, heart-wrenching experience that will burn into the viewer&amp;#039;s mind for a long time to come. ?
