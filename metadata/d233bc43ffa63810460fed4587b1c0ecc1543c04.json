Lustig - Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity, and Disease\nHudson Street Press, 2012\n\nRobert Lustig's 90-minute YouTube video 'Sugar: The Bitter Truth', has been viewed more than three million times. Now, in this much anticipated book, he documents the science and the politics that has led to the pandemic of chronic disease over the last 30 years.\n\n'No scientist has done more in the last fifty years to alert Americans to the potential dangers of sugar in the diet than Dr. Robert Lustig.'\nGary Taubes, author of 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' and 'Why We Get Fat'\n\n---\nThe book comes in both epub, mobi and pdf format.
