Thanks go to .BONE. for his collection to make this conversion project possible.\n\nAll files:\n\n- support any Apple device out there today (.m4v format)\n- used -profile:v high -level 4.0 with ffmpeg to encode\n- are tagged with meta data, as you can see below\n- have embedded cover art from IMDB\n\nQuality is based on the original compilation and wasn't really changed much by the encoding process (at least I don't think...I didn't exactly watch every single one of these). Only a format change happened to the files. Please no complaints about the low resolution of the older videos. If you have a DVD of the movie, feel free to re-encode it and upload it as a separate torrent.\n\nPlease seed. I'd love to see it stay up. Thanks!\n\nThe original collection was in .avi format, so they couldn't be used with Apple TV, iTunes, or any iOS device easily. This collection is now native, and supports the following specs:\n\n$ ffmpeg -i Wall-E (2008).m4v \nffmpeg version 2.1.4 Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the FFmpeg developers\n  built on Mar 25 2014 20:38:01 with Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.38) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)\n  configuration: --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/2.1.4_1 --enable-shared --enable-pthreads --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --enable-nonfree --enable-hardcoded-tables --enable-avresample --enable-vda --cc=clang --host-cflags= --host-ldflags= --enable-libx264 --enable-libfaac --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libxvid\n  libavutil      52. 48.101 / 52. 48.101\n  libavcodec     55. 39.101 / 55. 39.101\n  libavformat    55. 19.104 / 55. 19.104\n  libavdevice    55.  5.100 / 55.  5.100\n  libavfilter     3. 90.100 /  3. 90.100\n  libavresample   1.  1.  0 /  1.  1.  0\n  libswscale      2.  5.101 /  2.  5.101\n  libswresample   0. 17.104 /  0. 17.104\n  libpostproc    52.  3.100 / 52.  3.100\n[mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2 @ 0x7fd41a004a00] stream 0, timescale not set\nInput #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'Wall-E (2008).m4v':\n  Metadata:\n    major_brand     : isom\n    minor_version   : 512\n    compatible_brands: isomiso2avc1mp41\n    title           : Wall-E\n    artist          : Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, Fred Willard, MacInTalk\n    comment         : \n    genre           : Kids &amp; Family\n    date            : 2008-6-27T09:00:00Z\n    show            : \n    network         : \n    episode_id      : \n    description     : WALL-E, Pixar's latest film, is about a robot named WALL-E (or 'Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth-Class'), who is the only thing left on earth with some sort of emotion.
