This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\n\n\nNightranger has their first hit in this countdown, &quot;Don't Tell Me You Love Me&quot; at number 40, and the first top 40 hit for Sammy Hagar is at number 13, &quot;Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy.&quot;\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What has been the largest family act ever to hit the top 40?&quot; Casey says it was an act that had 6 brothers and 4 sisters and hit number one with their song, &quot;Boogie Fever.&quot;\n\n&quot;Der Kommissar&quot; by After The Fire is at number 31. It is a song written by Falco, who would take his single &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot; all the way to number one in 1985.\n\nThere is a song from an LP that set a new record concerning most weeks at number one for a debut album. Casey says the previous record holder (for over 20 years) was Bob Newhart.\n\nMusical Youth is at number 10 with their song &quot;Pass The Dutchie.&quot; It contains the following lines:\n\n&quot;This generation rules the nation with version&quot;\n&quot;As I pass the dreadlocks' camp&quot;\n&quot;Cause the spirit of Jah, you know, He leads you on&quot;\n&quot;Give me little music, make me wind up me waist&quot;\n\nCasey explains their meaning.\n\nThis is the 5th out of 10 consecutive weeks (from February 5th to April 16th) that &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot; and &quot;Do You Really Want To Hurt Me&quot; were back to back in the American Top 40 countdown no matter what their positions.\n\nOnly three acts have ever been able to hold the number one spot on the pop, soul, and album charts at the same time (Sly, Donna, and Ray), until this countdown.
