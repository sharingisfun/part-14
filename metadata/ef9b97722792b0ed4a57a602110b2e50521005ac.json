They test their knowledge of the week's dumbest news against some of the best and brightest in the news and entertainment world. Host Peter Sagal and scorekeeper (and veteran NPR newscaster) Carl Kasell join panelists including author and humorist Roy Blount Jr., Washington Post columnist Roxanne Roberts, Boston Globe writer Charlie Pierce, and comedian Paula Poundstone.\n\n  Always a high point of the show, the &quot;Not My Job!&quot; segment features a celebrity guest who must answer three questions on a topic totally outside his or her area of expertise. Nice guy Tom Hanks is asked about Hollywood's biggest louts. Magician Penn Jillette can't escape three questions about Ben Franklin. Jeopardy Grand Champion Ken Jennings is almost (but not quite) stumped by &quot;What in the world does Ken Jennings not know?&quot; And Barack Obama, Democratic Senator from Illinois, takes \nthe floor for three questions about the superstitions of Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs.\n\n  Introduced by Sagal, with hilarious interjections from panel members, the first-ever Wait Wait audio is fast paced, funnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and oddly informative.\n\n&quot;This is one of those audio experiences you can't turn off and that holds up after multiple listenings.&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½AudioFile\n\n\nWait Wait Don't Tell Me is a co-production of NPR and Chicago Public Radio.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef9b97722792b0ed4a57a602110b2e50521005ac","amp;dn":"Wait+Wait...+Don%5C%27t+Tell+Me%21+The+Best+of+Not+My+Job+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef9b97722792b0ed4a57a602110b2e50521005ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,155,151,114,39,146,176,237,74,87,166,2,17,11,46,80,82,16,5,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
