Johnson takes a look at her lifelong obsession with &quot;casting on&quot; as she chronicles her journey from a crudely self-taught, left-handed beginner to one of the world?s most prolific knitters?not to mention premier knitting bloggers. From the virtues of learning how to knit the perfect sock, to the compulsive need to stash exquisite skeins of yarn in every crevice of one?s home, this is the perfect book for every knitter. Wendy also offers tips for avoiding errors, thoughts on knitting gifts for others, and more than twenty original patterns for knitters of every level of expertise: from the ridiculous and irreverent (a cell phone cozy) to the absolutely sublime (your very own luxurious Nordic style pullover).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce0418fe817b3328282656e88b80bfaf19591679","amp;dn":"Wendy+Knits+%3A+My+Never-Ending+Adventures+in+Yarn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce0418fe817b3328282656e88b80bfaf19591679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,4,24,254,129,123,51,40,40,38,86,232,139,128,191,175,25,89,22,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
