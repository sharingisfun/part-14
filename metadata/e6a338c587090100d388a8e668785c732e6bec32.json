Citing influences as diverse as Etta James, Jill Scott, Bjork, Dusty Springfield,\nBilly Bragg, Billie Holiday, Jeff Buckley, The Cure and Peggy Lee, Adele is a truly unique new artist. With her mix up of R&amp;B and soul served up with a healthy dash of feisty London attitude, she spins beautiful dark stories of loves won and lost and sometimes just daydreamed about. Features the classic tracks Chasing Pavements and Hometown Glory as well as a cover of Bob Dylan s Make You Feel My Love.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic. HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Daydreamer                                           [03:41]\n02.Best for last                                        [04:19]\n03.Chasing pavements                                    [03:31]\n04.Cold shoulder                                        [03:12]\n05.Crazy for you                                        [03:28]\n06.Melt my heart to stone                               [03:24]\n07.First love                                           [03:10]\n08.Right as rain                                        [03:17]\n09.Make you feel my love                                [03:32]\n10.My same                                              [03:16]\n11.Tired                                                [04:19]\n12.Hometown glory                                       [04:31]\n____\n\n43:40 min\n 56,9 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.  You know who you are. We'd like to send another special Greetz to our dear RIAA snitcher David Brooks from Devon.\nWhat did you tell them? That HHI is dropping rips like LSD? Call us crazy...We think they might be aware of our existance already. It's not nice to snitch. Especially stupid doing it to people like us. Here's our doc drop dedicated to you. We're sure the information looks familiar, as it's yours. Have a nice day, snitch. :)\n\nDavid Brooks BD ~BD~ BoaterDave\nJersey Cottage\n86 Granary Lane\nBudleigh Salterton\nDevon\nEX9 6ER\nUnited Kingdom\nPhone: 44-1395-443340\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6a338c587090100d388a8e668785c732e6bec32","amp;dn":"Adele-19-%28Retail%29-2008-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6a338c587090100d388a8e668785c732e6bec32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,163,56,197,135,9,1,0,211,136,168,230,104,120,92,115,46,107,236,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
