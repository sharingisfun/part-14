HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s haunted by fragments of a dream.\nHe envisages a journey.  A celestial city, a great cathedral, and a figure roped to a steeple, about to fallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\nIt is Cumbria 1348, the year of the Black Death. A medieval mining village lives in fear of the advancing plague. GriffinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s older brother Connor returns from the outside world in a state of despair, until Griffin tells of his dream and reveals their only source of survival:\nMake tribute to God. Place a spire on a distant cathedral. Do so before dawn or the village will be lost.\nGriffin embarks on an extraordinary journey with Connor, Searle the pragmatist, SearleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s naive brother Ulf, Martin the philosopher and Arno the one-handed ferryman. In his vision together they tunnel through the paper thin earth to a new world, a fabled land of hellish extremes, unfamiliar as the distant future of the antipodes, 1988.\nBut Griffin has a chilling new premonitionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ for one of them, the journey will end.\n\nGood, but not outstanding, quality.\n\nScreenshot: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaLDDaAci&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaLDDaAci&lt;/a&gt;\n\n***** SPANISH SUBS NOT HARDCODED !! *****\nThey're in a separate file, just delete it if you don't want them.\n\nI will keep this torrent alive, but my upload speed is utterly slow, so please help your fellow downloaders by seeding as long as you can. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c58e0ca442d8e4a1b354bb289cc80ed3047a341","amp;dn":"the+navigator+-+a+medieval+odyssey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c58e0ca442d8e4a1b354bb289cc80ed3047a341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,88,224,202,68,45,142,74,27,53,75,178,137,204,128,237,48,71,163,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
