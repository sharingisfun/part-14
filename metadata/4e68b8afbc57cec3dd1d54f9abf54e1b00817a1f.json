With many recent developments in their management, it is merciful that they can now be treated with non-invasive physical methods. The notion of\nadverse neural mechanics has been present for many years and probably longer than we know. Wittingly or unwittingly, the first known description of a neurodynamic test was on the Edwin Smith Papyrus by Imhotep in 2800 BC, in which a leg straightening\nmanoeuvre was performed in the diagnosis of low back pain in workers injured whilst building the Egyptian pyramids (Beasley 1982; Dyck 1984). However, between then and now, much has happened and it is fascinating to note that, in addition to the neurodynamic tests for the lower quarter, the three major tests for the upper limb nerves (median, radial and ulnar) had been documented and illustrated pictorially by the 1920s and 1950s (Bragard 1929; Von Lanz &amp; Wachsmuth 1959). Their antitension counterpart postures were also illustrated next to these neurodynamic tests.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e68b8afbc57cec3dd1d54f9abf54e1b00817a1f","amp;dn":"Shacklock+2005+Clinical+Neurodynamics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e68b8afbc57cec3dd1d54f9abf54e1b00817a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,104,184,175,188,87,206,195,221,29,84,249,171,245,78,27,0,129,122,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
