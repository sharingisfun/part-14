With much fanfare a new government agency was formed with a mandate &quot;to prevent and protect&quot;. Its official title: The Federal Bureau of Physics. Humans, if nothing else, adapt to the changing parameters of their existence. What was extraordinary soon became ordinary, a part of peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daily lives. They move on and do what people have always done: survive. But even that new status quo is now under threat. Things are getting worse, and it falls to Special Agent Adam Hardy and his FBP team to figure out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on, before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late...\n\nWith issue #2, this series has been renamed FBP: Federal Bureau of Physics.\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru and theProletariat for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
