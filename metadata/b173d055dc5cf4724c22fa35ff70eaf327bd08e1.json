After presenting the scope of the problem, the first major part of the book is devoted to genetics and pathophysiology, the second part of the book presents the public health perspective of the most prevalent problems associated with nutrition and the metabolic syndrome, whereas the third major part of the book focuses on clinical assessment and management of the main disease states associated with inappropriate nutrition and the metabolic syndrome. Finally, general information useful for both clinicians and researchers alike is presented in the Appendix. Nutrition and Metabolism: Underlying Mechanisms and Clinical Consequences offers the reader an up-to-date and authoritative review of the major scientific and clinical aspects of the overlapping areas between nutrition and metabolism.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 448 pages\n# Publisher: Humana Press; 1 edition (June 18, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1603274529\n# ISBN-13: 978-1603274524","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b173d055dc5cf4724c22fa35ff70eaf327bd08e1","amp;dn":"Nutrition+and+Metabolism%2C1st+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b173d055dc5cf4724c22fa35ff70eaf327bd08e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,115,208,85,220,92,244,114,76,34,250,53,255,112,234,243,39,189,8,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
