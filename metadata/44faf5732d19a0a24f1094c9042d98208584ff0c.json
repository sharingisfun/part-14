The film was released 2 years before his tragic death.\n\nStory is set in 1963, before some friends are shipped to Vietnam. They play a dirty game called 'Dogfight': All of them seek a woman for a party, and who finds the most ugly one, wins a prize. But games may turn around...\n\nThis is not my rip; I found it on another site using PirateBay's tracker, so I thought it should be represented here.\n\nWidescreen 608x336, good stereo sound.\n\nWarning: MediaInfo refuses to give an accurate analysis of the picture size for this rip. It runs well in WMP on the computer and in one of my standalone DivX players, but is refused by the other standalone player. Run it through Dr. DivX or some other program if you have to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44faf5732d19a0a24f1094c9042d98208584ff0c","amp;dn":"Dogfight+%281991%29+River+Phoenix+%28DVDrip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44faf5732d19a0a24f1094c9042d98208584ff0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,250,245,115,45,25,160,162,79,16,148,201,4,45,152,32,133,132,255,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
