The follow-up release to Rust Never Sleeps, the album moves away from the power chords to an acoustic base. The album clocks in at less than a half an hour with most of the nine songs at under three minutes. The original album was broken up into two sides, the first side acoustic and the second side with a full country band. &quot;The Old Homestead&quot; is a rambling track with some of the most mysterious lyrics of Mr. Young's career. It's tough to get a sense of where he's going with the song, but it is intriguing none-the-less. &quot;Lost In Space&quot; is the a truly bizarre track complete with vocals from the marine munchkins. &quot;Captain Kennedy&quot; is a the stand-out track on the album. A dark and foreboding song about a young soldier heading to war. While he's on the water approaching shore he remembers his father who was shamed in battle by having the wooden schooner he captained blown up by the Germans. As he's done remembering his father he hopes his fates are different when reaches the shore and he hopes he can kill good. The song is one of Mr. Young's all-time best. The songs with the country band are filled with fiddles and hooting and hollering like a real hoe-down. &quot;Union Man&quot; is funny and the best of the bunch. Hawks &amp; Doves was generally spurned by critics and the public, but it is a fine example of how Neil Young marches to the beat of his own drummer and isn't afraid to follow wherever his muse takes him.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:049c1708a866cf04018a1d6f825c554cf35acf46","amp;dn":"Neil+Young...Hawks+%26amp%3B+Doves%281980%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"049c1708a866cf04018a1d6f825c554cf35acf46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,156,23,8,168,102,207,4,1,138,29,111,130,92,85,76,243,90,207,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
