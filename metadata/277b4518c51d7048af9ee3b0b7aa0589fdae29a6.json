The MÃƒÂ©tis leader who fought for the rights of his people against an encroaching tide of white settlers helped establish the province of Manitoba before escaping to the United States. Gabriel Dumont was a successful hunter and MÃƒÂ©tis chief, a man tested by warfare, a pragmatist who differed from the devout Riel. Giller PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€winning novelist Joseph Boyden argues that Dumont, part of a delegation that had sought out Riel in exile, may not have foreseen the impact on the MÃƒÂ©tis cause of bringing Riel home. While making rational demands of Sir John A. Macdonald's government, Riel seemed increasingly overtaken by a messianic mission. His execution in 1885 by the Canadian government still reverberates today. Boyden provides fresh, controversial insight into these two seminal Canadian figures and how they shaped the country.\n\n\nThree Day Road\nSet in Canada and the battlefields of France and Belgium, Three-Day Road is a mesmerizing novel told through the eyes of NiskaÃ¢â‚¬â€a Canadian Oji-Cree woman living off the land who is the last of a line of healers and divinersÃ¢â‚¬â€and her nephew Xavier.\n\nAt the urging of his friend Elijah, a Cree boy raised in reserve schools, Xavier joins the war effort. Shipped off to Europe when they are nineteen, the boys are marginalized from the Canadian soldiers not only by their native appearance but also by the fine marksmanship that years of hunting in the bush has taught them. Both become snipers renowned for their uncanny accuracy. But while Xavier struggles to understand the purpose of the war and to come to terms with his conscience for the many lives he has ended, Elijah becomes obsessed with killing, taking great risks to become the most accomplished sniper in the army. Eventually the harrowing and bloody truth of war takes its toll on the two friends in different, profound ways. Intertwined with this account is the story of Niska, who herself has borne witness to a lifetime of deathÃ¢â‚¬â€the death of her people.\n\nIn part inspired by the legend of Francis Pegahmagabow, the great Indian sniper of World War I, Three-Day Road is an impeccably researched and beautifully written story that offers a searing reminder about the cost of war.\n\n\nKikwaakew\nTwenty-five years after the war of Three Day Road, Joseph Boyden revisits Xavier Bird, who looks to his sons to help defeat an old foe on the trap lines. Kikwaakew first appeared in the July/August 2012 issue of The Walrus magazine.\n\n\n\nThrough Black Spruce_ A Novel\nBeautifully written and startlingly original, Through Black Spruce takes the considerable talents of Canadian novelist Joseph Boyden to new and exciting heights. This is the story of two immensely compelling characters: Will Bird, a legendary Cree bush pilot who lies comatose in a remote Ontario hospital; and Annie Bird, Will's niece, a beautiful loner and trapper who has come to sit beside her uncle's bed. Broken in different ways, the two take silent communion in their unspoken kinship, revealing a story rife with heartbreak, fierce love, ancient feuds, mysterious disappearances, murders, and the bonds that hold a family, and a people, together. From the rugged Canadian wilderness to the drug-fueled glamour of the Manhattan club scene, this is thrilling, atmospheric storytelling at its finest.[/code]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:277b4518c51d7048af9ee3b0b7aa0589fdae29a6","amp;dn":"4+Books+by+Joseph+Boyden+epub+and+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"277b4518c51d7048af9ee3b0b7aa0589fdae29a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,123,69,24,197,29,112,72,175,158,227,176,183,170,5,137,253,174,41,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
