This has led to widespread interest in using natural materialsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½straw, cob, and earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for building homes and other buildings that are inexpensive, and that rely largely on labor rather than expensive and often environmentally-damaging outsourced materials.\n\nEarthbag Building is the first comprehensive guide to all the tools, tricks, and techniques for building with bags filled with earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or earthbags. Having been introduced to sandbag construction by the renowned Nader Khalili in 1993, the authors developed this &quot;Flexible Form Rammed Earth Technique&quot; over the last decade. A reliable method for constructing homes, outbuildings, garden walls and much more, this enduring, tree-free architecture can also be used to create arched and domed structures of great beautyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in any region, and at home, in developing countries, or in emergency relief work.\n\nThis profusely illustrated guide first discusses the many merits of earthbag construction, and then leads the reader through the key elements of an earthbag building:\nSpecial design considerations\nFoundations, walls and floors\nElectrical, plumbing and shelving\nLintels, windows and door installations\nRoofs, arches and domes\nExterior and interior plasters.\n\nWith dedicated sections on costs, making your own specialized tools, and building code considerations, as well as a complete resources guide, Earthbag Building is the long-awaited, definitive guide to this uniquely pleasing construction style.\n\nKaki Hunter and Donald Kiffmeyer have been involved in the construction industry for the last 20 years, specializing in affordable, low-tech, low-impact building methods that are as natural as possible. They developed the &quot;Flexible Form Rammed Earth Technique&quot; of building affordably with earthbags and have taught the subject and contributed their expertise to several books and journals on natural building.\n\n\n# Paperback: 288 pages\n# Publisher: New Society Publishers (June 1, 2004)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0865715076\n# ISBN-13: 978-0865715073","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29d897834b82880e262f3479a9dfeec38ba57f6","amp;dn":"Earthbag+Building%3A+The+Tools%2CTricks+and+Techniques+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29d897834b82880e262f3479a9dfeec38ba57f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,157,137,120,52,184,40,128,226,98,243,71,154,157,254,236,56,186,87,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
