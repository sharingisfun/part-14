We took all of what we learned in the development of our Olympic Symphonic Choirs Ã¢â‚¬â€ Mars and Venus Ã¢â‚¬â€ and designed our most powerful yet easy-to-use choir library yet.\n\nThere is a special sound to a traditional English boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choral ensemble Ã¢â‚¬â€ solemn lows, angelic highs and an overwhelming innocence that harkens back to the days of youth and purity. With Mercury, we managed to capture this unique quality as we painstakingly sampled a full boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choral ensemble (ages 8-13) in the same large crystal-clear hall in which we recorded our Olympus choirs. More specifications are coming soon but Mercury will feature 42 staccatos &amp; 42 sustaining marcatos all with deep round-robin and stacking/layering options, 18 tempo-syncing Latin poly-syllabic sustains with phrase-synchronus polyphonic legato, unique fff poly-staccatos, 6 dynamic true legato vowels (ah, oh, oo, eh, ee, mm) with real-time speed control from fluid to tight, plus a classic ensemble whistle legato. It also includes drone and whispering chants, staccatos and sutains, trills, sweeps, swells and other choral effects. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also find two exquisite soloists (younger soprano and older alto), each with a wide range of poly-syllabic phrases, staccatos and a fluid true legato vowel sustain for each.\n\nKONTAKT 5 and Above - IF YOU CAN'T OPEN PLEASE UPGRADE YOUR KONTAKT VERSION\n\n- Extract the contents\n- Open your latest Kontakt\n- Go to Libraries tab\n- Click add library\n- Select the directory/folder that you downloaded at.\n- On Win user, just Yes or Accept when prompted to add libary.\n- Mac user, read www.native-instruments.com/en/support/knowledge-base/show/794/\n(Except WITHOUT the key or serial part!)\n- The added library will show up on the left panel.\n\n\nUse DAEMON Tools Pro to mount, open the ISO then extract the library.\n\nDownload here\n\nthepiratebay.se/torrent/782964","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7add6c81a72cee90dd5d72ca2c50197a550e15e","amp;dn":"Soundiron+-+Mercury+Boys+Choir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7add6c81a72cee90dd5d72ca2c50197a550e15e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,173,214,200,26,114,206,233,13,213,215,44,162,197,1,151,165,80,225,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
