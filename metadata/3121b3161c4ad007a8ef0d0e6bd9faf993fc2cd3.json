Buster Keaton is at his best throughout the movie as is Jack Gillford who we see later in the Cocoon Movies. Zero Mostell is at the top of his game as is Phil Silvers.\nIt is a roller coaster of comedy from start to finish. Mel Brooks designed his comedies on the format of this movie to create Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein.
