It aired at the 9:30 pm (E/P)/8:30 pm (C) timeslot after The X Factor. The series stars Jaime Pressly and Katie Finneran. On May 10, 2012, Fox canceled the series.\nThe series followed two mothers who fear their daughters are turning into the kind of girls who tormented them in high school. The fears would come quickly when Annie Watson (Jaime Pressly), who grew up in an ultra-strict conservative family, begins to notice that she has allowed her daughter Sophie (Kristi Lauren) to do what she wants to do, which she takes advantage of by embarrassing and mocking her mother, while best friend Nikki Miller (Katie Finneran), who grew up unpopular and overweight and has reinvented herself as a Southern Belle, begins to notice how manipulative her daughter Mackenzie (Aisha Dee) has become. Even the ex-husbands are not very good fathers: Annie's ex Matt is too clueless, prompting his lawyer brother Jack (Kevin Rahm) to step in (and become an object of Annie's crush) while Nikki's ex Gary is letting their complicated relationship become more complicated in the parenting department. These situations are among the major challenges Annie and Nikki must face to keep the daughters from turning into the people they were afraid of when they were their daughters' age.\n\nFile Types: Mkv\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nResolution: 1276x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChanels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\nOfficial Website:\n \n\nIMDb link:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1819545/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1819545/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29eb4b76d5c4eaa0107f3edd08dfd13476aa86f3","amp;dn":"I+Hate+My+Teenage+Daughter+Season+1+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29eb4b76d5c4eaa0107f3edd08dfd13476aa86f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,235,75,118,213,196,234,160,16,127,62,221,8,223,209,52,118,170,134,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
