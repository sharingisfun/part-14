I converted them to .mobi using calibre, which means some have weird formatting issues.  Mostly readable.\n\nThe criteria used to select these books were having won a huge/nebula on the sci-fi top 100 list on sffjazz, or being part of a series where one of the books in the series is on the aforementioned lists.  also a few miscellaneous items of note.  Very few if any truly low quality content in this torrent, I originally made this collection to replace my physical collection :)\n\nIf you know of a place to get better mobi or epub conversions of some of these books let me know in the comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d869073b0c6eaaabbdb07e35abbbb35c1ed6ed5","amp;dn":"Sci-Fi%2FFantasy+library+in+.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d869073b0c6eaaabbdb07e35abbbb35c1ed6ed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,134,144,115,176,198,234,170,187,219,7,227,90,187,187,53,193,237,110,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
