(Later, in deference to the new Italian fashion of basso continuo, a viol was added to the lute). Undoubtedly\nthe ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¡owering of English poetry in late Elizabethan times contributed to the lute song, as German lyric poetry from the late\neighteenth century onwards contributed to the birth of the German Lied. In the lutenistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s case the poetry was frequently much\nmore closely associated with the music, for sometimes poet and composer were one and the same person (Campion certainly was, and\nDowland seems likely to have been).\n\n\nAPE (image+.cue)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6125f443fd22ff28ce5212dbe4fc5fe1dff17240","amp;dn":"Elizabethan+Lute+Songs+-+Peter+Pears+and+Julian+Bream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6125f443fd22ff28ce5212dbe4fc5fe1dff17240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,37,244,67,253,34,255,40,206,82,18,219,228,252,95,225,223,241,114,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
