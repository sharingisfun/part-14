Seventeen-year-old music hall seamstress Kitty Peck finds herself reluctantly drawn into a web of blackmail, depravity and murder when The Lady devises a singular scheme to discover the truth. \n\nBut as Kitty's scandalous and terrifying act becomes the talk of London, she finds herself facing someone even more deadly and horrifying than The Lady.\nBold, impetuous and blessed with more brains than she cares to admit, it soon becomes apparent that it's up to the unlikely team of Kitty and her stagehand friend, Lucca, to unravel the truth and ensure that more girls do not meet with a similar fate. \n\nBut are Kitty's courage and common sense and Lucca's book learning a match for the monster in the shadows? Their investigations take them from the gin-fuelled halls and doss houses of the East End to the champagne-fuelled galleries of the West End.\nTake nothing at face value: Kitty is about to step out on a path of discovery that changes everything\n\nGenre: Historical fiction | Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf2c16edeb809fa2e759704b20159cc3ee3ef9ab","amp;dn":"Kitty+Peck+and+the+Music+Hall+Murders+by+K.+Griffin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf2c16edeb809fa2e759704b20159cc3ee3ef9ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,44,22,237,235,128,159,162,231,89,112,75,32,21,156,195,238,62,249,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
