King Gilgamesh, ruler of the kingdom Uruk, uses the appearance of demons as an excuse to invade the tower and find out the construct's secrets. As 80 years passed, the Uruk army managed to fight back the demons and built a fortress city and safe haven on the very first floor of Druaga - Metz Kier. Thus begins the story of a warrior named Gil who, finding companions along the way, embarks on a quest for the fabled Blue Crystal Rod, a powerful artifact rumored to be in the highest floor of Druaga. However, other competitors, including the kingdom of Uruk itself, want the treasure, all for their own reasons.\n\nSpecs\nVideo:720x480 anamorphic 16:9 VFR H.264 1274 KBit/s\n\nAudio:\njapanese normal audio 2.0 Stereo AC3 (192 kBit/s)\nenglish normal audio 5.1 Surround AC3 (448 kBit/s)\n\nSubs:\nEnglish VOBSUBS with separate track for signs/songs\nEnglish SRT with separate track for signs/subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ca2896903cedae4cb7dc8520160d3ee91c87e2","amp;dn":"%09%5BExiled-Destiny%5D+The+Tower+of+DRUAGA+-the+Aegis+of+URUK+Dual+Au","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ca2896903cedae4cb7dc8520160d3ee91c87e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,202,40,150,144,60,237,174,76,183,220,133,32,22,13,62,233,28,135,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
