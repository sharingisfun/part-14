Commonly classified as hard rock or blues rock, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always classified their music as simply &quot;rock and roll&quot;. To date they are one of the highest-grossing bands of all time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n In 1986, the group returned to the charts with the made-for-radio &quot;Who Made Who&quot;. The album Who Made Who was the soundtrack to Stephen King's film Maximum Overdrive, It brought together older hits, such as &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; and &quot;Ride On&quot;, with newer songs such as title track &quot;Who Made Who&quot;, and two new instrumentals, &quot;D.T.&quot; and &quot;Chase the Ace&quot;.\n\nIn February 1988, AC/DC were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association's Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:459877883ae9534b8e9fd7c0b2a61bc3539d9685","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+Who+Made+Who+%5B1986%5D%5B2008%5D%5BJapan+Remaster%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"459877883ae9534b8e9fd7c0b2a61bc3539d9685","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,152,119,136,58,233,83,75,142,159,215,192,178,166,27,195,83,157,150,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
