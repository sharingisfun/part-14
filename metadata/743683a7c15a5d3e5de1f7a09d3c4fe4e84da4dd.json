They made their breakthrough only with their previous, third album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Divine ConspiracyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ not because they suddenly became a great band, which they always were, but mostly due to the fact that they were promoted by the currently biggest heavy metal record company. These are the signs of our times, but even with such a push you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go very far without being worth of it.\nAnd EPICA come with a huge album like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDesign Your UniverseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to claim the throne of what is called (misleadingly in my humble opinion) female fronted metal. This term says nothing - Sabina Classen or Angela Gossow that are frontwomen as Simone Simons, but the music that accompanies them is some worlds apart from the mythical world that Simons can travel you with her voice.\nIf you like your music with labels, then what EPICA play is progressive symphonic metal and they sure know how to deliver it. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDesign Your UniverseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ continues in the same spirit as its predecessor only with even grander and more epic songs. Jansen shows that his capabilities in writing big compositions that can combine operatic vocals, growls, Gregorian chants, symphonic parts, death outbreaks, piano interludes (and the list goes on) hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t reached its peak. He is the maestro keeping the equilibrium among all those elements and the outcome shines bright, a fact that should also be granted to producer Sascha Paeth (Angra, Kamelot, Rhapsody, Avantasia) as well, who is a master in making power metal albums find their way. As for Simone Simons there is not much to say. She is a girl that could sing only with her image (you already knew that, didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you?), but her mezzo soprano voice and her alto outbreaks leave no room for doubts about her capabilities. Just listen to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTides Of TimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a superb ballad, or the magnificent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOur DestinyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that has some incredible vocals before its outburst ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they will surely get you into their musical vision. As for the lyrics, this time they seem to touch more earthly issues like liberty and freedom which suits me better, hope it does the same for you. Whatever the lyrics are though, you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t escape the fairytale concept that band carries with them. What makes EPICA even more attractive is that they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t lack brutality despite their image and the presence of a woman behind the microphone. Jansen growls (not the best around, but fairly acceptable) and the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recent transfers, Isaac Delahaye/guitars and Arien Van Weesenbeek both from (God Dethroned) guarantee that death metal elements will haunt the majestic atmosphere.\nTheir live album that has just been released showed in the most emphatic tone that the band aims really high and beyond the typical heavy metal standards implementing choirs and symphonic orchestras in their music. EPICA is a band that progresses, evolves and becomes bigger with each attempt. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDesign Your UniverseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a complete album in all aspects that gets hold of you the more you listen to it. It is a step forward for the band and if ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDivine ConspiracyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ brought them ahead of many, then this one will establish their status and multiply their fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:743683a7c15a5d3e5de1f7a09d3c4fe4e84da4dd","amp;dn":"Epica+-+Design+Your+Universe+%282009%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"743683a7c15a5d3e5de1f7a09d3c4fe4e84da4dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,54,131,167,193,90,93,62,93,225,247,160,157,60,79,228,232,77,164,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
