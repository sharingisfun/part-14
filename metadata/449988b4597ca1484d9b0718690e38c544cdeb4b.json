It is time to prepare for what has yet to come in these last days. They say it is time to pray....\n\nIN THE MEADOW  (In Print August 2010)\n\nDawn McKensie, who is living a dead end existence in Oregon, meets the man of her dreams and is whisked off to Skagit River, Washington where she falls in love with Paul Tanner.
