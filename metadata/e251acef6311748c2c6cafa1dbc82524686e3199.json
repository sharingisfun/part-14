In Disappointment with God, he poses three questions that Christians wonder but seldom ask aloud: Is God unfair? Is he silent? Is he hidden? This insightful and deeply personal book points to the odd disparity between our concept of God and the realities of life. Why, if God is so hungry for relationship with us, does he seem so distant? Why, if God cares for us, do bad things happen? What can we expect from God after all? Yancey answers these questions with clarity, honesty, and biblical assurance. He points us beyond lifeâ€™s disappointments and the cynicism they can breed to a stronger, wiser faith, a confidence in Godâ€™s deep love for us, and a thirst to reach not just for what God gives, but for who God is.\r\n\r\n Please seed.
