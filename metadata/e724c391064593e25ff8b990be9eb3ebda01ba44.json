Achilles Last Stand is not present \r\non this concert and appears not to have been performed. Plant is in very \r\ngood voice at this show. His vocal adornments during Kashmir and Stairway \r\nTo Heaven resemble those from the 1977 tour. The firecracker incident \r\nduring White Summer cuts that song down to two and half minutes. Page \r\ndid take a wrong turn during White Summer and was attempting to find his \r\nway back when the firecracker struck. The announcer asks the audience to \r\nbring to the stage the perpetrator so they can have a word with him. After \r\nthe announcement, the band returns with a vengeance. Here is the whole \r\nannouncement translated from its original language: &quot;We have a group here \r\nthat is giving their best but they can't be disturbed by idiots who throw \r\nsomething onto the stage! Jimmy Page has been injured by a firecracker \r\nthat landed on his eyes! I can only ask for one thing: if someone is \r\nstanding next to you who does this kind of nonsense, give him a smart \r\nrap over the knuckles! I can't set up concerts in vienna - and i'm \r\nsetting up concerts since 15 years - if I can't guarantee for the safety \r\nof my acts (or performers). And now I must request your patience in order \r\nfor us to clear this situation. We can't just forget what just happened, \r\nthat's why we want the person who threw this to come up here on stage, \r\nor to be brought here by his neighbors. We want to meet him, we want to \r\ntalk to him. And if he himself doesn't have the guts to come up here - \r\nbecause we can't continue with the concert until we talked to him - his \r\nneighbors should get him on the stage. Then the concert will continue. \r\nWe'll have to talk to this man. I want him here because this idiot is \r\nmessing up the show for everyone.&quot; Page does lose his grip during Rock \r\nAnd Roll's guitar solo, but he delivers an inspired and lengthy solo \r\nduring Stairway To Heaven. After a light-hearted guitar introduction, \r\nthe band launches into the most inextricable version of Whole Lotta \r\nLove ever. Boogie Woogie holds the line","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e724c391064593e25ff8b990be9eb3ebda01ba44","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1980.06.26+Vienna%2C+Austria+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e724c391064593e25ff8b990be9eb3ebda01ba44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,36,195,145,6,69,147,226,95,248,185,144,190,158,179,235,218,1,186,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
