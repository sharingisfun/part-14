Dufour.\n\nThis is an unabridged recording, narrated by Tom West.  The Compact History of the Mexican War was released in 1968, and this audio book was produced in 1981 by Recorded Books, Inc.  It was released on audio cassette and has been out of print for a number of years.  Although there are many Short Histories on various other wars available, the Mexican War is one that is very hard to find, so I wanted to make this accessible today.  This audiobook contained eight 90 minute cassettes, with each side converted to a single mp3 file.  Running time: 11:20:54.
