One of the leading experts in the field and author of several books on the topic including the most recent Alien Interviews Marzulli looks at the current manifestations of UFO activity worldwide and relates these experiences to what ancient texts say about them, as well as current understanding. There is no doubt that UFOs are here and not going away. What does this mean? What are interdimensional beings? What are Orbs and why are all these things happening now? Has humanity finally become enlightened enough to accept new life forms? This documentary will bring LA Marzulli, a favorite on the wildly popular Coast to Coast AM, into a realistic discussion on UFOs, entities, and actual facts that are surrounding them.\n\nWatchers 2.\n\nWhy are the nations of the world in turmoil? What is happening with the sun and the moon? Why is it that birds are dropping out of the air dead, and why have fish numbering into the millions suddenly died without explanation? Why are there sinkholes of gigantic proportions appearing all over the earth, and what is happening with volcanic eruptions in Japan, Italy and Iceland? And what about the UFO seen over the Temple Mount? Something has changed, and Watchers 2 will try and investigate if what ancient texts have said for millenniums are true -- that we are entering a period where there will be wars, earthquakes, and famines -- including signs in the skies and the heavens. L.A. Marzulli will comment as well as interview experts on this volume. Including: Chuck Missler, Rabbi Aaron Parry, Stan Deyo, Jim Wilhelmsen, Helena Lehman. Dr. Roger Leir will also give us his update on alien implants.\n\n\nWatchers 3.\nL.A. Marzulli, author of the Cosmic Chess Match and popular guest on talk shows such as Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, hosts the third installment of the Watchers series. All over the world mysterious and unexplained events continue with little or no explanation from our governments or media. People are seeing multiple suns or hearing strange, anomalous sounds. NASAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SOHO images seem to be revealing unknown objects around the sun. Planet X/Nibiru Ã¢â‚¬â€œ could there be large unseen forces affecting our solar system? Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Shroud of Turin, which may be the most probed, enigmatic artifact on the planet. L.A. talks with two of the premier experts: recently knighted The Right Honorable Barrie Schwortz, whose photographs of the Shroud are iconic, and Dame Isabel Piczek, muralist and particle physicist. With the unprecedented Arab Spring, how does the unrest in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Jordan affect Israel? Is this uprising of millions of people being fanned by unseen supernatural forces? \n\n\nThe Watchers 4\nYet another amazing DVD from L.A. Marzulli's Watchers series. Watchers 4 is a must have for anyone interested in what is really going on around the world.\n\n\nThe Watchers 5\nPinlight began in the Fall of 2010 with &quot;The Watchers,&quot; the first DVD about UFOs.

The first is Genesis 6:1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4 NAS, immediately before the story of Noah's ark:\n\nNow it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. Then the LORD said, &quot;My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.&quot; The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b74702ebace23cfadb2f92a263914f812b65b05","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+03+-+The+Watcher+Angels+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b74702ebace23cfadb2f92a263914f812b65b05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,116,112,46,186,206,35,207,173,178,249,42,38,57,20,248,18,182,91,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
