It's available for the plugin formats VST and AudioUnit. It offers zero-latency processing with low CPU-consumption and non-destructive audio processing of impulse responses. SIR2 includes high definition impulse responses (HDIR) of *real* places produced by Pinguin, Hamburg. You can also use various impulse responses from free or commercial sources.\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nZero latency processing.\nLow CPU-spiking even with small sound-device buffers.\nIncludes Pinguin's High Definition Impulse Responses.\n&quot;True Stereo&quot; processing (a stereo convolution takes place for every source channel (left + right)).\nRouting capabilities ( mono-&gt;mono, mono-&gt;stereo, stereo-&gt;stereo...).\nHigh-quality internal sample rate converting.\nImports WAV, AIF, FLAC, BWS, OGG file formats.\nLinear phase FFT-EQ.\nFair Copy-Protection - NO challenge/response NO Dongle required - license key based.\nFree non-destructive amplitude envelope.\nFree non-destructive filter envelope.\nPre-delay (0ms - 2000ms).\nStretch control (high quality re-sampling).\nForward / reverse switch.\nStereo In / Stereo IR Control.\nPreset-managing.\nSeparate dry/wet control (-60db .. +20dB).\nAuto-gain (automatic volume compensation).\nSignal routing options.\nHDIR-Direct On/Off switch.\n&quot;Beat-Scale&quot;-mode.\nIf you have two stereo files, one with &quot;L&quot; and one with &quot;R&quot; at the end of the file name, you can click with right mouse button on one of the files to create a true stereo file. This is useful for third-party impulse response libraries.\nBuilt in impulse-file browser (with folders).\nPicture association.\nWaveform Zoom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7b518075857f91c18043820360d8a7dc4ce8b4d","amp;dn":"Knufinke+SIR2+v2.4.010+x86+x64+-+VR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7b518075857f91c18043820360d8a7dc4ce8b4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,181,24,7,88,87,249,28,24,4,56,32,54,13,138,125,196,206,139,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
