Brock and Fernette Eide describe an exciting new brain science that reveals that dyslexic people have unique brain structure and organization. While the differences are responsible for certain challenges with literacy and reading, the dyslexic brain also gives a predisposition to important skills, and special talents.\n\nWhile dyslexics typically struggle to decode the written word, they often also excel in such areas of reasoning as mechanical (required for architects and surgeons), interconnected (artists and inventors); narrative (novelists and lawyers), and dynamic (scientists and business pioneers). The Dyslexic Advantage provides the first complete portrait of dyslexia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd1603f4ea667a4eb3d6c718ab50225daaf9a428","amp;dn":"The+Dyslexic+Advantage+-+Unlocking+the+Hidden+Potential+of+the+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd1603f4ea667a4eb3d6c718ab50225daaf9a428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,22,3,244,234,102,122,78,179,214,199,24,171,80,34,93,170,249,164,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
