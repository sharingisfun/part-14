But this CD also proves that the British singer/songwriter is very much her own person. Naess' airy vocals might have a very Brickell-ish quality, but it's clear that a lot of other artists have had an impact on her introspective brand of alternative pop/rock. One can hear that Naess has been affected by fellow singer/songwriters -- Joni Mitchell, Tori Amos, and Beth Orton are among the names that come to mind -- and there are also hints of The Cure, David Bowie, Joy Division, and other British rockers in her work. Naess claims Tracy Chapman as a major influence, although Naess' voice doesn't sound anything like Chapman's. However, there are slight traces of Chapman in some of Naess' writing, but unlike Chapman, she doesn't bring a heavy sociopolitical agenda to the table. Rather, Naess chooses to make relationships and emotions her focus on this fairly promising, if imperfect, debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48206470f45eced4875db16d49b1410448828bab","amp;dn":"Leona+Naess+-+Comatised+%5B2000%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48206470f45eced4875db16d49b1410448828bab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,32,100,112,244,94,206,212,135,93,177,109,73,177,65,4,72,130,139,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
