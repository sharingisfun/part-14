Historically the interface between art and architecture was painting and color. Now in the age of cyberspace the new interface are the media, especially the interactive electronic media that allow the spectator to enter the image, to be in the image space. Thereby deconstructivist architecture represented by the famous group Coop Himmelblau takes a further step, also into research of new interface technologies. Examples of first rank media artists show how the imaginary virtual cyberspace and dataspace, the observer and the built real space can interact.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05545ebec7440735097975562dd5e702549a0951","amp;dn":"The+Media+Pavilion+-+Art+and+Architecture+in+the+Age+of+Cyberspa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05545ebec7440735097975562dd5e702549a0951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,84,94,190,199,68,7,53,9,121,117,86,45,213,231,2,84,154,9,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
