Their first album introduces several key themes for the group, including their eclecticism, gonzo sense of humor, and their demon god/mascot The Boognish.\n\nThis album would later be reissued in 2001 by Restless Records in a special \\&quot;25th Anniversary Edition\\&quot; (the album had been only 11 years old), featuring digitally remastered sound, new packaging, and the inclusion of three bonus tracks integrated into the original album\\&amp;#039;s playlist.\n\nThe album contains tracks that are still staples of Ween\\&amp;#039;s live performances, such as \\&quot;You Fucked Up,\\&quot; \\&quot;Fat Lenny,\\&quot; \\&quot;Marble Tulip Juicy Tree,\\&quot; and \\&quot;L.M.L.Y.P.\\&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:095d7ce27a48b384e4dfc672babde88b7f6858e3","amp;dn":"Ween+-+%5B1990%5D+God+Ween+Satan_+The+Oneness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"095d7ce27a48b384e4dfc672babde88b7f6858e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,93,124,226,122,72,179,132,228,223,198,114,186,189,232,139,127,104,88,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
