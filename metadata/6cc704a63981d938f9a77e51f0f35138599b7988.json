Downing and Glenn Tipton.\n \n\nJudas Priest are an English heavy metal band formed in Birmingham, England in 1969. Known for twin lead guitars, a wide operatic vocal style, and for introducing the S&amp;M leather-and-studs look into heavy metal, they have sold over 45 million albums worldwide. The band is widely recognised as one of the finest and most original heavy metal bands of all time, with many artists within the genre having cited them as a major influence. MTV ranked them the second &quot;Greatest Metal Band&quot; of all time.\n\nThey were a major influence on multiple sub-genres of heavy metal. Their influence, while mainly Rob Halford's operatic vocal style (widely considered as one of the most unique vocalists in the genre) and the twin guitar sound of K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, has been adopted by many bands. Their image of leather, spikes, and other taboo articles of clothing were widely influential during the glam metal era of the 1980s. Their 1980 album, British Steel, has been referred to as the &quot;record that, more than any other, codified what we mean by &quot;heavy metal&quot;.\n\nDespite a decline in exposure during the mid 1990s, the band has once again seen a resurgence, including worldwide tours, being inaugural inductees into the VH1 Rock Honors in 2005, receiving a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2010, and their songs featured in video games such as Guitar Hero and the Rock Band series.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;zdf.kultur&quot; logo at the top left)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Forever&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Forever&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/baAMLAAGD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/baAMLAAGD&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 9641kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:18\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
