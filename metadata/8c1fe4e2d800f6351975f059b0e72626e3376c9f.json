He has a dream: to take flight within the confines of the stadium. Brewster tells those he trusts of his dream, but displays a unique way of treating others who do not fit within his plans. When the fateful day arrives, and he enters the dome with his fanciful construction of bird wings, Brewster is surrounded by the police. Will he be caught before he attempts to fly?\n\n\nDiretor: Robert Altman\n\nCast: \n\nBud Cort\nSally Kellerman\nMichael Murphy\nWilliam Windom\nShelley Duvall\nRene Auberjonois\nStacy Keach\nJohn Schuck\nMargaret Hamilton\nJennifer Salt\nCorey Fischer\nG.
