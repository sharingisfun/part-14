Not even Star magazine could invent the true chaos that happens behind the scenes. Luckily, Tori is famously honest and self-deprecatingly funny when it comes to her perÃ‚Â­sonal life. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always Spelling It Like It Is. . . . \n\nLife is never boring at ToriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house, but since the release of her New York Times bestselling memoirs sTORI Telling, Mommywood, and UnÃ‚Â­charted terriTORI, things have been especially unpredictable: finding out she was pregnant with her third baby after nearly vomiting live on the Home Shopping Network; trying to hide her fourth pregnancy so soon after giving birth (as her stylist said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who would be that crazy?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½); beÃ‚Â­ing rescued from a paparazzo by a mom lynch mob; stalking her celebrity neighbor; and allowÃ‚Â­ing cameras to film every personal detail of her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€from the most challenging time in her marÃ‚Â­riage to the only time in six years when she really felt as though those cameras invaded her privacy. \n\nTori shares these stories and many more with the usual humor, candor, and down-to-earth charm that her fans love. She also writes openly about her biggest challenges: the terrifying health problems surrounding her high-risk pregnancy with her youngest son, Finn; her guilt over missing baby HattieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early months because she was in the hospital on bed rest; her struggles (and failures) to live within her means after growing up in opulence; the discovery that she has a lot in common with her late mega-producer father, Aaron Spelling; and how she fell in love with Dean all over again (hint: it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happen at their vow renewal ceremony). \n\nAfter years of revealing her everyday antics on-screen, ToriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is still full of surprises. Slowing down long enough to enjoy them? Now thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another sTORI.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57917acc37d8d826b47d9f5043af326bf897348a","amp;dn":"Tori+Spelling+-+Spelling+It+Like+It+Is+-+epub+%26amp%3B+mobi+torrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57917acc37d8d826b47d9f5043af326bf897348a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,145,122,204,55,216,216,38,180,125,159,80,67,175,50,107,248,151,52,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
