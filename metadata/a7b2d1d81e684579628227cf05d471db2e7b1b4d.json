He also visits the Atlas Mountains\nand provides an explanation of the how we see the orbit of Mars. This episode also provides an insight\non the rings of Saturn and the geysers of Enceladus, including images shown as seen from the CassiniÃ¢â‚¬â€œHuygens space probe.\n\n\n3. &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;\n.\nThe third episode looks at the atmosphere of the planets and moons of the Solar System, with Earth, Mars, and Titan being the main focus.\nThe episode starts with Cox taking a journey in an English Electric Lightning piloted by &quot;Mike Beachy Head&quot; up to an altitude\n&quot;between 55 and 60 thousand feet&quot; where the &quot;thinness and fragility&quot; of the atmosphere could be observed\nin the middle of the day transitioning &quot;from light blue to dark blue to black&quot;.\nLater, the Namib Desert is seen and used to give an explanation on how the Earth keeps its temperature, along with comparisons made to Mars.\nAn in-depth look at Titan is seen with footage shown from the Huygens probe descent down to the surface of the moon.\n\n\n4. &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;\n.\nThe fourth episode begins at the Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA, and immediate comparisons are drawn to Mars and the Valles Marineris.\nA trip to Kilauea on Hawaii shows the geological activity of Earth, and again a comparison to Mars and Olympus Mons is seen.\nAn analysis of Jupiter's gravitational effect is given with how it could potentially send an asteroid on a collision course with Earth.\nThe same gravitational force is also shown to give the Jovian moon Io geological life.\n\n\n5. &quot;Aliens&quot;\n.\nThe final installment covers life surviving in extreme environments, and how the search for life on other worlds follows the search for water,\nfocusing on Mars, and on Jupiter's moon Europa. Cox begins by travelling to the deep ocean to draw comparisons between space travel.\nThe Atacama Desert in South America is also viewed, which is seen to explain the lack of life found there.\nA trip to the Scablands in North-West America is also made with an explanation of the Missoula Floods that once occurred there, and how it shaped the landscape geologically.\nMore examinations of life come with a trip to Mexico and how life survives in caves.\n.\nHQ Subtitles: English, Dutch, Russian.
