Each member of the bloodline has a star shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dio Brando, the original nemesis of the Joestar family, and his descendants have this distinguishable mark also, a result from Dio's 'theft' of Jonathan Joestar's body and inheriting the Joestar genes as well. The series spans several generations, with each part featuring a descendent of the Joestars as the main protagonist along with a large cast of characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea9da5751e396fe147a574c98014c3e34d3b1fcb","amp;dn":"%5BZero-Raws%5D+JoJo+no+Kimyou+na+Bouken+-+11+%28MX+1280x720+x264+AAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea9da5751e396fe147a574c98014c3e34d3b1fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,157,165,117,30,57,111,225,71,165,116,201,128,20,195,227,77,59,31,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
