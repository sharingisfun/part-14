Your &quot;smart but scattered&quot; 4- to 13-year-old might also have trouble coping with disappointment or managing anger. Drs. Peg Dawson and Richard Guare have great news: there's a lot you can do to help. The latest research in child development shows that many kids who have the brain and heart to succeed lack or lag behind in crucial &quot;executive skills&quot;--the fundamental habits of mind required for getting organized, staying focused, and controlling impulses and emotions. Learn easy-to-follow steps to identify your child's strengths and weaknesses, use activities and techniques proven to boost specific skills, and problem-solve daily routines. Helpful worksheets and forms can be downloaded and printed in a convenient 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; size. Small changes can add up to big improvements--this empowering book shows how.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7154315c93dc7cbf12070ac8ef0ed85fe50ee3c3","amp;dn":"Smart+But+Scattered+-+Peg+Dawson+%26amp%3B+Richard+Guare+-+Chitrapat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7154315c93dc7cbf12070ac8ef0ed85fe50ee3c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,84,49,92,147,220,124,191,18,7,10,200,239,14,216,95,229,14,227,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
