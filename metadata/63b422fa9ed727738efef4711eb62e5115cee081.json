When the attack in the north by 6th Panzer Army failed, Hitler switched the focus of the offensive to General ManteuffelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 5th Panzer Army farther south. Overwhelming the green US 106th Division, German Panzers flooded towards the River Meuse. Barring their way was the crossroads town of Bastogne, reinforced at the last minute by the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Screaming EaglesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.
