The patriarch of the family, Michael, is rich, owns a compound, a nightclub, sings in a rock band and has political ambitions. His wife Adelaide goes out for a walk and a man attempts to rape her. She grievously injures him and then feeds. Suddenly she is ill, his blood is tainted. She is about to die and they must seek the help of occultists to guarantee she receives the proper vampire burial, an old and nearly forgotten ritual.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 29.970 fps, 1135 Kbps, 01h33m45s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, SOV, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/7pmnaauef/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/qg6pdyvmd/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4ia8k6glx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/p4yy5i00l/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/uf3wwsk9h/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0e774a0fc1494ea12ddb226ff294de3dfede98e","amp;dn":"Requiem+for+a+Vampire+%282006+-+USA%29+indie+horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0e774a0fc1494ea12ddb226ff294de3dfede98e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,231,116,160,252,20,148,234,18,221,178,38,255,41,77,227,223,237,233,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
