For the Hard Road 4:01 \n\nbrown bird's sound stems from the darker side of americana, laced with dream pop. this intimate, wintery, folk-tinged ensemble of guitar, cello, accordion, piano, and nearly whispered guy-girl vocals have elicited many a sigh of longing and sweetness from its audiences. the songs are tributes to nature, family strife, treachery, heartache, and inner struggle, that seem to have been born by firelight in the wee hours of the morn. \nbrown bird started with david lamb and his guitar, unemployed in seattle in the winter of 2002-2003. during this period, he added a multitude of new songs to his already impressive catalog. bringing with him the influences of hymns and sea shanties, and his history in noisy experimental rock bands, he produced an interesting blend of indie rock and americana. \nmoving back to maine for school, he met up with former band members jeremy and jerusha robinson, who had their own project called south china. the three began work on dave's new songs, and since the spring of 2004 they have put out two 4-song eps. \nthey are currently working on a full-length album which they expect to release in april of 2007. their songs continue to span the familiar, the introspective, and the slightly mysterious and intangible.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/23/brown-bird/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/23/brown-bird/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:900fa5a0d3fae1485e9c8ffff44fee004c0e298b","amp;dn":"Brown+Bird...Tautology%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"900fa5a0d3fae1485e9c8ffff44fee004c0e298b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,15,165,160,211,250,225,72,94,156,143,255,244,79,238,0,76,14,41,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
