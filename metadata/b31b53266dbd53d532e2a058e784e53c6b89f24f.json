(USA - 1970)\n\n\nDrama / Action\n\ndirector . . . Ralph Nelson\nstarring . . . Jim Brown, George Kennedy, Fredric March\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065360/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065360/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAn American crime drama movie made in 1970 directed by Ralph Nelson. Racially provocative for its time, it stars Jim Brown in the role of an African-American man elected as the sheriff of a rural county in the American South. It has become something of a cult classic for its cutting-edge portrayal of racial relations and its tense narrative.\n\nIn a small Mississippi town, deputy Jim Price is elected sheriff over John Little, the incumbent. Racial tensions exist in the community and Price gets little assistance from Little, leaving office, or from Mayor Parks, who insists he be consulted on any decision the new sheriff makes.\n\nThe movie can be viewed as something of a counter-narrative to In the Heat of the Night, which featured Sidney Poitier as a Philadelphia detective sent to help investigate a murder in a small town in Mississippi and aided, at first reluctantly, by the white chief of police played by Rod Steiger.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 720x304, 23.976 fps, 1964 kbps, 01h36m47s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\n\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/66mywl94r/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/66mywl94r/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jjnq32inx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jjnq32inx/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/h3lwp80l9/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/h3lwp80l9/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/qdy0srbb1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/qdy0srbb1/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/lqryqzny5/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/lqryqzny5/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwith thanks to RL for this, June 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b31b53266dbd53d532e2a058e784e53c6b89f24f","amp;dn":"tick...+tick...+tick...+%5B1970%5D+%28Jim+Brown%2C+George+Kennedy%29+crime","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b31b53266dbd53d532e2a058e784e53c6b89f24f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,27,83,38,109,189,83,213,50,226,160,88,231,132,229,60,107,137,242,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
