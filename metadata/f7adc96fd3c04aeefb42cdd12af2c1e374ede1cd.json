Hack/Slash started in 2004 as a series of one-shots, starting with the Stefano Caselli-penciled Hack/Slash (later referred to by its story title Euthanized), followed by the Federica Manfredi-penciled Girls Gone Dead.\n\n2005 saw the one-shots Comic Book Carnage and the series stars, Vlad and Cassie, appeared in the Aadi Salman penciled The Final Revenge of Evil Ernie. The &quot;Hack/Slash&quot; one shots were collected as the First Cut trade paperback in the same year. The first &quot;Hack/Slash&quot; miniseries debuted, Land of Lost Toys, penciled by Dave Crosland, followed by a collection of new short stories in a 2006 special issue called Trailers (featuring art by writer stefano caselli and Tim Seeley, original penciler Caselli, Mike Norton, Skottie Young and Josh Medors).\n\nA 25-cent preview issue giving newcomers a recap of &quot;Euthanized&quot; hit the markets in 2006, along with &quot;Slice Hard&quot;, the first one-shot of 2006. Seeley penciled the new part of the preview and was one of the pencilers and inkers of the one-shot along with Mark Englert, Nate Bellgarde, Andy Kuhn and Joe Largent. The one-shot Hack/Slash Vs. Chucky, had the lead duo taking on the evil doll and was penciled by Matt Merhoff.\n\n2007 had a Free Comic Day tie-in with Devil's Due's &quot;Family Guy&quot;, where both books had half the issue to itself. The &quot;Hack/Slash&quot; section had a recap portion of the 25 cent preview issue. &quot;Hack/Slash&quot; graduated to an ongoing series in May 2007.\n\nThe ongoing series has included a crossover with Re-Animator (from Herbert WestÃ¢â‚¬â€œReanimator), where Herbert West is tied in to her father, as well a Hack/Slash Annual collecting the web comic featuring the SuicideGirls photo shoot.\n\nCreator Tim Seely moved Hack/Slash from Devil's Due Publishing to Image Comics in June 2010.\n\nReading/Publication Order:\nHack/Slash: Euthanized (April 2004)\nHack/Slash: Girls Gone Dead (October 2004)\nHack/Slash: Comic Book Carnage!
