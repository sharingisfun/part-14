This book first introduces the fundamental building blocks that form a modern network, such as protocols, topologies, hardware, and network operating systems. It then provides in-depth coverage of the most important concepts in contemporary networking, such as TCP/IP, Ethernet, wireless transmission, and security. After reading the book and completing the end-of-chapter exercises, you will be prepared to select the best network design, hardware, and software for your environment. \n\nYou will also have the skills to build a network from scratch and maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot an existing network. Finally, you will be well prepared to pass CompTIA's (the Computing Technology Industry Association's) Network+ certification exam. This book explains concepts logically and in a clear, approachable style. In addition, concepts are reinforced by real-world examples of networking issues from a professional's standpoint. \n\nEach chapter opens with an On the Job story from a network engineer. These real-world examples, along with Hands-on Projects and Case Projects in each chapter, make this book a practical learning tool. The numerous tables and illustrations, along with the glossaries, appendices, and study questions make the book a valuable reference for any networking professional.\n\nTitle: Network + Guide to Networks\nPublisher: Course Technology\nAuthor: Tamara Dean\nYear: 2009\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
