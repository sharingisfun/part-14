Muirwood Abbey is one of the few places where learners are taught to read and engrave, and thirteen year-old Lia wants nothing more than to learn both of these skills - yet she is a wretched, an orphan, and doomed to remain in the Aldermaston's kitchen, forbidden to read and subject to his authority. Her future is destined for preparing recipes in a privileged household until, unexpectedly, a mysterious knight-maston abandons the wounded squire Colvin at the Aldermaston's kitchen in the middle of the night. Soon after, Sheriff Almaguer comes hunting for Colvin, and Lia is thrust into the greatest adventure of her life as she and the squire are forced into a partnership that brings her closer to her dream - and Colvin closer to his fear of dying on the battlefield. \n- Goodreads Summary of The Wretched of Muirwood (Muirwood #1)\n\nNote: A great fantasy series with critical reception, targeted towards a young adult audience, but is recommendable to everybody.\n\nCompatibility: Most eReaders\n\nCovers: Yes\n\nMetadata: Yes\n\nAny requests?
