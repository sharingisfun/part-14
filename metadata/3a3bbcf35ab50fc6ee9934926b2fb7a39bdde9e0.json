It is a remake of the series that stays more true to the original manga- it is a lot more fast paced, and more interesting.\n\nI have been having a lot of trouble finding all of these episodes dubbed so I figured I would upload all of the ones I've gotten already. I made it a .7z so that people couldnt just snag an episode or two and leave- I hope it's not too much of an inconvenience.\n\nIf you don't know how to unpack a .7z just download 7zip from 7zip.org\n\nHope you all have a great one :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a3bbcf35ab50fc6ee9934926b2fb7a39bdde9e0","amp;dn":"Full+Metal+Alchemist+Brotherhood+%28Eng+Dub%29+Ep.+1-39","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a3bbcf35ab50fc6ee9934926b2fb7a39bdde9e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,59,188,243,90,181,15,198,238,153,52,146,107,47,183,163,155,221,233,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
