Series two covers the second and third civil wars and the eventual Restoration of the Monarchy. The last episodes sees the surviving members of the family (from both sides of the divide) witness the arrival of Charles II on a visit to the ancestral Lacey home.\n\nThanks to pmb001 at thebox.bz\t\n\n(Fixed torrentname)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd9cd0c9679ad2bc58c0bd0f4fe4a3e9486eb4a1","amp;dn":"By+The+Sword+Divided","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd9cd0c9679ad2bc58c0bd0f4fe4a3e9486eb4a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,156,208,201,103,154,210,188,88,192,189,15,79,228,163,233,72,110,180,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
