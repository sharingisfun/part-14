His passion for politics, humanity and the environment has been the driving force behind his songs, which have won him both fans and enemies since he began performing in the 1930s. His simple honesty and pure-hearted clarity has helped change the course of history during his 60-plus years career. Fatured here are some of his very best recordings from the '50s.
