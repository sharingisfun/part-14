His four year killing\nspree terrorized co-ed dorms across America and led the police\non a cross country manhunt that would later lead to Bundy\nescaping twice from police custody to continue his murderous habits.\n\nWhile using different identities and disguises to elude capture\nBundy finds his way to Florida to commit what becomes his last\nmurders before being caught and tried in a court of law.\n\nUsing his law school savvy to defend himself in his own murder case,\nTed Bundy clearly proved himself to be one of the smartest and\nmost notorious serial killers in the history of America before\nbeing convicted and sent to the electric chair in 1989.\n\nThis film details the dark psyche and previously unexplored\nmotivations of the man who became known as one of the most\nnotorious serial killers to leave behind a legacy of evil.\n\nCAST\n\nCorin Nemec ...
