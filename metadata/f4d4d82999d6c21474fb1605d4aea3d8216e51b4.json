P. Demidovich. \n\nThe list of authors is G. Baranenkov B. Demidovich, V. Efimenko, S. Kogan, G. Lunts, E. Porshneva,E. Sychera, S. Frolov, R. Shostak and A.  Yanpolsky. \n\n  This collection of problems and exercises in mathematical analysis\n  covers the maximum requirements of general courses in higher\n  mathematics for higher technical schools. It contains over 3,000\n  problems sequentially arranged in Chapters I to X covering branches\n  of higher mathematics (with the exception of analytical geometry)\n  given in college courses. Particular attention is given to the most\n  important sections of the course that require established skills\n  (the finding of limits, differentiation techniques, the graphing of\n  functions, integration techniques, the applications all of definite\n  integrals, series, the solution of differential equations).  \n\n  This collection of problems is the result of many years of teaching\n  higher mathematics in the technical schools of the Soviet Union. It\n  includes, in addition to original problems and examples, a large\n  number of commonly used problems. \n\n\n  This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky. The\n  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 19??.\n  \n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  PDF | OCR | 15.2 MB | Pages: 511 |  \n  \n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface 9\n\nChapter I \nINTRODUCTION TO ANALYSIS 11\n\nChapter II\nDIFFERENTIATION OF FUNCTIONS\n\nChapter III\nTHE EXTREMA OF A FUNCTION AND THE GEOMETRIC\nAPPLICATIONS OF A DERIVATIVE\n\nChapter IV\nINDEFINITE INTEGRALS\n\nChapter V\nDEFINITE INTEGRALS\n\nChapter VI.\nFUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES\n\nChapter VII.\nMULTIPLE AND LINE INTEGRALS\n\nChapter VIII. \nSERIES\n\nChapter IX \nDIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\n\nChapter X.\nAPPROXIMATE CALCULATIONS\n\nANSWERS 396\nAPPENDIX 475\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4d4d82999d6c21474fb1605d4aea3d8216e51b4","amp;dn":"Problems+in+Mathematical+Analysis+-+Demidovich+%28Ed.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4d4d82999d6c21474fb1605d4aea3d8216e51b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,212,216,41,153,214,194,20,116,251,22,5,212,174,163,216,33,110,81,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
