Key events include his early television work with the Muppets while still a student at the University of Maryland, his commercial work and network appearances in the late 1950s and early 1960's, his breakthrough with Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, and his groundbreaking fantasy films, Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.\r\nAmong those interviewed for the Jim Henson episode are his children, Lisa, Cheryl, Brian and Heather Henson, actors Neil Patrick Harris and Candice Bergen, Willard Scott, director John Landis, former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, and Sesame Street cast members Bob McGrath and Carroll Spinney.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen0.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d5/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen1.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/14/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen2.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bd/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen3.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen4.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen5.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen6.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen7.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen8.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen9.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e0/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen10.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/In-Their-Own-Words-Jim-Henson-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 1910 Kbps (CRF 21)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Framerate: 29.970 fps\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC (Nero)\r\n * Audio Quality: 0.48 48KHz (~132 Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 54mn 58s\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 805 MiB\r\n * Container: MP4\r\n * Released: 2015\r\n * Source: HDTV AVC 1080i\r\n * Encoder: KarMa\r\n * Subtitles: English - Merged in the MP4\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.pbs.org/program/in-their-own-words/\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Being%20Elmo%3A%20A%20Puppeteer%27s%20Journey\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Whatever%20Happened%20to%20Spitting%20Image\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Make%20Me%20Happy%3A%20A%20Monkey%27s%20Search%20for%20Happiness\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Walt%20Disney\r\n\r\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=In_Their_Own_Words:_Jim_Henson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f70d526d43663c8def441321090276c6c7b9df1","amp;dn":"PBS.In.Their.Own.Words.Jim.Henson.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f70d526d43663c8def441321090276c6c7b9df1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,112,213,38,212,54,99,200,222,244,65,50,16,144,39,108,108,123,157,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
