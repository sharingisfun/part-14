Whether it's young Muslims threatened with exorcism, or West African Christian parents ostracising their own gay kids, religion plays a part in the story. But Reggie also wants to find out why so few gay men of colour are visible at events like Gay Pride, given the special cultural problems they already face.\r\n\r\n2)  Men at War \r\nIn the second film, Reggie meets the angry young British men who think feminism has gone too far- and some of the women who have felt their wrath, on an internet tailor-made for anti-feminism, and trolls. From young guys espousing men's rights at Speakers Corner in Hyde Park, to the underground movement of male separatists of MGTOW (or Men Going Their Own Way), Reggie also encounters infamous self-styled pick-up artist Roosh V, who dishes out advice on how to have more sex with women - but doesn't seem to like them very much.\r\n\r\n3)  Dying for a Six Pack \r\nReggie investigates the extreme ways in which male body culture is impacting on young British guys - from extreme exercise to invasive plastic surgery and even steroid abuse. As Reggie embarks on his own challenge to get into shape he asks what it's all for and follows the story from a private hospital in Istanbul to a lock-up in the Midlands and beyond.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a2/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e0/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/65/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Reggie-Yates-Extreme-UK-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2980 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 58mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.24 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06ryrz2\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Reggie%20Yates%27%20Extreme%20Russia \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Reggie%20Yates%20Extreme%3A%20South%20Africa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f6010b8a6b8f064f45591795c3ab3063786ac2","amp;dn":"BBC+Reggie+Yates+Extreme+UK+Series+1+2of3+Men+At+War+720p+x264+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f6010b8a6b8f064f45591795c3ab3063786ac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,246,1,11,138,107,143,6,79,69,89,23,149,195,171,48,99,120,106,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
