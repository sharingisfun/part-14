He is a citizen of the United States where he has lived since he was fifteen years old. His 2003 debut novel, The Kite Runner, was an international bestseller, with the paperback spending 101 weeks on the bestseller list (#1 for 4 of those weeks). In 2007, it was followed by A Thousand Splendid Suns which has spent 21 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list for paperback fiction and 49 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction (#1 for 15 of those weeks). The two novels have sold more than 38 million copies internationally.\n\n\nDan Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author of thriller fiction, best known for the 2003 bestselling novel, The Da Vinci Code. Brown's novels are treasure hunts set in a 24-hour period, and feature the recurring themes of cryptography, keys, symbols, codes, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 52 languages, and as of 2012, sold over 200 million copies. Two of them, The Da Vinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons, have been adapted into films.\n\nBrown's novels that feature the lead character Robert Langdon also include historical themes and Christianity as motifs, and as a result, have generated controversy. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian, though he is on a 'constant spiritual journey' himself, and says that his book The Da Vinci Code is simply &quot;an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate&quot; and suggests that the book may be used &quot;as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f8863d764d79100192b052e395908bace36bb3","amp;dn":"A+Collection+of+Popular+Novels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83f8863d764d79100192b052e395908bace36bb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,248,134,61,118,77,121,16,1,146,176,82,227,149,144,139,172,227,107,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
