They were queried about the exact time this star appeared. Can we actually unlock the mystery of the world's most famous star? If this was an actual event - can there possibly be historical and scientific evidence for the Star of Bethlehem, the star followed by Magi from the east? These questions have perplexed mankind for over two thousand years. Now, from producer Stephen McEveety (The Passion of the Christ) comes an amazing documentary on the mystical Star of Bethlehem. This presentation explores the exciting story in scripture and examines evidence for God's existence as seen in the heavens. Commentator Rick Larson walks you through Biblical, historical, and scientific clues revealing the incredible significance of this celestial event and the vastness of God's creativity. The old carol spoke about it: &quot;O, star of wonder, star of might, star with royal beauty bright, westward leading, still proceeding, guide us to thy perfect light.&quot; If there was a real star over the skies of Judea when Jesus of Nazareth was born, perhaps there are scientific answers to prove it. We should now be able to use our advanced computer technology to go back in time and see what happened - and discern exactly where certain stars were in the sky. Could this Star have actually existed and pointed to the birth of the Savior? Sit back, watch the heavens and see what was going on when Jesus was born...\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal.
