Edward Griffin. Recipient of the Telly Award for excellence in television \nproduction.\n\nDVDRip\n\nDescription:\n\nThis is not the sensationalized program aired on CBS in 1993 which depicted \nNoah's Ark protruding from the ice on Mt. Ararat. That program was later shown \nto have been based on falsified stories, myth, and bogus documents. This is \nthe real Ark site!\n\nNoah's Ark has been found. Here is the evidence, including photographs, to \nprove it. Furthermore, you can visit the site yourself, and you won't have to \nclimb into a glacier to get there!\n\nHere are the facts. It is in Turkey 17 miles from Mt. Ararat on a gentle slope \nat the 6000-foot elevation. It is a man-made object and was clearly designed \nas a boat. It incorporates principles of higher mathematics and advanced \nhydrodynamics. It contains decks and interior chambers. It is the proper \ndimension for the Ark. It is in the proper geographical location. It is \naccompanied by large, anchor stones of an appropriate size. It has been \nvisited by religious pilgrims for thousands of years. It is consistent with \nthe Bible, the Torah, and the ancient clay tablets from Sumer. And it is \nsurrounded by mountains and villages which carry names from antiquity relating \nto the Ark's landing.\n\nThis program was written and narrated by G. Edward Griffin. It is based upon \nthe book, The Ark of Noah, by David Fasold and includes testimony by Mr. \nFasold, author Donald Patten, marine engineer Sam Windsor, and archaeologist \nMarvin Luckerman.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1de3cb2df92dba656c834195f716ea194cc253aa","amp;dn":"The+Discovery+of+Noah%5C%27s+Ark+%28G.+Edward+Griffin%29+1993+%28DVDRip%3B+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1de3cb2df92dba656c834195f716ea194cc253aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,227,203,45,249,45,186,101,108,131,65,149,247,22,234,25,76,194,83,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
