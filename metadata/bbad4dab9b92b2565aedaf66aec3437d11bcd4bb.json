Marcus Roma showed me how.\n\nSix years ago, my parents died in a car accident. Marcus Roma picked me up off the ground and held me until I could stand on my own two feet.\n\nFive years ago, I fell in love with him.\n\nAnd then Marcus Roma disappeared. No warning. No explanation. Just gone.\n\nYesterday, he came back.\n\nAnd now I have to decide whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s telling the truth, and whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lying. Who wants something from me, and who wantsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nMe.\n\nIf I guess wrong, I could lose everything. I need to think clearly. But Marcus makes that impossible. Marcus makes me weak. Marcus makes me want, in a way IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never felt before.\n\nMarcus Roma will make me fall. The only question isÃ¢â‚¬â€will he be there to catch me this time?\nGenre: Fiction, Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbad4dab9b92b2565aedaf66aec3437d11bcd4bb","amp;dn":"Lie+To+Me+%28Redemption%29+-+Cox%2C+Chloe.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbad4dab9b92b2565aedaf66aec3437d11bcd4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,173,77,171,155,146,178,86,90,237,175,102,174,195,67,125,17,188,212,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
