The domino-style structure in which the financial system exists is a perilous one. Although historically, the financial system has been able to deal with major shocks, the fact remains that our financial system is not as secure as it should be.\nRecent years have brought about too many examples of contagion and systemic risk. That is why Financial Contagion is such an important read. In it, the serious concerns that revolve around our fragile economic system are investigated, researched, and explained.\nThroughout the book, Kolb offers valuable insights on this dilemma as he compiles the history of financial contagion, highlights the latest research on systemic failure and interrelated markets, and analyzes the risks and consequences we face moving forward.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162273f2da8ec4d2e3891395078228ea67705ade","amp;dn":"Financial+Contagion%3A+The+Viral+Threat+to+the+Wealth+of+Nations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162273f2da8ec4d2e3891395078228ea67705ade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,34,115,242,218,142,196,210,227,137,19,149,7,130,40,234,103,112,90,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
