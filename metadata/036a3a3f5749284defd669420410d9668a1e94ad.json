Equal parts brilliant and charming, neurotic and manipulative, Harry has devoted his life to exposing the truth behind England's many 'false hauntings', and never has he left a case unsolved, nor a fraud unexposed.\n\nSo when Harry and Sarah are invited to Borley Rectory - a house so haunted objects frequently fly through the air unbidden, and locals avoid the grounds for fear of facing the spectral nun that walks there - they're sure that this case will be just like any other. But when night falls and still no artifice can be found, the ghost hunters are forced to confront an uncomfortable truth: the ghost of Borley Rectory may be real and, if so, they're about to make its most intimate acquaintance.\n\nGenre: Mystery/Horror","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:036a3a3f5749284defd669420410d9668a1e94ad","amp;dn":"The+Ghost+Hunters+by+Neil+Spring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"036a3a3f5749284defd669420410d9668a1e94ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,106,58,63,87,73,40,77,239,214,105,66,4,16,217,102,138,30,148,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
