Told in a sentimental tone, Burns weaves a lyrical tale of the great metropolis that encompasses not only the city&amp;#039;s streets, but also that of the history of America. Though around fourteen hours in length, this epic documentary presents a thoughtful, entertaining look at our relatively young country.\n\nPlease, share and if you can upload it to file storing servers!!!!\n\n\nxxxyyyzzz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:026675b28f052b608c93898102eb0272825ae459","amp;dn":"New+York%2C+A+Documentary+Film+-+06+-+City+of+Tomorrow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"026675b28f052b608c93898102eb0272825ae459","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,102,117,178,143,5,43,96,140,147,137,129,2,235,2,114,130,90,228,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
