The scope of coverage is all areas of chemical science including the interfaces with related disciplines such as biology, medicine and materials science.\nThe goal of each thematic volume is to give the non-specialist reader, whether in academia or industry, a comprehensive insight into an area where new research is emerging which is of interest to a larger scientific audience.\nEach review within the volume critically surveys one aspect of that topic and places it within the context of the volume as a whole. The most significant developments of the last 5 to 10 years are presented using selected examples to illustrate the principles discussed. The coverage is not intended to be an exhaustive summary of the field or include large quantities of data, but should rather be conceptual, concentrating on the methodological thinking that will allow the non-specialist reader to understand the information presented. Contributions also offer an outlook on potential future developments in the field.\nReview articles for the individual volumes are invited by the volume editors.\nReadership: research chemists at universities or in industry, graduate students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac463630cc75b6afb2ab78f47c4be4a3e4ed6e1","amp;dn":"Homogeneous+Gold+Catalysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac463630cc75b6afb2ab78f47c4be4a3e4ed6e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,196,99,99,12,199,91,106,251,42,183,143,71,196,190,74,62,78,214,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
