Better yet, what about activities you need to do? \r\n\r\n\r\nImplementing these new behaviors requires change, and letâ€™s face it, change is hard! Itâ€™s a lot easier to quit or, at best, give a half-hearted effort. The problem with taking the easy route is that you donâ€™t feel youâ€™ve accomplished anything, and you rarely see lasting results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this practical, actionable book, Scotty Studer shows you how to implement the important-but-not-urgent activities in your life by making small changes. These changes will not require a drastic alteration in your â€œroutineâ€ or require a lot of time to do, but they will provide consistent results!\r\n\r\n\r\nBy using personal life stories and examples from others, he gives you specific changes to implement that are effective, and easy to do! \r\n\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to have:\r\n\r\n- An actionable plan to create financial stability\r\n\r\n- A closer, personal relationship with God\r\n\r\n- Friends complimenting you on how thin and fit you look\r\n\r\n- Relationships with your kids growing deeper and more meaningful than ever before\r\n\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t take the easy, half-hearted route to implement proactive change. Instead, learn how to achieve lasting results by taking small, intentional actions every day in four important areas of your life: faith, relationships, health and finances!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a68da3efe2e5506106ab18e733873981b27045","amp;dn":"Small+Changes%2C+Big+Results%3A+26+simple+changes+to+improve+your+fa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a68da3efe2e5506106ab18e733873981b27045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,166,141,163,239,226,229,80,97,6,171,24,231,51,135,57,129,178,112,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
