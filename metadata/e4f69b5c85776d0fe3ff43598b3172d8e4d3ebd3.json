Construction materials, system deployment, typical installations, and environmental impact are covered.\n\nAlternative Energy Systems in Building Design includes information on LEED design, energy conservation, and solar power financing and return on investment. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) and national and international carbon cap and trade are also discussed. Valuable appendices contain detailed design data tables and certified equipment listings.\n\nAlternative Energy Systems in Building Design covers:\n\n# Solar power system physics and technologies\n# California solar initiative program\n# Energy conservation\n# Passive heating solar technologies\n# Fuel cell technology\n# Wind energy technologies\n# Ocean energy technologies\n# Hydroelectric and micro-hydro turbine power\n# Geothermal energy\n# Biofuel, biogas, and thermal depolymerization technologies\n# Fission- and fusion-type nuclear power\n# Air pollution abatement ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f69b5c85776d0fe3ff43598b3172d8e4d3ebd3","amp;dn":"Alternative+Energy+Systems+in+Building+Design+2009+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f69b5c85776d0fe3ff43598b3172d8e4d3ebd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,246,155,92,133,119,109,15,227,255,67,89,139,49,114,216,228,211,235,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
