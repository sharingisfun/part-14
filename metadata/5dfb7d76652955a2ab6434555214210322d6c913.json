Blix label. \n\nSongbird cherry-picks tracks from the three locally released albums of \nEva Cassidy, whose hauntingly beautiful vocals went virtually unheard outside \nher native Washington, D.C., during her short 33 years with us. \n\nLost to melanoma in 1996, Cassidy sang with an unaffected purity and an \nastonishing ability to make both classic and contemporary songs sound like they \nwere written just for her. Sting's &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; finally lives up to its title \nthrough the alchemy of Cassidy's transcendent rendition, while other tracks on \nthis anthology showcase her ease in the realms of pop (Christine McVie's &quot;Songbird&quot;), \nsoul (&quot;People Get Ready&quot;), gospel (&quot;Wade on the Water&quot;), and traditional standards \n(&quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;). Framed by understated jazz and pop \narrangements, Cassidy's clear, soulful voice and exquisite phrasing make her that \nrarest of vocalists whose interpretations are a complement to any song. A fine \nintroduction to a true talent.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n    \n[01] Fields Of Gold\n[02] Wade In The Water\n[03] Autumn Leaves\n[04] Wayfaring Stranger\n[05] Songbird\n[06] Time Is A Healer\n[07] I Know You By Heart\n[08] People Get Ready\n[09] Oh, I Had A Golden Thread\n[10] Over The Rainbow  \n\n\n\nTotal Play Time \t- 00h:42m:59s\n\nTotal File Size \t- 109 mb (Including Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t- 320 kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t- MP3 Format\n\nMusic Genre\t- Folk / Pop / Sou / Gospel\n\nRelease Date\t- 19 May 1998\n\nRecord Company \t- Dara Records Blix Street Records\n\nArtists WebSite \t- http://www.evacassidy.org/eva/eva.shtml\t\n\t\t- &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.evacassidy.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.evacassidy.com&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n* * * PLEASE SEED TO A RATIO OF 1:1 OR GREATER * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LL ONLY RE-SEED IF THERE IS MORE THAN 10 PEERS WAITING * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dfb7d76652955a2ab6434555214210322d6c913","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+Songbird+-+Eva+Cassidy+-+%40+320+%23%23%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dfb7d76652955a2ab6434555214210322d6c913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,251,125,118,101,41,85,162,171,100,52,85,82,20,33,3,34,214,201,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
