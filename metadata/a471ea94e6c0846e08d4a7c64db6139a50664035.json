Published for the first time in book form, Wake Up is KerouacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s retelling of the story of Prince Siddhartha Gautama, who as a young man abandoned his wealthy family and comfortable home for a lifelong search for Enlightenment. As a compendium of the teachings of the Buddha, Wake Up is a profound meditation on the nature of life, desire, wisdom, and suffering. Distilled from a wide variety of canonical scriptures, Wake Up serves as both a concise primer on the concepts of Buddhism and as an insightful and deeply personal document of KerouacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s evolving beliefs. It is the work of a devoted spiritual follower of the Buddha who also happened to be one of the twentieth centuryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most influential novelists. Wake Up: A Life of the Buddha will be essential reading for the legions of Jack Kerouac fans and for anyone who is curious about the spiritual principles of one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great religions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a471ea94e6c0846e08d4a7c64db6139a50664035","amp;dn":"Wake+Up+-+A+Life+of+the+Buddha+-+Jack+Kerouac.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a471ea94e6c0846e08d4a7c64db6139a50664035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,113,234,148,230,192,132,110,8,212,167,198,77,182,19,154,80,102,64,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
