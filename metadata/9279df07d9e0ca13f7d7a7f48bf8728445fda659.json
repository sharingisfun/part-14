It consists of Serj Tankian (lead vocals, keyboards, rhythm guitar), Daron Malakian (vocals, guitar), Shavo Odadjian (bass, background vocals) and John Dolmayan  (drums). All four members are of Armenian descent, and are widely known for their outspoken views expressed in many of their songs confronting the Armenian Genocide of 1915 by the Ottoman Empire as well as the ongoing War on Terror.\n\nThe band has achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums. System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, and won the award in 2006 for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot;. On August 13, 2006, the group went on indefinite hiatus. Three of their studio albums debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200.\n\n[align=center][IMG]http://a.imageshack.us/img820/5349/antl.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9279df07d9e0ca13f7d7a7f48bf8728445fda659","amp;dn":"System+of+a+Down+-+Discography+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+Nu+Metal+%5BTNT+Vill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9279df07d9e0ca13f7d7a7f48bf8728445fda659","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,121,223,7,217,224,202,19,247,215,167,244,139,248,114,132,69,253,166,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
