He released his debut album, Martes, under the name Murcof in Mexico in 2001 before it saw American distribution through the Leaf Label in 2002. Vastly departing from his work with Mexico?s Nortec Collective as Terrestre, Corona managed to create a sound that not so much exploits as embraces the classical/romanticism of Rachel?s and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. But where these bands use the classics to evoke an epic or cinematic grandiosity, Corona avoids those stereotypes in his pieces.\n\nThis collection of singles and remixes titled Utopia continues his project in perfect fashion.\n\nDeep bass and cello lines bow back and forth in Doppler effects, the rhythmic echo of the violin interlocking with the atmospheric textures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf2787c0cb96040d9353666dda8d5a04c1bd132","amp;dn":"Murcof+-+Utopia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf2787c0cb96040d9353666dda8d5a04c1bd132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,242,120,124,12,185,96,64,217,53,54,102,221,168,213,160,76,27,209,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
