Along with his leopard -skin clad sidekick Janu, Congo Bill protected Africa's people and wildlife from exploitation. Later, Bill would become the super hero Congorilla by transferring his consciousness to the body of an ape called the Golden Gorilla. Although Congo Bill only lasted 7 issues, it set the stage for Congorilla and Golden Gorilla story lines that would unfold across different titles over the next few decades.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d809178e125707f353be4a61356cd57be5e1c8ce","amp;dn":"Congo+Bill+%28v1+-+v2%29+%281954+%26amp%3B+1999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d809178e125707f353be4a61356cd57be5e1c8ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,9,23,142,18,87,7,243,83,190,74,97,53,108,213,123,229,225,200,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
