Bootlegged for years following the performance, the new issues present the performance for the first time mastered and color corrected. The performance of the band's 1992 hit single &quot;Lithium&quot; was previously released on the home video Live! Tonight! Sold Out!! in 1994. The performance of &quot;Tourette's&quot; was previously released on the live compilation From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah in 1996. Live at Reading marks the first time on a Nirvana release that Chet Powers receives songwriting credit for the use of his lyrics from the song &quot;Get Together&quot; as the intro for &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;. It features Cobain wheeled out on stage by music journalist Everett True.\n\n.: Cover :.\n\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01. Breed\n02. Drain You\n03. Aneurysm\n04. School\n05. Sliver\n06. In Bloom\n07.
