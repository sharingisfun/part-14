This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey tells how one night, Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen were cruising around LA playing demos from their upcoming albums using the car's tape deck. They decided to stop in a parking lot at which point the music must have been too loud for one freshly awakened neighbor, who ran them off never knowing who they were. Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band have the 36th most popular song in the nation this week with &quot;Roll Me Away.&quot;\n\nCasey says this is the third week in a row to have a record-setting 24 foreign acts in the countdown.\n\nOne recording artist in the countdown is one of only three acts ever to have hit number one with a song written or co-written by a Beatle (not including the Beatles themselves). Casey tells who.\n\nAnother artist in this countdown got a surprise when security decided to let one of her fans backstage. He showed them his fifth-grade class photo, from when this lead-singer was his grade school teacher.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;Who is the oldest person ever to hit the top 40?&quot; Casey says the man whose spoken-word record set the record in '74 was 73 when it did, and he was still living at the time of this broadcast!\n\nCasey says in the history of the Billboard chart, only five albums have ever been able to produce 4 top 10 hits, and only one artist can say two of those albums belong to him. The song that gave him those bragging rights is in this countdown. Casey tells which one.\n\n***** CAST YOUR VOTE! *****\n\nThere are two radio stations I always try to record for each week's '80s broadcast, but I can't decide if one or the other has better quality audio. So in my never ending quest for great customer service (and because I have some decision-making phobia), I've included a second copy of segment 13 this week. Vote for the station you think sounds better, and I will use the winning station for each week's show as long as nothing prevents me from getting it.\n\nTo vote for the (13)_July_16th,_1983 (which is part of the entire show), leave a comment that says, &quot;I vote for station #1.&quot;\n\nTo vote for the (13)_July_16th,_1983 (which is in the Station_2_Sample folder), leave a comment that says, &quot;I vote for station #2.&quot;\n\nI will count the votes next week about this same time and my decision will be final if I can bring myself to make one.\n\nHappy listening!\n\nLW#1: Every Breath You Take - The Police\n40:    Lawyers In Love - Jackson Browne\n39:    The Salt In My Tears - Martin Briley\n38:    The Border - America        \n37:    Always Something There To Remind Me - Naked Eyes     \n36:    Roll Me Away - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band     \n35:    I'll Tumble 4 Ya - Culture Club    \n34:    Affair Of The Heart - Rick Springfield\n33:    Beat It - Michael Jackson\n32:    Stop In The Name Of Love - The Hollies\n31:    China Girl - David Bowie\n30:    Rock 'N' Roll Is King - ELO\n29:    Rock Of Ages - Def Leppard    \n28:    Saved By Zero - The Fixx\n27:    Take Me To Heart - Quarterflash\n26:    Wishing - A Flock Of Seagulls\n25:    It's A Mistake - Men At Work\n24:    (Keep Feeling) Fascination - The Human League\nLDD: Shame On The Moon - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band\n23:    She's A Beauty - The Tubes\n22:    Family Man - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n21:    Hot Girls In Love - Loverboy\n20:    Cuts Like A Knife - Bryan Adams\n19:    Maniac - Michael Sembello\n18:    Don't Let It End - Styx\n17:    All This Love - DeBarge\n16:    Baby Jane - Rod Stewart\n15:    Sweet Dreams - Eurythmics\n14:    She Works Hard For The Money - Donna Summer\n13:    1999 - Prince\n12:    I'm Still Standing - Elton John\n11:    Stand Back - Stevie Nicks\n10:    Time - Culture Club\n9:    Is There Something I Should Know - Duran Duran\n8:    Our House - Madness\nLDD: Hello Again - Neil Diamond\n7:    Too Shy - Kajagoogoo\n6:    Come Dancing - The Kinks\n5:    Wanna Be Startin' Something - Michael Jackson\n4:    Never Gonna Let You Go - Sergio Mendes\n3:    FlashdanceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.What A Feeling - Irene Cara\n2:    Electric Avenue - Eddie Grant\n1:    Every Breath You Take - The Police","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7283c02c9d85411fa848d8c31ce89c500be8a20b","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1983_July_16th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7283c02c9d85411fa848d8c31ce89c500be8a20b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,131,192,44,157,133,65,31,168,72,216,195,28,232,156,80,11,232,162,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
