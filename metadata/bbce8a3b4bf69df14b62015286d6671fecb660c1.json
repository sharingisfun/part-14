Twisted Road\n\nReview from agonyshorthand.blogspot.com:\n\nSo here we are with the 1980 Flesh Eaters debut, ?No Questions Asked?, packaged with their debut 7?EP ?Disintegration Nation?, three tracks from a the awesome Chris D.-helmed LA punk compilation ?Tooth and Nail?, and three more rare demos procured from the teeming Flesh Eaters tape collection of Byron Coley. Is that friggin? great, or what? And it?s funny, I feel after listening to this complete package a few times that I?ve probably never given ?No Questions Asked? the stand-alone respect it deserves. Sure, I?ve always loved the thing and played the grooves off my LP ? there?s nary a duff track on here (I even like the fake dub of ?Cry Baby Killer? most of the time), and it?s a blistering bag of hot-tempered, raw LA punk rock with understated guitar and the LP-length debut of Chris D.?s award-winning hothouse vocals. But of their four records, it was always my fourth favorite due to its cobbled-together, multiple-lineup nature, which renders it a bit scattered when stacked next to the cohesive, major-league whomp of the other three. ?No Questions Asked? takes a bunch of different Flesh Eaters live lineups from 1978-79, throws in a few LA punk/new wave-era heavyweights (Tito Larriva, Stan Ridgeway, Karla ?Mad Dog? whatever her name was) as ?session? musicians, and where it suffers at all, it?s in the lack of sheer rocks-out raw power that they made into a trademark just one record later. But man, the proverbial apples and oranges, right? It?s just an incredible slasher of an album, with all-time killers like ?Police Gun Jitters?, ?Dominoes?, ?Crazy Boy?, ?The Child Comes First? and the razor-sharp title track. It?s a ?punk? album very much in keeping with its era and peers, but something about it speaks to a whole ?nuther musical/lyrical language being shaped and articulated by Chris D., a guy who comes about as close to a ?poet? as any hard-drinking 70s punk ever did. In other words, in reading his lyrics, I find little if anything to be embarrassed about; on the contrary, there are some wild, feverish verses on here that speak to a man with a bizarrely fascinating and ultra-imaginative mind, and the means to assemble it into spat-out word clusters that make a crazy sort of (non)sense.
