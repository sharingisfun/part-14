They have been ripped from the DVD release &quot;Let's Be Brave&quot; (2006). The titles are as follows:\n\nCalling Dr. Zak\nMusical Scales\nSounds Like Trouble\nStormy Weather\nThe Big Sleepover\n\nSongs:\nBetcha' Can\nHum\nSpeak Up\n\nBoth the full episodes and the songs have only an English audio track. The episodes are dubbed in Spanish and the alternate track made available through the SAP feature when they air on television, but for some reason this DVD release is English-only. Please seed if you have the means--my connection is only 50kB up.\n\nVideo: 1474-3206 Kbps, 640*480 (4:3) at 29.970 fps, MPEG-4 (XviD)\nAudio: 128 Kbps, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, MPEG (MP3) (Version 1) Layer-3, Joint stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c32058fa9d20589fdda650327380b26f3075a78","amp;dn":"Dragon+Tales+Disc+%5C%22Let%5C%27s+Be+Brave%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c32058fa9d20589fdda650327380b26f3075a78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,50,5,143,169,210,5,137,253,218,101,3,39,56,11,38,243,7,90,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
