Ron scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses.\n\nAnd yet, as with all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to ApparateÃ¢â‚¬â€and lose a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.\n\nSo it's the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord VoldemortÃ¢â‚¬â€and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ee39598d05221e6f63b45a31a9a41a64e2a70b7","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+The+Half-Blood+Prince+-+J.K.+Rowling.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ee39598d05221e6f63b45a31a9a41a64e2a70b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,227,149,152,208,82,33,230,246,59,69,163,26,154,65,166,78,42,112,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
