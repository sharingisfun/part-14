The pair always inhabited the more polished end of the folk-rock spectrum and was sometimes criticized for a certain collegiate sterility. Many also feel that Simon, as both a singer and songwriter, didn't truly blossom until he began his own hugely successful solo career in the 1970s. But the best of S&amp;G's work can stand among Simon's best material, and the duo did progress musically over the course of their five albums, moving from basic folk-rock productions into Latin rhythms and gospel-influenced arrangements that foreshadowed Simon's eclecticism on his solo albums.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/simon-garfunkel-p5431/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/simon-garfunkel-p5431/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nThe three-disc box set Collected Works contains all of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's studio albums, from Wednesday Morning, 3 AM to Bridge Over Troubled Water. Though this is too much material for casual fans, any serious fan of Simon &amp; Garfunkel or folk-rock will need to acquire the set, simply because it presents the albums in their best-ever sound. The duo did record a handful of tracks that didn't make the set -- and if Columbia were assembling a true &quot;collected works&quot; compilation, they would have to be included -- but the genuinely essential material is present, making it a good buy for the budget conscious.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/collected-works-r18003&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/collected-works-r18003&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000026VB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000026VB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
