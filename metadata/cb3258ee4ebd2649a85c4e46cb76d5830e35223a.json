Tyler Connolly (vocals/guitar) reportedly slipped a copy of the band's demo to Kroeger at a post-concert party and the two were soon collaborating on songs together. One of these, &quot;Invisible Man,&quot; was used as the B-side for 2002's wildly successful Spider-Man theme &quot;Hero&quot; (a Kroeger collaboration with Saliva singer Josey Scott), and anticipated Theory of a Deadman's self-titled debut the same year. Also featuring Dave Brenner (guitar), Dean Back (bass), and Tim Hart (drums), the album's hook-laden, emotional hard rock sounded very similar to their celebrity benefactor's band; almost disturbingly so, actually. But a healthy touring work load and simple maturation ultimately helped Theory of a Deadman break out of that confining stylistic box for their more varied and distinctive sophomore effort, Gasoline, which was recorded with session drummer Robin Diaz. The trio later tapped veteran journeyman Brent Fitz (formerly of Union and Vince Neil's solo band) as their new permanent touring drummer. Theory of a Deadman returned to the studio in 2007 to record their third album, Scars and Souvenirs, which was produced by Howard Benson. The album was released in April 2008, and was certified gold in less than a year. The hard-hitting Canadian rockers fourth studio album, The Truth Is..., which was preceded by the single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lowlife,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ dropped on July 12, 2011, and was followed by a co-headlining tour with Alter Bridge under the banner the Carnival of Madness, which also included Adelitas Way, Black Stone Cherry, and Emphatic. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nTheory Of A Deadman (2002)\n\nRoadrunner Records\n168 618 421-2\nAudiochecker 99.90% CDDA\n\n\nGasoline (2005)\n\nRoadrunner Records\n168 618 323-2\nAudiochecker 99.92% CDDA\n\n\nScars &amp; Souvenirs (2008)\n\nRoadrunner Records\nRR 8009-2\nAudiochecker 99.92% CDDA\n\n\nThe Truth IsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦[Special Edition] (2011)\n\nRoadrunner Records\nRR-7729-5\nAudiochecker 99.83% CDDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb3258ee4ebd2649a85c4e46cb76d5830e35223a","amp;dn":"Theory+Of+A+Deadman+-+4+CD%27s+2002-2011+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb3258ee4ebd2649a85c4e46cb76d5830e35223a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,50,88,238,78,189,38,73,168,92,78,70,203,118,213,131,14,53,34,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
