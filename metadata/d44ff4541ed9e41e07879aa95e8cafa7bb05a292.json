It is often rational to act against our own best interests, he argues, and most of us have moral views that are self-defeating. We often act wrongly, although we know there will be no one with serious grounds for complaint, and when we consider future generations it is very hard to avoid conclusions that most of us will find very disturbing.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Very few works in the subject can compare with Parfit's in scope, fertility, imaginative resource, and cogency of reasoning.&quot;--P.F. Strawson, The New York Review of Books\n\n&quot;Complex, brilliant, and entertaining....This book is chock-full of impressive arguments, many of which seem destined to become part of the standard analytic repertory....It is an understatement to say that it is well worth reading.&quot;--International Studies in Philosophy\n\n&quot;Extraordinary...Brilliant...Astonishingly rich in ideas...A major contribution to philosophy: it will be read, honoured, and argued about for many years to come.&quot;--Samuel Scheffler, Times Literary Supplement\n\n&quot;A brilliantly clever and imaginative book...Strange and excitingly intense.&quot;--Alan Ryan, Sunday Times (London)\n\n&quot;Not many books reset the philosophical agenda in the way that this one does....Western philosophy, especially systematic ethics, will not be the same again.&quot;--Philosophical Books\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nDerek Parfit is a research fellow at All Souls College.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d44ff4541ed9e41e07879aa95e8cafa7bb05a292","amp;dn":"Derek+Parfit+-+Reasons+and+Persons+%5B1986%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d44ff4541ed9e41e07879aa95e8cafa7bb05a292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,79,244,84,30,217,228,30,7,135,154,169,94,140,175,167,187,5,162,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
