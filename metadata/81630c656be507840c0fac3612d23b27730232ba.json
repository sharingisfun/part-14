Available separately or as a part of the SOLID MIX SERIES bundle, SOLID DYNAMICS delivers clear, musical results via a clean and easy-to-use new interface. Now running as a stand-alone plug-in in any DAW, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been easier to master your dynamics.\n\n* All-in-one tool for total control over dynamics\n* Add professional punch and clarity in seconds\n* Runs as a stand-alone plug-in in any DAW\n\nCLEAN AND WARM\n\nSOLID DYNAMICS is a clean, responsive, and musical effect for a wide range of uses, particularly drums, vocals and gating noise floors. The compressor delivers a healthy combination of clean and warm with three simple controls: Ratio, Threshold and Release. The knee characteristic is switchable from soft to hard, and you can also switch between two attack modes (slow and fast) and two release modes (linear and logarithmic).\n\nThe expander/gate module allows you to manage the noise floor on a track to eliminate unwanted background noise such as headphone bleed. A gate is also extremely useful for making drums sound more direct, and you can use multiple gates to control bleed levels across multiple mics.\n\n\n\n\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\nWindows: Windows 8, Windows 7 (latest Service Pack, 32/64 Bit), Intel Core Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\n\nFor use with Any host / DAW as a plug-in\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n[Update]\n1.Burn or mount the image.\n2.Install the update.\n3.Enjoy!\n\n[New Install]\n1.Run our NI_InstReg tool.\n2.Burn or mount the image.\n3.Install.\n4.Enjoy!\n\n\nCode\nAAX Plugin is patched : You need cracked AAX Host to use.\nThis release is update and requires previous versions installed.\nHowever, we included the tool to install the update without that.\nCheck R2R.txt for further information.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
