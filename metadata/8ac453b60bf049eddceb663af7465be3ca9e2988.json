Only a select few have ever had access to the truth about what became known as Area 51.\n\nBut what happened to the remnants of that crash is shrouded in even greater mystery. What began in the high desert of New Mexico ended at Wright-Patterson, an ultra top-secret Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio. The physical evidence of extraterrestrial visitation was buried deep within this nuclear stronghold.\n\nHow tragic that such seismic news should be kept from the people of the world...pieces of history, now quickly dwindling into oblivion as the last of the secret-keepers passes on.\n\nIn spite of its rich history of military service to our nation, Wright-Patterson also stands as the secret tomb of one of the greatest occurrences in recorded history. But be prepared...the real Area 51--Wright-Patterson's vault--is about to be opened.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac453b60bf049eddceb663af7465be3ca9e2988","amp;dn":"Inside+the+Real+Area+51+++%282013+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac453b60bf049eddceb663af7465be3ca9e2988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,196,83,182,11,240,73,237,220,235,102,58,247,70,91,227,202,158,41,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
