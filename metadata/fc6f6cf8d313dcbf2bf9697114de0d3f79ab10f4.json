Left a quadraplegic after an auto accident, the embittered Dreyfuss feels utterly useless, as both an artist and a human being. He doesn't want his family's love, or his doctor's care, or his nurse's ministrations. Dreyfuss simply wants to die-but this is impossible, given the legal state of things in the 1970s. Whose Life is It Anyway? may be the only film in which a person's right to self - destruction is regarded as a happy ending. Not as depressing as it sounds, Whose Life Is It Anyway is perversely hilarious at times, with Dreyfuss at his acerbic best. The film was scripted by Reginald Rose and Brian Clark from Clark's stage play.\n\n\n\nAVI INFO:\n\n************************************\n\n- Duration: 1h 58mn\n\n- Codec: XVID\n\n- Bit rate: 1557 Kbps\n\n- Res: 640 x 272 pixels\n\n- AR: 2.35:1\n\n- Frame rate: 23.976 fps\n\n- Audio: AC3, 2 channels, 128 Kbps\n\n************************************\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc6f6cf8d313dcbf2bf9697114de0d3f79ab10f4","amp;dn":"Whose+Life+Is+It+Anyway+1981+DVDRip+XviD+titler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc6f6cf8d313dcbf2bf9697114de0d3f79ab10f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,111,108,248,211,19,220,191,43,249,105,113,20,222,13,63,121,171,16,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
