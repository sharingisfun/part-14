Feared and hunted by the powers in Rome, the lovers choose to die by their own hands as the triumphant armies of AntonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revengeful rival, Octavian, sweep into Egypt. Their three orphaned children are taken in chains to Rome; only twoÃ¢â‚¬â€œ the ten-year-old twins Selene and AlexanderÃ¢â‚¬â€œsurvive the journey. Delivered to the household of OctavianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister, the siblings cling to each other and to the hope that they will return one day to their rightful place on the throne of Egypt. As they come of age, they are buffeted by the personal ambitions of OctavianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family and court, by the ever-present threat of slave rebellion, and by the longings and desires deep within their own hearts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63a6671527d8133a6c2fc37109017f6cb8f70a0f","amp;dn":"Cleopatra%27s+Daughter+-+Michelle+Moran.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63a6671527d8133a6c2fc37109017f6cb8f70a0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,166,103,21,39,216,19,58,108,47,195,113,9,1,127,108,184,247,10,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
