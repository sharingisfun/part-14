You can also \n   copy words from Clue into other programs. There are Clue dictionaries \n   for several different languages and in varieties ranging from simple \n   dictionaries to specialized technical, economic and medical \n   dictionaries.\n   \n   All dictionaries work in exactly the same way; a single Clue program \n   can access as many dictionaries as you like. Which dictionary is to be \n   used is something you can choose very simply from a menu listing all \n   the dictionaries you have installed. You can also switch from \n   dictionary to dictionary by pressing the tab key. By pressing tab + \n   shift you can return to the dictionary you used last.\n   \n   Clue is extremely user-friendly and you will very rarely need to use \n   the help menu. However, it may be useful to take a look as you may \n   find that the program  has more capabilities than you previously \n   realized.\n   \n   The words that you look up in Clue can be copied quickly to other \n   Windows programs you are working in simultaneously simply by \n   double-clicking on the word.\n   \n   You can look words up quickly in Clue. Your use of language will \n   improve by using Clue every time you are in doubt about a translation \n   of a word.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38446efc964330d117d0833a2e9daf285f160e6f","amp;dn":"Clue.v6.4.Incl.Keygen-ORiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38446efc964330d117d0833a2e9daf285f160e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,68,110,252,150,67,48,209,23,208,131,58,46,157,175,40,95,22,14,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
