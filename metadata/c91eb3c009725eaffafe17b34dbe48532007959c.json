She is Vice President of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, serves on the Canadian National Police Services Advisory Council, and is one of only fifty-six forensic anthropologists certified by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology. A professor of anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Dr. Reichs now divides her time between Charlotte and Montreal. Deja Dead, her debut novel, brought her fame when it became a New York Times bestseller and won the 1997 Ellis Award for Best First Novel. In 2007 Break No Bones was short- listed for the Ellis Award for Best Novel. Kathy Reichs is the inspiration for the television drama Bones\n\n\nThis Torrent contains the following audio books:\n\n\nTemperance Brennan 01 - Deja Dead\nTemperance Brennan 02 - Death Du Jour\nTemperance Brennan 03 - Deadly Decisions\nTemperance Brennan 04 - Fatal Voyage\nTemperance Brennan 05 - Grave Secrets\nTemperance Brennan 06 - Bare Bones\nTemperance Brennan 07 - Monday Morning\nTemperance Brennan 08 - Cross Bones\nTemperance Brennan 09 - Break No Bones\nTemperance Brennan 10 - Bones to Ashes\nTemperance Brennan 11 - Devil Bones\nTemperance Brennan 12 - 206 Bones\nTemperance Brennan 13 - Spider Bones\nTemperance Brennan 14 - Flash and Bones\nand also\nTory Brennan 01 - Virals\nTory Brennan 02 - Seizure\n\nAgain, these are not my rips - they are books I have downloaded from others in the past.

I listen to a ton of audio books and have been grateful to be able to find downloads in the past.  I am hopeful I will be able to add Bones are Forever soon.\n\nThank you to the original uploaders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c91eb3c009725eaffafe17b34dbe48532007959c","amp;dn":"Kathy+Reichs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c91eb3c009725eaffafe17b34dbe48532007959c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,30,179,192,9,114,94,175,250,254,23,179,77,190,72,83,32,7,149,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
