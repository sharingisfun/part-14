Produced beautifully by Bruce Bromberg and Dennis Walker, the set sports some gorgeous originals (&quot;Phone Booth,&quot; &quot;Bad Influence,&quot; &quot;So Many Women, So Little Time&quot;) and two well-chosen covers, Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson's &quot;Don't Touch Me&quot; and Eddie Floyd's Stax-era &quot;Got to Make a Comeback.&quot; Few albums portend greatness the way this one did. [This edition included two bonus tracks.] \n\nPersonnel: Robert Cray (vocals, guitar); Albert Clemens (vocals); Warren Rand (saxophone, alto saxophone); Mike Vannice (saxophone, tenor saxophone, keyboards); Dave Olson (drums); David Li (percussion); Night Train Clemons, Tony Matthews, Phillip Walker, Tony Mathews (background vocals).[/color]\n\n\n1.
