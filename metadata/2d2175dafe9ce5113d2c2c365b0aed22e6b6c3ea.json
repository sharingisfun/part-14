Boilers: A Practical Reference is the result of those requests, providing a user-friendly encyclopedic format with more than 500 entries and nearly the same number of supporting illustrations.\n\nWritten for practicing engineers and dealing with practical issues rather than theory, this reference focuses exclusively on water tube boilers found in process industries and power plants. It provides broad explanations for the following topics:\n\n\n\nA range of boilers and main auxiliaries, as well as steam and gas turbines\n\nTraditional firing techniquesÃ¢â‚¬â€grates, oil/gas, and modern systems\n\nIndustrial, utility, waste heat, MSW and bio-fuel-fired boilers, including supercritical boilers\n\nThe scientific fundamentals of combustion, heat transfer, fluid flow, and more\n\nThe basics of fuels, water, ash, high-temperature steels, structurals, refractory, insulation, and more\n\nAdditional engineering topics like boiler instruments, controls, welding, corrosion, and wear\n\nAir pollution, its abatement techniques and their effect on the design of boilers and auxiliaries\n\nEmerging technologies such as carbon capture, oxy-fuel combustion, and PFBC\n\n\nThis reference covers almost every topic needed by boiler engineers in process and power plants. An encyclopedia by design and a professional reference book by focus and size, this volume is strong on fundamentals and design aspects as well as practical content. The scope and easy-to-navigate presentation of the material plus the numerous illustrations make this a unique reference for busy design, project, operation, and consulting engineers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d2175dafe9ce5113d2c2c365b0aed22e6b6c3ea","amp;dn":"Boilers+A+Practical+Reference+-+Kumar+Rayaprolu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d2175dafe9ce5113d2c2c365b0aed22e6b6c3ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,33,117,218,254,156,229,17,61,44,44,54,91,10,237,34,230,182,195,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
