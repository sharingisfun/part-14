But things appear to brighten up when he signs up promising new talent Joel (Ike Hamilton) who'll score the goals to get them further up the table. But Frankie's agent son Martin (Danny Dyer) has undercut the lad, and when Joel finds out about this, the relationship between all three of them turns sour. Joel starts to become corrupted by his new life of instant fame and fortune, Martin's reputation gets smeared in the mud and Frankie clings on like a dog to a bone to the club that he's failing to manage. In the devious, money making machine modern football has become, everyone is devious and no-one can be trusted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef90efbedd853251b57a813667254fcd119efeb","amp;dn":"All+In+The+Game+%282006%29+Danny+Dyer%2CRay+Winstone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef90efbedd853251b57a813667254fcd119efeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,249,14,251,237,216,83,37,27,87,168,19,102,114,84,252,209,25,239,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
