The series is titled Deutsche Grammophon Recomposed, and it led off with the album of famous German producer and musician Matthias Arfmann, who is known for having worked with Patrice, Yello, Jan Delay and Absolute Beginner. His style is rooted in reggae, dub, and hip-hop.\n\nDeutsche Grammophon Recomposed revisits a tradition that was already omnipresent in the time of Bach: reworking and re-processing a musical work in order to appeal to contemporary listeners.\n\nArfmann has chosen a number of prestigious recordings from DG's catalogue recorded by none other than Herbert von Karajan and the Berliner Philharmoniker, including pieces such as Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 &quot;From the New World&quot;, Wagner's Overture to &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;, Albinoni's &quot;Adagio&quot; and Tchaikovsky's &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. These great recordings were infused with baselines, rhythms, and in some cases, texts. The result is a soulful blend of familiar melodies in multiple sonic layers - a completely new take on beloved classical works that brings out their original beauty in a completely new way.\n\nArtists: Matthias Arfmann.\nComposers: Albinoni, Dvorak, Holst, Mendelssohn, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Schubert, Smetana, Tchaikovsky.\nConductors: Herbert von Karajan.\nOrchestras: Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.\nRECOMPOSED\nExcerpts from Classical Masterpieces Remixed and Arranged by Matthias Arfmann\n\nRIMSKY-KORSAKOV: Sheherazade Op. 35 - Symphonic Suite\nHOLST: The Planets Op. 32 - 1.
