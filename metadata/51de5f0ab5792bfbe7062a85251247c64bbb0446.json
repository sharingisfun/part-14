The real reason it was removed was because the app interfered with Google's ads business - Google weren't making much money because the app blocks all ads not only from Google, but also their affiliates and other ads networks.\n\nSchÃƒÂ¼rmann no longer release an Android package (APK) for AdAway, but he still participate in its development. You can find AdAway source codes at https://github.com/dschuermann/ad-away.
