She is shy and extremely reserved. Without any real prospects for the future or ambition, she lives with her sick mother whom she takes care of. Every evening, she hangs out with Veronica, age 37, whose expansive, wild personality is diametrically opposed to her own. She is also friends with Marta, a somewhat retarded girl who tries by any and all means to win Ana's love. Accused of theft, Ana is dismissed from her job as cashier in the village grocer's shop. Now unemployed, she doesn't know what to do. Veronica finds her work with Toro, a 45-year-old man who leads a solitary existence outside the village. He is a recluse, a stranger, and no one knows much about him. Ana will soon become his only link with the outer world. Each of the characters will trace his or her own path, by confronting the other characters, and try to find salvation in love, sex or family affection, not so much to assuage their deep solitude as to (re)discover themselves. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : El Cielo la Tierra y la Lluvia 2008.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 395 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate : 1 258 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.163\n      Stream size : 1 010 MiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 103 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 67 ms (2.00 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.98r\n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 -b 128\n      Language : Spanish\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135965/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135965/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpanish audio; English, French and Portuguese subtitles\n\nCredits to pasakor, who posted the film at KG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:092e2df9414690beb78302f769dfdbbfb53da513","amp;dn":"El+Cielo+la+Tierra+y+la+Lluvia+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"092e2df9414690beb78302f769dfdbbfb53da513","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,46,45,249,65,70,144,190,183,131,2,247,105,223,219,191,181,61,165,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
