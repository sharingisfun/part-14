Now, they've partnered to create a new textbook, a re-envisioning of the course, focused on conceptual understanding and inquiry-based learning. Investigating Astronomy: A Conceptual Approach to the Universe is a brief, 15-chapter text that employs a variety of activities and experiences to encourage students to think like a scientist. The authors engaged the help of hundreds of instructors to determine not only which concepts should be taught but how much depth in which to explain them. When they asked introductory astronomy instructors about the reasons current textbooks do not meet their needs, the results were clear: instructors felt current textbooks held too much information, and did not properly address the student issues in dealing with maths. With this feedback, plus the results conversations, workshops, and reviews, the authors have created thisunique textbook\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://static.bfwpub.com/BFWCatalog/Complete/Authors/207W/4754.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://static.bfwpub.com/BFWCatalog/Complete/Authors/207W/4754.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nTimothy F. Slater, Ph.D., is a professor at the University of Wyoming where he holds the Wyoming Excellence in Higher Education Endowed Chair for Science Education. At the University of Wyoming, he and his graduate students conduct education research on the teaching science. He is the Director of the Center for Astronomy &amp; Physics Education Research CAPER Team where his research focuses on student conceptual understanding in formal and informal learning environments, inquiry-based curriculum development, and authentic assessment strategies, with a particular emphasis on non-science majors and pre-service teachers. He is an author on nearly 100 articles and books, winner of numerous awards, and is frequently an invited speaker on improving teaching of science through educational research and improving teacher education and the popularization of science and astronomy. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://static.bfwpub.com/BFWCatalog/Complete/Authors/207W/4073262.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://static.bfwpub.com/BFWCatalog/Complete/Authors/207W/4073262.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nRoger A. Freedman is a Lecturer in Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. At UCSB, Dr. Freedman has taught in both the Department of Physics and the College of Creative Studies, a branch of the university intended for highly gifted and motivated undergraduates. He has published research in nuclear physics, elementary particle physics, and laser physics. He is co-author of three introductory textbooks: University Physics (Pearson), Universe (Freeman), and Investigating Astronomy (Freeman).\nDr. Freedman holds a commercial pilot's license. He was one of the early organizers of the San Diego Comic-Con, now the world's largest popular culture convention.\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\n1. Predicting the Motions of the Stars, Sun and Moon 1\n2.
