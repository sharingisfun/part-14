Berry's the curvaceous bait who lures Jackman into the scheme; Don Cheadle's an FBI agent hot on their tails; Sam Shepard is a corrupt Senator: and Jackman's daughter (Camryn Grimes) is an innocent bargaining chip.\n  If you're looking for an &quot;action popcorn&quot; flick with lots of bad guys, gunplay, quick camera movements, fun action sequences and a surprisingly decent storyline that moves along at a quick pace, this movie's for you.\n\n  NOTE: This movie starts out like bad TV reception (and ends the same way). So, there is nothing wrong with your Movie Player or this AVI.\n\n  Starring: John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, Sam Shepard, Camryn Grimes. \n\n  Directed by: Dominic Sena.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 39min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9e60c75c80188ea0afb1628e60e6e6fad86ea53","amp;dn":"Swordfish+%282001%29+%28John+Travolta%2C+Hugh+Jackman%2C+Halle+Berry%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9e60c75c80188ea0afb1628e60e6e6fad86ea53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,230,12,117,200,1,136,234,10,251,22,40,230,14,110,111,173,134,234,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
