Their only hope lies in a band of insurgents who made an arduous trek across the Ardus to seek the aid of a king Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nPlagued by grief, seventeen year-old Drastona Consta-Mayria becomes a leader for her people, the voice of the common folk, the forest, and the dragons.

HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a man existing in the shadow of tragedy. But there is hope in his magic, hope in the way he fights, and hope in what he can do for his country.\n\nWar has been declared between Sadeemia and Medeisia, a war led by rebels and aided by a king. But can the rebels survive the court of Sadeemia? For in the magnificent marble halls lies betrayal.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“People die so others may live.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nGenre: Romance | Fantasy | Adventure | Young Adult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:175427e6e362dfb0fb89952143ed9726e6c17cb8","amp;dn":"R.K.+Ryals+-+Fist+of+the+Furor+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"175427e6e362dfb0fb89952143ed9726e6c17cb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,84,39,230,227,98,223,176,251,137,149,33,67,237,151,38,230,193,124,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
