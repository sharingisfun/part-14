Their are \n\nechoes of marianne faithfull, bjork and maybe even the cranberries in places \n\nbut martha does sucessfully retain a good deal of her own personality in the \n\nsongs. \n\nThe 1st 4 tracks are my favourites , &quot;bloody motherfucking asshole&quot;  sounds a \n\nlittle too overwraught and gauche - who the fuck would swear like that anyway \n\n??! \n\nThe closing &quot;whither must i wander&quot; (a robert louis stevenson text) is pretty \n\nchamber-folk that closes  the record nicely after a couple of weaker songs, by \n\nshowing another dimension of her talents .  \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/26/martha-wainwright/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/26/martha-wainwright/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48b45150591b8c89b93756f6803f3232042e201d","amp;dn":"Martha+Wainwright...Martha+Wainwright%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48b45150591b8c89b93756f6803f3232042e201d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,180,81,80,89,27,140,137,185,55,86,246,128,63,50,50,4,46,32,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
