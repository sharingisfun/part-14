ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because malicious attackers now use an arsenal of tools to reverse-engineer, trace, and manipulate applications in ways that most programmers arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t aware of.\n\nThis guide illustrates several types of iOS attacks, as well as the tools and techniques that hackers use. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn best practices to help protect your applications, and discover how important it is to understand and strategize like your adversary.\n\nExamine subtle vulnerabilities in real-world applicationsÃ¢â‚¬â€and avoid the same problems in your apps\nLearn how attackers infect apps with malware through code injection\nDiscover how attackers defeat iOS keychain and data-protection encryption\nUse a debugger and custom code injection to manipulate the runtime Objective-C environment\nPrevent attackers from hijacking SSL sessions and stealing traffic\nSecurely delete files and design your apps to prevent forensic data leakage\nAvoid debugging abuse, validate the integrity of run-time classes, and make your code harder to trace","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ea5023afea84d193f52b9f9027b28afcd86ae87","amp;dn":"Hacking+and+Securing+iOS+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ea5023afea84d193f52b9f9027b28afcd86ae87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,165,2,58,254,168,77,25,63,82,185,249,2,123,40,175,205,134,174,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
