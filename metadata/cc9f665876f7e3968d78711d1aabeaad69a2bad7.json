Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets\n\nOrganized\n\nHigh Quality (160 KBPS)\n\nRipped from CDs\n\nRead by Jim Dale\n\nSeed....\n\nI spent hours upon hours organizing all seven of these books on my computer. They are all the same quality and all have their album arts. They are all also Mp3 files. They are NOT....WMA, MP4, or anything else. MP3s are compatible with everything, hence they should be the only thing used.\n\nI recomend using these with iTunes. Because Windows Media Player doesn't organize the same way iTubes does, and you will probably find that you hate it, because....well, you will just see for yourself. iTunes is great anyway.\n\n\nAgain, please seed, we can keep these torrents alive with your help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc9f665876f7e3968d78711d1aabeaad69a2bad7","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+the+Chamber+of+Secrets+Audio+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc9f665876f7e3968d78711d1aabeaad69a2bad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,159,102,88,118,247,227,150,141,120,113,29,26,171,234,173,105,162,186,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
