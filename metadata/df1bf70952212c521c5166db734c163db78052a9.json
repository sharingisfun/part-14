PowerISO has proprietary compression mechanism for creating smaller ISO images and that's DAA format. DAA compress ratio is directly comparable to RAR archive sizes.\n\n======================================================\n!WARNING!: All suffixes are changed from .daa to .iso due to &quot;filename error&quot; on TPB upload. True suffix is .daa, but if you install PowerISO (windows) it will open nevertheless. Users on Mac/Linux should change it back to .daa and use provided conversion tools.\n======================================================\n\n* OS dependent?\nIf you're using Windows OS than you should install PowerISO tool included in this package. Don't moan about it coz this is a perfect substitute for all bulky burning applications out there, like Nero. PowerISO lets you burn, create bootable ISO images (creating/manipulating boot images really works opposite to some other wannabe iso tools) and gives you virtual drive for all your mounting needs.\n\nUsers on MacOSX or Linux should use provided tools to convert .daa to .iso, originally found on URL: http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm\n\n* How to burn (PowerISO/Windows)? \nEasy. Just double click on .daa file and burn it on DVD. No need to extract! Recommended practice is to burn at slowest speed possible (lets say 4x) to avoid any possible errors resulting from higher burning speeds. Use well known blank DVDs as those are more reliable (Verbatim, Sony etc.) than cheap no-namers.\n\n* Which type of DVDs should you use (DVD-R or DVD+R)?\nWell, it doesn't really matter as long as you stick to quallity media. This is especially true for latest PS2 generations where both types of media plays just fine. There were some problems though in early PS2 generations resulting in faulty playback on DVD+R discs. So for sake of extreme compatibility go for DVD-R if you must choose.\n\n* Noob warning: \nDVD images will only work on modded PS2 like those with ModBo chip installed or are modified in some other (software) way! ModBo chip is tested to successfuly play both PAL and NTSC disc versions!\n\n* Size warning:\nNames of files are designated with standard DVD tags like DVD5 or DVD9 which is, as name suggests, the size of a disk. DVD5 means single layer DVD that can hold 4.7GB of data and DVD9 means dual layer DVD that can hold 8.54GB of data. In DAAmiT Collection there's only Bollywood disk in DVD9 size.\n\n* About Languages:\nAll disks in DAAmiT Collection have menus in English language except 3 disks:\nSingStar.PS2.HR.Rocks.[Cro.PAL.DVD5] which is in Croatian language,\nSingStar.PS2.Hottest.Hits.[De.PAL.DVD5] which is in German language,\nSingStar.PS2.Michael.Jackson.[Esp.PAL.DVD5] which is in Spanish language.\nMenus are straigtforward so this shouldn't be a big deal. There was multi-language version of Hottest Hits (MULTi5) but it just didn't work on our system.\n\n======================================================\nContent:\n\n* 19 x DAA(ISO) DVD IMAGES SingStar for PS2 (PAL/NTSC)\n* Tracklist covers in PDF format for easy printing\n* PowerISO tools for Windows/OSX/Linux\n======================================================\n\nThat's it. Get some!\n...and SHARE DAMN IT!\n\n***\nBrought 2u by sikci &amp; zimurg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df1bf70952212c521c5166db734c163db78052a9","amp;dn":"SingStar+PS2+DAAmiT+Collection+%5B19+disks%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df1bf70952212c521c5166db734c163db78052a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,27,247,9,82,33,44,82,28,81,102,219,115,76,22,61,183,128,82,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
