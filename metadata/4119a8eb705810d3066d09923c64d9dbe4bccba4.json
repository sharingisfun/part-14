Pictured on the cover near Tesla&amp;#039;s feet, the 187-foot Wardenclyffe Tower was the means to deliver natural 8 Hz electricity anywhere in the world, by longitudinal waves with only about 5% loss. See why Tesla&amp;#039;s dream answers the energy crisis worldwide, saves electrical conversion losses, and provides a real alternative to transmission lines. Why wasn&amp;#039;t the prototype of Wardenclyffe finished in 1903?\nAs Tesla said: The world was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time. But the same laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success... Let the future tell the truth and evaluate each one according to their work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4119a8eb705810d3066d09923c64d9dbe4bccba4","amp;dn":"Valone-Harnessing+wheelwork+of+nature-Tesla%5C%27s+science+of+ener","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4119a8eb705810d3066d09923c64d9dbe4bccba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,25,168,235,112,88,16,211,6,109,9,146,60,100,217,219,228,188,203,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
