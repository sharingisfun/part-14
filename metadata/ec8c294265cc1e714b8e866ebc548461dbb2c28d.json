At two discs and 28 tracks, The Essential falls somewhere between the fan-oriented excess of Music Bank and the just-the-basics Greatest Hits, offering all of the group's biggest songs -- not just singles like &quot;Man in the Box,&quot; &quot;Angry Chair,&quot; &quot;Rooster,&quot; &quot;No Excuses,&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot; but also album tracks like &quot;Sea of Sorrow,&quot; &quot;God Smack,&quot; &quot;Hate to Feel,&quot; and &quot;Dam That River&quot; -- in a comprehensive overview of their career. While this may be a little bit too long for those listeners who only want AIC's grunge staples -- conversely, there are certainly a handful of songs that diehards might miss -- this is nevertheless the best-executed Alice in Chains compilation yet, functioning well as an effective summary and introduction to their too-brief, complicated career.&quot; ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide\n\nFile Information:\n\nGeneral                    \nPerformer                        : Alice In Chains\nGenre                            : Grunge\nRecorded date                    : 2006\nAlbum                            : The Essential Alice In Chains - CD1/CD2\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : FLAC\nFormat/Info                      : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nDuration                         : 2:09:37\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nWriting library                  : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)\n\nDisc 1:\n1.
