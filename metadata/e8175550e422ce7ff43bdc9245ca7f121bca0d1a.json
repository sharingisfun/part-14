Sounds fantastic. We used the original 1630 master comp reel from the UK, bypassing the limited and over-the-top EQd cutting master that can kill small insects at 30 yards and I really enjoyed the listening experience. We can now hear into the mix and hear what is really going on deeeep inside the soundfield. Other versions of this album have so much treble EQ added in post that it really obscures the meat of the music to a great extent. No idea why they did that.\n\nI couldnt even play the old CD at any sustained volume level without literally getting a headache. This version reveals the complex layering of the music and vocals so the album will seem like a new experience for you (and me).\n\nI think youll be able to finally crank this album up the way it was meant to be cranked.\n\nNot my rip but verified with Audiochecker V1.2.  All tracks CDDA with probability 100%.
