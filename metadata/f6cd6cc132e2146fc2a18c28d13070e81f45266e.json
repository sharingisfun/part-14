The mix of jazz, Americana and popular themes on the self-penned album elevated the master of the banjo to new heights. With the help of Tony Rice (guitar), Jerry Douglas (dobro), Mark OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Connor (fiddle), Sam Bush (Mandolin), and Mark Schatz (bass), this group of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest purveyors of acoustic music produced a masterpiece. From the opening notes, this album is overflowing with a sonic landscape of instrumental mastery. This MFSL Discovery Series title has finally unearthed the incredible sonics achieved in the studio. Every instrument is portrayed in its most natural setting. This one is not to be believed! DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t miss this release!\n\nAbout the Album:\nThe original LP of this seminal album came out in 1988. It became Bela FleckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most popular recording and, 17 years later, probably still holds that position. To say that Drive crossed boundaries would be tame ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it galloped over them, its Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«newgrassÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» bluegrass style appealing to those who normally donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t care for the genre. Most of the titles are upbeat, finger-picking ear feasts that make good, er, driving music. But a few tracks, such as Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«The Lights of Home,Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» slow down a bit and allow the band to produce a sound resplendent with nostalgic, heartfelt twang. DriveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound has always been highly regarded, but this SACD is as close to perfection as weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re liable to get without actually being there. All the picked instruments can be heard with vivid realism, and the fiddles have uncanny presence. The bass is solid and focused without ever being too prominent. This recording can serve as a Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«how to do itÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» example for bluegrass and SACD producers alike.\nVoted Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«Best Hi-Rez RecordingÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» for 2005 by SoundStage.\n\nTracks list:\n1.
