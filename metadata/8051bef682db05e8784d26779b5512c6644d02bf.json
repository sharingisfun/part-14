No actors. No scripts.\nBack to where it began, with everyone. Following the overwhelming success\nof the Channel Seven telemovie INXS: Never Tear Us Apart, join Sunday\nNight for an exclusive look into the INXS story through the eyes of those who\nlived it. All five surviving members of the band sit down with reporter\nRahni Sadler - the Farriss Brothers Tim, Andrew and Jon, Kirk Pengilly, \nGarry Beers, as well as manager Chris Murphy - to tell one of the greatest\nrocknroll stories of all time. And nothing is off limits.

They open up about Michaels love affairs, the drugs, \nthe time an American record executive threatened to drop the band, and how \nthey really feel about Kylie Minogue, Paula Yates, Sir Bob Geldof and Tiger Lily.\nFeaturing archived photographs and memorabilia plus never-before-broadcast \nhome videos shot by the band while on tour, this is one extraordinary reunion\n                                                                    not to be missed.\n\nVideo: mp4\nAudo:  DOLBY  Pro  Logic II \nRunTime:  00:41:50","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8051bef682db05e8784d26779b5512c6644d02bf","amp;dn":"INXS+Special+%7E+In+Their+Own+Words.+mp4.+Dolby+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8051bef682db05e8784d26779b5512c6644d02bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,81,190,246,130,219,5,232,120,77,38,119,155,85,18,198,100,77,2,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
