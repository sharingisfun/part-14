Anything with Powell and Marks is worth checking out, it's as if they wanted to recreate the old Powell-Pressburger magic.\n\nMarks had been a spook himself, a cryptographer, so he must have had some knowledge of &quot;the game&quot;. This one is as much melodrama as thriller, as two enemy spies fall in love with each other; you can imagine Garbo playing this sort of thing in the 1930s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94119e1fd3389e1b2b2ed22cafc37f227c6fbc48","amp;dn":"Espionage%3A+A+Free+Agent+%28Michael+Powell%2C+1964%2C+TV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94119e1fd3389e1b2b2ed22cafc37f227c6fbc48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,17,158,31,211,56,158,27,43,46,210,44,175,195,127,34,124,111,188,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
