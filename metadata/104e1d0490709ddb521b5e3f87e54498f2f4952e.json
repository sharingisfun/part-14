His son, Pietre, steps forth to take the helm of the vast Russian Empire. Power-hungry and eager to display his might, the young prince turns his nation into the ultimate war machine. With overwhelming speed, Russia's forces storm through her neighbours and stand poised to conquer the world.\n\nAfter years of bloodshed and desperate to forestall total annihilation, the remaining free nations of the world form an alliance aimed at stopping the new Russian superpower--with you as its best hope for success.\n\nWelcome to the world of Codename Eagle, a romp through a parallel universe, where Russia is the reigning nation of the world. You are Red, a member of the &quot;Shadow Command,&quot; an elite commando unit assigned to halt Pietre's treachery. Succeed and you will be the world's saviour; fail and the planet will plunge into the chaos of world war.\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\n* 3D Environments Of The Russian Landscape\n\n* Play In Either 1st- Or 3rd-Person View--Or Both\n\n* Take Command Of A Huge Variety Of Trucks, Motorcycles, And Biplanes\n\n* Select From A Wide Array Of Tools And Weapons\n\n* 3D Engine Incorporates Real-World Physics\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\n                                System Requirements\n                                ===================\n\n\nPentium 266 Or Faster\n\nMicrosoft Windows 95, 98SE, 2000, XP (And Maybe Windows Vista)\n\n64 MB RAM\n\n4x Or Faster CD-ROM Drive\n\n16-Bit High-Color 3D Graphics (Supports Direct3D)\n\nWindows Compatible Sound And Video Cards\n\nMicrosoft Compatible Mouse/Keyboard\n\nELSPA Minimum Age: 15\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n                                Ripped By: Booster2\n                                ===================\n\n\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n                          Developed By Take 2 Interactive\n                          ===============================\n                          ===============================\n\n\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:104e1d0490709ddb521b5e3f87e54498f2f4952e","amp;dn":"Codename+Eagle+%281999-2000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"104e1d0490709ddb521b5e3f87e54498f2f4952e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,78,29,4,144,112,157,219,82,27,94,63,135,229,68,152,242,244,149,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
