When it comes to our health or state of mind, we ask ourselves and our doctors ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œam I normalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ hoping for a positive response.\n\nIn this series, Vivienne Parry finds out how the doctors decide whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in the normal box and whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not when it comes to weight, height, hearts, depression, cancer, madness, metabolism, autism and drinking.\n\nAnd if you don`t fit into the normal box, are you in need of medical treatment, or are you just different?\n\nNine episodes of approx thirty minutes each.\n\n\nProgramme 1 - Weight\nYou may have been told by your doctor that your weight is just fine, but be aware, they may soon change their minds.\n\nThirty million Americans became overweight, overnight when the US government changed the upper limit of a normal weight from a body mass index of 27 down to 25.\n\nCould giving children weight report cards every term help them to lose weight? It`s easy enough to label a child as overweight, or even obese: much less easy to live with the label.\n\n`Obese is just such a big horrible word` says nine year old, Sam.\n\n\nProgramme 2 - Height\nIs being short a medical condition or just a fact of life?\n\nTens of thousands of children worldwide now receive growth hormone treatment. Some are growth hormone deficient, a known medical condition. Others aren`t.\n\nIn the US, growth hormone has been approved for use on short but otherwise healthy children. The same could happen here.\n\nWe hear from an American dad who took his wife to court to try and stop his son from being given growth hormone. He lost.\n\n\nProgramme 3 - Heart\nIs your heart healthy? Is it normal? We join Vivienne Parry as she gets her cholesterol and blood pressure checked to find out her risk of heart disease.\n\nIf she were a smoker, stopping could cut her chances of having a heart attack by half. Her age and her family history are also risk factors, but there`s not much she can do about those.\n\nThese days there are tablets to control blood pressure, cholesterol and weight, and we know that these factors can all affect how healthy a heart is. But just because we can reduce those factors with drugs, should we?\n\nVivienne speaks to the cardiologists, pharmacists and GPs in her quest for normality - with or without a bit of pharmaceutical help.\n\n\nProgramme 4 - Depression\nHow do doctors decide if what`s going on inside someone`s head is normal?\n\nChecklists and questionnaires may help to assess whether or not someone is depressed. But when a teenager answers `yes` to `do you argue with your parents?` does that mean they need anti-depressants?\n\n`Giving someone a pill sends out a strong message that there`s something wrong with them that needs fixing` says psychiatrist Joanna Moncrieff.\n\n`What seems to one person an acceptable normality would seem to someone else intolerable`, says Andrew Solomon, author of The Noonday Demon: An Anatomy of Depression.\n\n\nProgramme 5 - Cancer\nIs it normal for us to have cancer? Public opinion might be that cancer is abnormal, but medical professionals disagree.\n\nTesting and screening is becoming more sensitive, picking up abnormal cancerous cells that may never develop into a life threatening disease.\n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re all living longer and cancer is a normal part of the ageing process.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf we all lived to be 200, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d all have cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Professor Karol Sikora of Imperial College London.\n\n\nProgramme 6 - Madness\nOne in 10 of us has had a mad or psychotic experience at some time in our life.\n\nWe might briefly but passionately believe that we are Jesus, or think the television is talking directly to us. Mad thoughts certainly but do they make us mad?\n\nUnder extreme stress, we all suffer physically and mentally. One in 4 of us will have a bout of madness. Most recover and life continues normally enough.\n\nDoes this make us mad - or normal?\n\n\nProgramme 7 - Metabolism\nWhat is a normal metabolism? Our thyroid controls our body temperature and therefore plays an important role in our metabolism.\n\nThe symptoms for an under-active thyroid are familiar to many of us ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tiredness, lethargy, weight gain, dull skin and hair.\n\nHow does your GP determine whether they are due to the stresses and strains of busy lives or symptoms of hypo-thyroidism?\n\nHow do existing medical guidelines deal with the fact that we are all `uniquely hormoned`, when what might be a `normal thyroid hormone level for you is not the case for someone else`.\n\n\nProgramme 8 - Asperger Syndrome and Autism\nTen times more children are diagnosed with autism or Asperger syndrome than 40 years ago.\n\nIs it because weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re better at spotting thsee conditions, are they more widespread or have the goalposts moved?\n\nMore children and adults with less obvious autistic characteristics are now being labelled as such. This may help those affected to access support and can lead to greater understanding from others.\n\nAt the same time, everybody wants to fit in.\n\n\nProgramme 9 - Alcohol\nBritain is a nation of drinkers. We now drink twice as much alcohol as 50 years ago, with scant regard to the recommended intake.\n\nAs our love of alcohol increases so does the rates of chronic liver disease, many types of cancer, strokes and damage to the brain.\n\nThe government focuses on the drinking problems of young people who visibly binge at the weekend. But health professionals believe so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnormalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ older drinkers are exceeding safe limits.\n\nAnd whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s normal when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re in your 20s is too much in your 60s, when your body canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t metabolise the alcohol as efficiently.\n\nVivienne Parry looks at the impact of drinking a couple of glasses of wine with a meal, and a few more at the Christmas party. She asks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIs my drinking normal?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and if it is normal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is it wise?\n\n_______________________\n\n\nType : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate : 128\nMode : joint stereo\nFrequency : 44100 Hz\nEncoder : Lame 3.95\n_______________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c77a3b4ecc822a92f9cea699d4d8c260ecb835d0","amp;dn":"Am+I+Normal+-+BBC+Radio+Medical+Documentary+Series+-+Seasons+1+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c77a3b4ecc822a92f9cea699d4d8c260ecb835d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,122,59,78,204,130,42,146,249,206,166,153,212,216,194,96,236,184,53,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
