While I am more able to provide current issues, IF I can find what you are looking for I will try and post it for you. Nemesis43 on KAT has far more resources than I and is a better bet, but I will do what I can to help the communities. Please message me privately for requests so as not to clutter up comment sections with unrelated material.\n\n\n\n\n\n#1 Welcome to the &quot;Chicago Organized Workers League&quot;- the world's first Super-Hero Labor Union! While C.O.W.L. once stood as a beacon of hope against an epidemic of organized crime and an unbeatable &quot;brotherhood&quot; of Super-Villains, the union now faces its fiercest foe yet-a disillusioned public. In targeting the last of the great villains, C.O.W.L. attempts to prove its value to the world and to each other, while staving off villainy from both outside and inside its offices. \n\n\n\n#2 Moles, murder, and mayhem. As C.O.W.L. prepares to enter negotiations with the city, scandal threatens the organization. Can The Grey Raven keep C.O.W.L. from tearing itself apart? Plus, what really happened between him and Sparrow?
