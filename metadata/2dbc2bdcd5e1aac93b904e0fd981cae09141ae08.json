Who we are and who we might be if we follow our dreams.&quot;\n\n-Miley Cyrus\n\nThree years ago, Miley Cyrus was a virtual unknown. Her life in rural Tennessee was filled with family, friends, school, cheerleading, and the daily tasks of living on a farm. And then came a little show called Hannah Montana. \n\nAlmost overnight, Miley would rocket to superstardom, becoming a television and singing phenomenon. Quiet days were replaced with sold-out concerts, television appearances, and magazine shoots. But through it all, Miley has remained close to her family and friends and has stayed connected to the Southern roots that made her so strong. \n\nIn Miles to Go, Miley offers an honest, humorous, and often touching story of one girl's coming-of-age--from private moments with her pappy to off-roading with her dad, Billy Ray, to her run-ins with mean girls. Miley talks about suffering through drama and heartbreak and coming out the other end unscathed (relatively). And now for the first time, she will discuss it all-the milestones still left to reach (driver's license! voting!), dreams to live out (travel to Asia! find true love!), and the lessons to be learned (remembering to enjoy every moment!). \n\nThis is a truly unique look inside the world of one of today's biggest and brightest stars as she tackles looking back and moving forward. \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dbc2bdcd5e1aac93b904e0fd981cae09141ae08","amp;dn":"Miles+To+Go+by+Miley+Cyrus+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dbc2bdcd5e1aac93b904e0fd981cae09141ae08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,188,43,220,213,225,170,201,59,144,78,15,217,129,202,224,145,65,174,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
