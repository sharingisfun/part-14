The author shows through case after case of credible whistleblower and extraterrestrial contact testimony, that had our leaders embarked on a policy of openness and transparency, rather than secrecy and cover-up, human evolution, would have moved forward instead of backward and the earthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s environment protected. \n\nThe author shows that about the time the Bilderberg group was founded in 1954, the European and American oligarchy chose to play to humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark side, deciding to selfishly and savagely protect its established interests and institutions, and its covert control over the masses, when confronted with alien contact. \n\nThe oligarchy chose to subvert democratic principles and the rule of law, in order to secretly monopolize extraterrestrial technologies, for immense profit, making this along with fiat money, a foundation stone of its covert global power. Under the guise of National Security, leaders and ordinary citizens that opposed the UFO/ET cover-up were discredited, harassed and in some cases murdered, under a covert policy of denial and ridicule.\n\nFantastic and shocking as it would seem to some, rather than lead mankind to an enlightened future offered to us by ethical extraterrestrial races and civilizations, our autocratic leaders agreed to secret Faustian treaties and technological transfer agreements with less ethical extraterrestrial races, thereby creating the greatest national security threat of all time.\n\nWe can only imagine our future, if overt space travel had become commonplace, with ethical ET cultural and technological exchanges bringing in a new age of enlightment, along with exotic cheap non-polluting energy and transportation, from reverse engineered alien technologies.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction / Exopolitics / UFO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29c151979455392319c38d9e22bd4c5dfef8dcb4","amp;dn":"UFOs+Exopolitics+and+the+New+World+Disorder+by+Ed+Komarek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29c151979455392319c38d9e22bd4c5dfef8dcb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,193,81,151,148,85,57,35,25,195,141,158,34,189,76,93,254,248,220,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
