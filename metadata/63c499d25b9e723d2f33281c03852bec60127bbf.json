Along with the rest of the comics industry, Valiant's sales soon slumped as the speculative boom collapsed, and Acclaim management took a more active role in publishing decisions.\n\nIn 1996, Acclaim relaunched the Valiant Comics line as Acclaim Comics, their primary motivation being to make the properties more suitable for use in video game development. This led to the creation of Shadowman and Turok Dinosaur Hunter video game franchises.\n\nIn 1999, Acclaim began publishing Unity 2000, written by Jim Shooter, intended to integrate the old Valiant universe and new Acclaim Universe. However the series was stopped after only three of its planned six issues, and all publication ceased two months later as Acclaim focused on its faltering core business. In 2004, Acclaim closed its offices and filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\nA torrent of Valiant titles is available via the link below: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5172366/Valiant_Comics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5172366/Valiant_Comics&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nReleased on: ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63c499d25b9e723d2f33281c03852bec60127bbf","amp;dn":"Acclaim+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63c499d25b9e723d2f33281c03852bec60127bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,196,153,210,91,158,114,61,47,51,40,28,3,133,43,236,96,18,123,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
