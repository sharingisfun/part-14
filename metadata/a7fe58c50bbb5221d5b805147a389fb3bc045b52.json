In 1971, Lynch moved to Los Angeles to attend the AFI Conservatory. At the Conservatory, Lynch began working on his first feature-length film, Eraserhead, using a $10,000 grant from the AFI. The grant was not sufficient to complete the film and, as a result, Lynch worked on Eraserhead intermittently until its release in 1977. Lynch used money from friends and family, including boyhood friend Jack Fisk, a production designer and the husband of actress Sissy Spacek, and from odd jobs to finish the film.\n\nThe film follows a short period of the life of Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a printer on vacation. Henry discovers that his estranged girlfriend, Mary X (Charlotte Stewart), has given birth to a bizarrely deformed baby. He marries her, and, after a tumultuous and brief time living together, Mary leaves Henry who then cares for the ill baby himself. A bizarre sequence of eventsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that have little to no explanation to how or why they happenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ensues, including visions of a woman in Henry's radiator dancing and stomping on small tadpole-like creatures, a tryst with the woman across the hall, and a dream sequence in which Henry's head is used to make pencil erasers.\n\nEraserhead polarized and baffled many critics and movie-goers, but has become a cult classic. In 2004, the film was deemed culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Lynch has called it a dream of dark and troubling things and his most spiritual movie.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Eraserhead (1977)[DVDRip][big_dad_e]\\Eraserhead (1977)[DVDRip][big_dad_e].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 852 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 28mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 342 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DIVX\nCodec ID/Info                    : Project Mayo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 4\nDuration                         : 1h 28mn\nBit rate                         : 1 200 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.116\nStream size                      : 762 MiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : avc2.0.11.1110\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 28mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 81.3 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5049\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/5/2010 5:32:57 AM\nmbam-log-2010-11-05 (05-32-57).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 0\nTime elapsed: 6 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n \n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more of my torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&lt;/a&gt;  (Secured)\n\nAll torrents scanned with:\nNorton Anti-virus\nMalwarebytes' Anti-malware\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pirate-party.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pirate-party.us/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nALWAYS SEED &amp; THANKS SEEDERS!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7fe58c50bbb5221d5b805147a389fb3bc045b52","amp;dn":"Eraserhead+%281976%29%5BDVDRip%5D%5Bbig_dad_e%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7fe58c50bbb5221d5b805147a389fb3bc045b52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,254,88,197,11,187,82,33,213,184,5,20,122,56,159,179,188,4,91,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
