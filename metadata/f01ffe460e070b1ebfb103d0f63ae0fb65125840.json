They hired Gypie Mayo, then set back out on the road. Over the next four years, the Feelgoods cranked out four studio albums (Be Seeing You, Private Practice, Let It Roll, A Case of the Shakes) and two live LPs (As It Happens, On the Job), all of which are gathered here, along with a bevy of rarities (a full, unreleased live set from Canvey Island in June 1977, seven live cuts from 1978, the final UA single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Waiting for Saturday NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½/Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Eileen,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the EP that came along with As It Happens) on 2013's Taking No Prisoners (With Gypie 1977-1981), a four-CDÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nset that documents what amounts to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one true stab at crossover success. Dr. Feelgood didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t change their sound at all Ã¢â‚¬â€ under the direction of lead singer Lee Brilleaux, the group remained indebted to hard R&amp;B, blues, and early British Invasion rock &amp; roll Ã¢â‚¬â€ but the feel was decidedly different. Without Wilko, the Feelgoods were lighter, tossing aside the tightly coiled menace for a bright, cheerful party. BrilleauxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growl still could seem nasty, especially when he was on-stage (the two live albums hit harder than the studio albums yet never slash like the classic 1976 Stupidity), but the chemistry had shifted, turning Feelgoods into something resembling a good-time party band. Along with the changing mindset came an expanded sonic palette, with horns and keyboards making an appearance alongside a host of other expansive studio tricks. Kindred spirit Nick Lowe gave the band a song called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Milk &amp; AlcoholÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1979, a tune that turned into their only Top 10 hit, then he produced A Case of the Shakes in 1980, and there are times that the colour and vibe of these EMI recordings brings to mind Rockpile, particularly as they have just the slightest high-gloss veneer and an easy embrace of hooks, but the group remains a driving rock &amp; roll band, not a pop group, not even when the label or producer pushed them in that direction. This loose adoption of fashion does mean the music on Taking No Prisoners feels tangentially new wave, which is a large part of this musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appeal; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not starkly timeless like All Through the City, but rather slightly trashy, the threads effortlessly evoking the time. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the fun, to hear the Feelgoods stretch out, flirt with pop, and find a comfortable groove they could ride for years. This music has gotten short shrift, as it was always compared to the Wilko Johnson years, but heard on its own terms, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tremendously fun collection of bright, raucous rock &amp; roll.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f01ffe460e070b1ebfb103d0f63ae0fb65125840","amp;dn":"Dr.+Feelgood+-+%5BBox%5D+Taking+No+Prisoners+%28with+Gypie+1977-1981%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f01ffe460e070b1ebfb103d0f63ae0fb65125840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,31,254,70,14,7,11,30,191,177,3,208,246,58,224,251,101,18,88,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
