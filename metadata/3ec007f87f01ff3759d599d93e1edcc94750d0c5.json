Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s available in a gift-worthy special edition with color photographs and illustrations depicting theoretical models of the planets and their orbitsÃ¢â‚¬â€making HawkingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant insights all the more accessible. This original compilation is based on seven classic works of physics and astronomy which, read in chronological order, trace the evolution of modern science.\n\nTHE ILLUSTRATED ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS includes selections from\n- On the Revolution of Heavenly Spheres by Nicolaus Copernicus;\n- Principia by Sir Isaac Newton;\n- The Principle of Relativity by Albert Einstein;\n- Dialogues Concerning Two Sciences by Galileo Galilei with Alfonso De Salvio;\n- Harmony of the World by Johannes Kepler.\n\nIt also includes five important critical essays and an original biography of each physicist, written by Hawking himself. Stephen HawkingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to make science understandable and compelling to a lay audience was established with the publication of his first book, A Brief History of Time, which has sold nearly 10 million copies in 40 languages. Hawking has authored or participated in the creation of numerous other popular science books, including On the Shoulders of Giants and The Illustrated On the Shoulders of Giants.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ec007f87f01ff3759d599d93e1edcc94750d0c5","amp;dn":"The+Illustrated+On+the++Shoulders+of+Giants+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ec007f87f01ff3759d599d93e1edcc94750d0c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,192,7,248,127,1,255,55,89,213,153,217,62,30,220,201,71,80,208,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
