The classified Japanese program required developing a squadron of top secret submarines--the Sen-toku or I-400 class--which were, by far, the largest and among the most deadly subs of World War II. Incredibly, the subs were designed as underwater aircraft carriers, each equipped with three Aichi M6A1 attack bombers painted to look like US aircraft. The bombers, called Seiran (which translates as Ã¢â‚¬Å“storm from a clear skyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), were tucked in a huge, water tight hanger on the subÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deck. The subs mission was to travel more than half way around the world, surface on the US coast, and launch their deadly air attack. This entire operation was unknown to US intelligence, despite having broken the Japanese naval code. And the amazing thing is how close the Japanese came to pulling off their mission. \n\n Meticulously researched and masterfully told, Operation Storm tells the harrowing story of the Sen Toku, their desperate push into Allied waters, and the dramatic chase of this juggernaut sub by the US navy. Author John GeogheganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first person accounts from the last surviving members of both the I-401 crew and the US boarding party that captured her create a highly intimate portrait of this fascinating, and until now forgotten story of war in the Pacific.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3b5d6861bbc16eeff2668898062bbcb91c48bb1","amp;dn":"Operation+Storm%3A+Japan%27s+Top+Secret+Submarines+and+Its+Plan+to+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3b5d6861bbc16eeff2668898062bbcb91c48bb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,181,214,134,27,188,22,238,255,38,104,137,128,98,187,203,145,196,139,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
