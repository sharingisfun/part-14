Here Miller abandoned his edge and his rootsy sensibilities, and leaned toward a lighter, more melodic approach. This is typified in the title track, a shuffling groover with an infectiously hooky chorus that went on to become a monstrous smash, and something of a signature song for Miller.\n\nWhile &quot;The Joker&quot; is the centerpiece of the album the be-bop ditty &quot;Shu Ba Da Du Ma Ma Ma Ma,&quot; the humorous &quot;Your Cash Ain't Nothin' But Trash,&quot; and the underrated Miller composition &quot;Sugar Babe&quot; are also noteworthy. The Joker is most interesting as a look at Miller in transition: it contains many of the elements that would go on to make him a superstar over the course of his next two releases, \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1  Sugar Babe  4:01\n2  Mary Lou 2:56 \n3  Shu ba da du ma ma ma  5:40 \n4 Your Cash Ain't Nothin' But Trash 3:21 \n5 The Joker 4:25\n6 Lovin' Cup  2:10 \n7 Come on in My Kitchen  4:05 \n8 Evil  4:32 \n9 Something to Believe In  4:42\n\nRecording information: Aquarius Theatre, Boston, MA; Capitol Recording Studios, Hollywood, CA; Capitol Records; Tower Theatre Philly.\n\nSteve Miller Band: [/b][/color]Steve Miller (vocals, guitar, harmonica); Dickie Thompson (Clavinet, organ); Gerald Johnson (bass); John King (drums).\n\nAdditional personnel:\n\nSneaky Pete Kleinow (pedal steel guitar); Lonnie Turner (bass).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96bca8ab31831d9b0a3a605d5a633464369ee6b","amp;dn":"Steve+Miller+Band++The+Joker%28rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96bca8ab31831d9b0a3a605d5a633464369ee6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,107,202,138,179,24,49,217,176,163,166,5,213,166,51,70,67,105,238,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
