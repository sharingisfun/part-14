This desire for instant gratification has become ingrained into\nour culture.\n\nAnd now you've got 40 seconds to decide whether to pay for a download from an\nonline music store. But what about music that you might not get in that time?\nDoes it mean we're all doomed to remain in our comfort zones, never to be\ntroubled with new or unusual sounds?\n\nFor some, perhaps, that may be the case, but thankfully there are people who\nwant new experiences, and Dhafer Youssef's music is a good place to start. A\nTunisian-born singer who's been living and working in Europe since 1990, Youssef\nopens his soul and projects a thousand aching meanings inspired by the wisdom\nand spiritualism of the centuries-old Sufic tradition, resulting in music of\nsuch timeless beauty you can imagine it happening at any point over the last\nthousand years. It's the sound of humanity that resonates within us all, a\nuniversality that stirs something deep within that we never knew was there. And\nwhat Youssef does is imbue this sound with contemporary relevance by seizing the\nliberating potential of technology.\n\nComplemented by four ultra-hip Norwegian nu jazz musicians (Eivind Aarset, Arve\nHenriksen, Rune Arnesen, Audun Erlien), his ancient praise singing is played out\nagainst a new sonic backdrop coloured by fragments of electronic sounds, rhythms\nand samples, all of which ripple through the music. The result is what every\nartist wants to do (but very few indeed succeed in doing) - to create music of\nthe past, the present and the future.\n\nProduced by post-Hendrix guitar wizard Aarset, whose incredible\nelectronica-inspired textures perfectly frame Youssef's voice and oud playing\n(the Arabic lute), this highly personal world is perfectly complemented by the\nplaying and singing of trumpeter Henriksen. One of Norway's most creative and\ncompelling musicians, his trumpet can sound like a pan flute one minute, the\nnext a Vindaloo-inspired fart; while his wordless vocals are sometimes used to\necho Youssef's own and range from a dreamy tenor to an incredible falsetto that\nwould give any castrato a run for his money.\n\nAdd contributions from the Oslo Session String Quartet - who bolster melody\nlines and add gorgeous, ambient-sounding harmonies - and Youssef's fourth album,\nfrom the opening 'Cantus Lamentus' through the 11/4 groove of 'Eleventh Stone'\nto the haunting 'Postludium', is one that may not provide a quick fix but will\nsupply lasting beauty.\n\nNo prizes for guessing which I'd prefer.\n\n-- \nEn castellano:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99d0a5bab29efbcdd9dfd91fa5932584d34b22d2","amp;dn":"Dhafer+Youssef+-+Divine+Shadows+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99d0a5bab29efbcdd9dfd91fa5932584d34b22d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,208,165,186,178,158,251,205,217,223,217,31,165,147,37,132,211,75,34,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
