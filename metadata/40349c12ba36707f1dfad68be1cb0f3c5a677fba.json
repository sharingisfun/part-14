Amplifiers may look dull to the rest of the world, but to guitarists they are full of mystique, romance, and rockin' sound. And while there are many strong-selling electric guitar histories available, here's the first illustrated history of the electric guitarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend, the amp. World-famous guitar and amp historian Dave Hunter tells the story of 60 of the greatest amps ever built, including classics from Fender, Marshall, Vox, the bizarre EchoSonic that created Elvis' sound, and the ultimate esoteric $75,000+ Dumble amps. The story is illustrated with hundreds of technical photos, rare machines, catalogs, memorabilia, and the amps of the stars, from Jimi Hendrix to Stevie Ray Vaughan to Eric Clapton. This is a book guitarists will drool over.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40349c12ba36707f1dfad68be1cb0f3c5a677fba","amp;dn":"Amped+-+The+Illustrated+History+of+the+World%27s+Greatest+Amplifie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40349c12ba36707f1dfad68be1cb0f3c5a677fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,52,156,18,186,54,112,127,29,250,214,139,225,203,15,60,90,103,127,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
