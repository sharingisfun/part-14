Led by frontman Patterson Hood and featuring a rotating cast of Georgia and Alabama natives, the band celebrated the South while refusing to paint over its spotty past. History, folklore, politics, and character studies all shared equal space in the Truckers catalog, which offered up its first blast of gutsy, twangy rock with 1998's Gangstabilly. However, it was the band's ambitious double-disc concept album, The Southern Rock Opera, that became its unlikely magnum opus. A two-act affair, the album explored Hood's fascination with '70s Southern rock (specifically Lynyrd Skynyrd) while tackling the cultural contradictions of the region, and it helped lay the groundwork for much of the band's later work. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tATO\nCatalog:\t\tATO 0226CD\nContains:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue, Log\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n01.Shit Shots Count\n02.When He's Gone\n03.Primer Coat\n04.Pauline Hawkins\n05.Made Up English Oceans\n06.The Part Of Him\n07.Hearing Jimmy Loud\n08.Til He's Dead Or Rises\n09.Hanging On\n10.Natural Light\n11.When Walter Went Crazy\n12.First Air Of Autumn\n13.Grand Canyon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77e76dd70a9e8e207943b77801b6029e8b715c99","amp;dn":"Drive-By+Truckers+-+English+Oceans+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77e76dd70a9e8e207943b77801b6029e8b715c99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,231,109,215,10,158,142,32,121,67,183,120,1,182,2,158,139,113,92,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
