It is a cube-shaped device made up of smaller cube pieces with six faces having differing colors. The primary method of manufacture involves injection molding of the various component pieces, then subsequent assembly, labeling, and packaging. The cube was extremely popular during the 1980s, and at its peak between 1980 and 1983, 200 million cubes were sold world wide. Today sales continue to be over 500,000 cubes sold world wide each year.\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Notes-Rubiks-Magic-David-Singmaster/dp/0894900439","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af7ca44902861712acf8c0f4375c3e8bec4466a8","amp;dn":"Notes+on+Rubik%27s+Magic+Cube+by+David+Singmaster+Santhan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af7ca44902861712acf8c0f4375c3e8bec4466a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,124,164,73,2,134,23,18,172,248,192,244,55,92,62,139,236,68,102,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
