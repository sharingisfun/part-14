The series is told in the third person by point of view (POV) characters, whose number reaches 31 by the fifth novel. Three stories become interwoven: the chronicling of a dynastic war for control of Westeros by several families; the rising threat of the dormant cold supernatural Others dwelling beyond an immense wall of ice on Westeros' northern border; and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the exiled daughter of a king murdered in a civil war shortly before her birth, to return to Westeros with her fire-breathing dragons and claim her rightful throne.\n\nContent:\n\n1 A Game of Thrones\n2 A Clash of Kings\n3 A Storm of Swords\n4 A Feast for Crows\n5 A Dance With Dragons","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1314f150fd4008318e7c28d861cfb418f12760f","amp;dn":"A+Song+of+Ice+and+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1314f150fd4008318e7c28d861cfb418f12760f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,49,79,21,15,212,0,131,24,231,194,141,134,28,251,65,143,18,118,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
