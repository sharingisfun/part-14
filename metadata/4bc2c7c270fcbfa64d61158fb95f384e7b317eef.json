Records. Produced by Mitch Easter and Don Dixon, the album was recorded at Reflection Sound Studio in Charlotte, North Carolina over 16 days in December 1983 and January 1984. Dixon and Easter intended to capture the sound of R.E.M.'s live performances, and used binaural recording on several tracks. Singer Michael Stipe dealt with darker subject matter in his lyrics, and water imagery is a recurring theme on the record. Released to critical acclaim, Reckoning reached number 27 in the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â€where it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1991, and peaked at number 91 in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile many of the album's songs were new compositions, some had been in R.E.M.'s show setlists for years. In particular, &quot;Pretty Persuasion&quot; and &quot;(Don't Go Back to) Rockville&quot; had been played live as far back as October 1980. The band was reluctant to record &quot;Pretty Persuasion&quot; as the members considered it too old, but Dixon and Easter convinced the group to do so.\n\n\nR.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and drummer Bill Berry. One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. gained early attention because of Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style and Stipe's unclear vocals. R.E.M. released its first single, &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot;, in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single &quot;The One I Love&quot;. The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nR.E.M.'s early breakthrough success served as an inspiration for other alternative bands. Spin referred to the &quot;R.E.M. model&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€career decisions that R.E.M. made which set guidelines for other underground artists to follow in their own careers. Spin's Charles Aaron wrote that by 1985, &quot;They'd shown how far an underground, punk-inspired rock band could go within the industry without whoring out its artistic integrity in any obvious way. They'd figured out how to buy in, not sellout-in other words, they'd achieved the American Bohemian Dream.&quot; Steve Wynn of Dream Syndicate said, &quot;They invented a whole new ballgame for all of the other bands to follow whether it was Sonic Youth or the Replacements or Nirvana or Butthole Surfers. R.E.M. staked the claim. Musically, the bands did different things, but R.E.M. was first to show us you can be big and still be cool.&quot; Biographer David Buckley stated that between 1991 and 1994, a period that saw the band sell an estimated 30 million albums, R.E.M. &quot;asserted themselves as rivals to U2 for the title of biggest rock band in the world.&quot; Over the course of its career, the band has sold over 70 million records.\n\nLater alternative bands such as Nirvana, Pavement, and Live, have drawn inspiration from R.E.M.'s music. &quot;When I was 15 years old in Richmond, Virginia, they were a very important part of my life,&quot; Pavement's Bob Nastanovich said, &quot;as they were for all the members of our band.&quot; Pavement devoted the song &quot;Unseen Power of the Picket Fence&quot; from the No Alternative compilation (1993) to discussing Chronic Town and Reckoning. Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was a vocal fan of R.E.M., and had plans to collaborate on a musical project with Stipe before his death in April 1994. Cobain told Rolling Stone in an interview earlier that year, &quot;I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how that band does what they do. God, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the greatest. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music.&quot;\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckoning_(R.E.M._album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckoning_(R.E.M._album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CaamKAagd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CaamKAagd&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:27\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
