On day two, they're given geoduck, which must be the main ingredient in all menu items. After selling $200 with their geoduck menus, they race to a local lumber mill, for a chance to win a reward, which might be enough to save them from this week's elimination.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 25-Aug-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e446b631c1f7863c9f876ab3e094d3c7730c30d8","amp;dn":"The.Great.Food.Truck.Race.S04E02.WS.DSR.x264-NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e446b631c1f7863c9f876ab3e094d3c7730c30d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,70,182,49,193,247,134,60,159,135,106,179,224,148,211,199,115,12,48,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
