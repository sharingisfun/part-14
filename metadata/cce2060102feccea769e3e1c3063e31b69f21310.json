I prefer and love Photoshop but hate the mess it leaves behind. i've also tried other portable versions of Photoshop and they're usually decrepit, slow as hell, virtualized, unreliable, leave shit behind, or untrustworthy. This version has been designed with PortableApps.com's Launcher which allows Photoshop to see and use your computer's CPU, GPU, RAM, and Disks unleashing Photoshop's true potential. In addition, i've implemented as many features as possible. ie. CameraRaw, Extensions, Presets, video editing, etc. I use this as my de-facto all-purpose image editor.. it's fast, lite, responsive, and with just enough features.\n\nDependencies: Administrative Privileges\n\nMinimal Requirements: Windows Vista\n\nLanguages: Arabic, SimpChinese, TradChinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, EnglishGB, Finnish, French, FrenchCA, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Moroccan, Norwegian, Polish, PortugueseBR, Russian, Spanish, SpanishInternational, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian. \n\nHow to Install: extract to desired location, launch PhotoshopPortable.exe or Photoshop64Portable.exe\n\nFiles:\nPhotoshopPortable_15.2.2.paf.exe | CRC: AE8C5FE8 | Size: 307 mb - 1.2 gb | 1.3 gb\nPhotoshop64Portable_15.2.2.paf.exe | CRC: DD192B0A | Size: 328 mb - 1.3 gb | 1.4 gb\n\nNotes:\n- Video Editing is only compatible with Windows x64\n- Dictionaries, Camera Profiles, and Lens Profiles are not included but can be downloaded from my blog: PortableWares","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cce2060102feccea769e3e1c3063e31b69f21310","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+CC+2014.2.2+Portable+-+PAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cce2060102feccea769e3e1c3063e31b69f21310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,226,6,1,2,254,204,234,118,158,62,28,48,99,227,27,105,242,19,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
