Reports suggested that Huey Lewis had objected to the context in which his song was used in the film and demanded it be removed from the CD.\n\nIn reality, there was no objection over the context. Although the film's production team had paid for the rights to use the song in the film, the rights to include it on the soundtrack were overlooked. When the soundtrack was released with the song on it, Huey Lewis had it withdrawn, as the soundtrack rights had not been secured.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho_%28film%29#Soundtrack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho_%28film%29#Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/soundtrack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/American-Psycho-Controversial-Motion-Picture/dp/B00004T0L1/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1286631142&amp;sr=8-1-spell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/American-Psycho-Controversial-Motion-Picture/dp/B00004T0L1/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1286631142&amp;sr=8-1-spell&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll the material for this compilation was obtained via TPB.
