Through practical examples, he illuminates the challenges involved in writing applications that fully utilize multicore processors, helping you produce applications that are functionally correct, offer superior performance, and scale well to eight cores, sixteen cores, and beyond.\n\nThe book reveals how specific hardware implementations impact application performance and shows how to avoid common pitfalls. Step by step, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll write applications that can handle large numbers of parallel threads, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll master advanced parallelization techniques. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to\n\n* Identify your best opportunities to use parallelism\n* Share data safely between multiple threads\n* Write applications using POSIX or Windows threads\n* Hand-code synchronization and sharing\n* Take advantage of automatic parallelization and OpenMP\n* Overcome common obstacles to scaling\n* Apply new approaches to writing correct, fast, scalable parallel code\n\nMulticore Application Programming isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wedded to a single approach or platform: It is for every experienced C programmer working with any contemporary multicore processor in any leading operating system environment.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nDarryl Gove is a senior principal software engineer in the Oracle Solaris Studio compiler team. He works on the analysis, parallelization, and optimization of both applications and benchmarks. Darryl has a masterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s degree and a doctorate in operational research from the University of Southampton, UK. He is the author of the books Solaris Application Programming (Prentice Hall, 2008) and The DeveloperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Edge (Sun Microsystems, 2009). He writes regularly about optimization and coding and maintains a blog at www.darrylgove.com.\n\nBook Details\n Paperback: 480 pages\n Publisher: Addison-Wesley Professional; 1 edition (October, 2010)\n Language: English\n ISBN-10: 0321711378\n ISBN-13: 978-0321711373\n File Size: 6.2 MiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32fd4337f75dfefdd9d51c26217efea576eb9525","amp;dn":"Addison.Wesley.Multicore.Application.Programming.Oct.2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32fd4337f75dfefdd9d51c26217efea576eb9525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,253,67,55,247,93,254,253,217,213,28,38,33,126,254,165,118,235,149,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
