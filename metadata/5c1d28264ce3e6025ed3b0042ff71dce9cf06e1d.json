Cooper, the Olmec civilization, Jeff      \n Tremaine's waistline, even the whole continent of       \n Atlantis. Most important and culturally relevant,       \n though, is a big mess of jackass segments that had      \n apparently slipped through a crack in Mianus and never  \n found a home on any of the DVD releases for the classic \n MTV television series. The &quot;Self Defense Test,&quot; &quot;Stun   \n Collar,&quot; &quot;Unicycle Poo Barf,&quot; &quot;Fast Food Football,&quot;     \n &quot;Roller Jump,&quot; and &quot;Satan vs. God&quot; (in its original     \n long ass-kicking form!) are just some of the absurd     \n gold that what was once lost but now is found, not to   \n mention all the original show opens, credit montages,   \n and a bunch of other bonus footage that was never shown \n on television -- or wasn't allowed to be shown --       \n featuring Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris \n Pontius, Ryan Dunn, Preston Lacy, Wee-Man, Danger       \n Ehren, and Dave England in their earliest years of      \n basic cable fame and notoriety.                         \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n          Johnny Knoxville ...

Normally we don't like to lower      \n  ourselves to the point of mentioning p2p groups, but we      \n  thought we should atleast mention the other release of this  \n  movie, if you want to call it that. There was a release      \n  already done by some crappy p2p group, but it had countless  \n  things wrong with it. If each of the individual problems     \n  had a measureable amount of mass, their combined size would  \n  total just over 3.64 metric fucktons. There was bad AR, bad  \n  framerate and on and on. And it was supposed to be a proper  \n  of another rip! Seriously though, there wasn't a single      \n  correct thing with that rip. You almost have to try in       \n  order to fuck shit up that bad.                              \n                                                               \n  The only catch with this rip is that it had to be ripped at  \n  the full 29.97fps since there was constant ghosting due to   \n  the filming methods used. We ran into this problem back in   \n  2002 with the original Jackass movie we ripped.              \n                                                               \n  Anyways... we hope you enjoy the REAL rip of this movie.     \n                                                               \n  Happy Turkey Day!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c1d28264ce3e6025ed3b0042ff71dce9cf06e1d","amp;dn":"Jackass.The.Lost.Tapes.2009.DVDRip.XviD-VH-PROD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c1d28264ce3e6025ed3b0042ff71dce9cf06e1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,29,40,38,76,227,230,2,94,211,176,4,47,247,29,206,156,240,110,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
