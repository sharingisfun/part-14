You Win Some, You Tie Some\n14. Armageddonsong\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sort of fun to try to pinpoint exactly where Daniel KnoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs go off the rails, running like a railway car over well-trodden, pre-war music hall tracks until they suddenly leap for the canyons. These 14 songs vary in style, from Salvation Army band oompah marches to slinky rhumbas to Dixieland struts to piano balladry of a sort that went out with Brylcreem. Yet theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all, to one degree or another, deeply weird and subversive, a kind of sentimental journey without the sentimentality.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5165e1b1c256202b01f373496350614e0c43c185","amp;dn":"Daniel+Knox...Evryman+for+Himself%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5165e1b1c256202b01f373496350614e0c43c185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,101,225,177,194,86,32,43,1,243,115,73,99,80,97,78,12,67,193,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
