Director Raoul Walsh presents all that you look for in a western. An outlaw(Joel McCrea)has two things on his mind after getting out of jail. One is another railroad heist and the second is romancing &quot;bad&quot; girl Virginia Mayo. Fast moving action with great images of Colorado Territory. Super supporting cast includes: Dorothy Malone, James Mitchell, Henry Hull and John Archer. One of the best of the genre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6136fe9d70722eb53b56aa3ae51daf5be90f38db","amp;dn":"Colorado+Territory+%281949%29+94+min.Joel+McCrea%2CVirginia+Mayo.Weste","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6136fe9d70722eb53b56aa3ae51daf5be90f38db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,54,254,157,112,114,46,181,59,86,170,58,229,29,175,91,233,15,56,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
