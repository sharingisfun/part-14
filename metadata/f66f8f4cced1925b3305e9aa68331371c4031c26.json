Premiered in America the film is pilloried by ultra-right religious groups for its depiction of Christ. In England the Popular Peoples' Church of St Sophia (whose members include a Tourettes sufferer who shouts out swear words) find a copy of the script in a dustbin and lobby the British censor for its suppression,leading to many local councils banning its screening. Death threats follow and Michael Palin - &quot;the nicest man in Britain&quot; - has his effigy burned on his front lawn. Finally crazed TV programmer Alan Dick persuades Palin and co-star John Cleese to defend the picture on a late night chat show against the Bishop of Southwark and religious commentator Malcolm Muggeridge. Thanks to Cleese's reasoning the Pythons are seen to triumph,winning over the Popular Peoples' Church.\n\n\nname..........:Holy.Flying.Circus.2011.DVDRiP.XviD-UNVEiL\nrls...........:12/02/2012\nrtl...........:02/2012\n\nurl...........:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981637\n\n\non with rls info\n\nfilesize......:699 MiB\ncodec.........:XviD\nduration......:1h 29mn\nvideo.........:943 Kbps\nres...........:640x320 px\nar............:2.000\nfps...........:25.000 fps\naudio.........:english MP3 144 Kbps VBR\n\n[img]http://img848.imageshack.us/img848/4949/vlcsnap2012021201h42m03.png[/img]\n[img]http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/5493/vlcsnap2012021201h42m08.png[/img]\n[img]http://img864.imageshack.us/img864/9956/vlcsnap2012021201h42m27.png[/img]\n[img]http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/4753/vlcsnap2012021201h42m17.png[/img][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f66f8f4cced1925b3305e9aa68331371c4031c26","amp;dn":"Holy.Flying.Circus.2011.DVDRiP.XviD-+UNVEiL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f66f8f4cced1925b3305e9aa68331371c4031c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,111,143,76,206,209,146,91,51,5,233,170,104,51,19,113,196,3,28,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
