Changes over these versions undocumented and almost innumerable.\n\n1.4.0.5 to 2.0: Written in C#, changes are drastic and innumerable.\n\n2.0.1: \n-Added ID to INI file. This is to prevent using an old INI with newer version that would result in a crash.\n-Added Daily Tasks for AutoKMS and AutoRearm\n-AutoKMS can now KMS activate Windows\n-AutoRearm can now convert Retail to VL automatically to eliminate nags\n-Automatically Delete KMS Keygen and Hostname are now disabled by default.\n-Better error recovery and notification.\n-Fixed false success in EZ-Activator if KMS Keygen got deleted by AV.\n-Removed Tokens Only Restore - It just doesn't work and nobody uses it as the Full Restore is always needed.\n-Starting KMS Keygen is now the first thing done during activation so if AV causes failure we don't waste time.\n-Using Modded KMS Emulator (By Phazor) to lessen amount of AV false positives.\n\nOffice 2010 Toolkit Information: \nThis is a set of tools and functions for managing licensing and activating Office 2010. All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as this could conflict or damage Office 2010. The Channel Switcher, AutoKMS Uninstaller, AutoRearm Uninstaller, Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Office 2010 is not installed. For information about individual functions, read further below.\n\nOffice 2010 Toolkit Functions:\nMain Tab:\nEZ-Activator: This is a universal and simple activator for Office 2010. It can use KMS activation even if you are using Retail License. EZ-Activator gathers information about your Office 2010 licensing status to provide the best method of activation. It can automatically attempt possible fixes in case of activation failure, and can reverse all changes in case of total failure.\n\nOffice 2010 Information: This states if Office 2010 is installed on your PC and whether it is 32 bit (x86), 64 bit (x64) or 32 bit running on 64 bit OS (x86-64).\n\nOffice Uninstaller: Run a script that will uninstall and cleanly remove Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office 2003 and later is supported.\n\nActivation Tab:\nOffice 2010 AutoKMS: AutoKMS is a scheduled task that will renew your 180 day KMS activation. Unlike other KMS activators, AutoKMS does not run 24/7 or only at the last minute with the hope it won't fail, and leaves no traces of itself other than a scheduled task and exe file. It only attempts to activate KMS licenses (which saves a lot of time if you have non-KMS licenses such as MAK or Retail active). It will run at startup and then every 24 hours and attempt KMS activation a set amount of times. The Install/Uninstall buttons are used to install or remove AutoKMS. \n\nOffice 2010 AutoRearm: AutoRearm is a scheduled task that will allow you to use Office 2010 in grace period forever. It requires that you have at least 1 available rearm upon install. It works by taking a backup of your activation and restoring it when you run out of rearms. It runs on startup and then every 24 hours, and checks how many days left you have on your grace period. It will rearm if you have 5 or fewer days before your grace period expires. If the rearm fails because the count ran out (which is normal and inevitable), it restores the backup, which puts the count where it was upon install of AutoRearm. Because this grace period is likely expired, it then rearms (which is why at least 1 rearm is required). The backup will be restored upon uninstall. \nNOTE: Retail Office 2010 nags you for activation on startup. You can stop this by converting to VL and using KMS Product Key, which is done automatically by default.\n\nAttempt Office 2010 Activation: This will attempt to activate any and all Office 2010 products. \n\nCheck Office 2010 Activation Status: This will display detailed information on Office 2010 activation including how many days you are licensed for, what Product Key and type of license you are using, and much more.\n\nRearm Office 2010: This resets the 30 day grace period that all Office 2010 products have. Rearm can be done up to 5 times. The available button will tell you how many rearms you have available.\n\nLicense Files Tab:\nAdd License: This will add the ability to use a Product Key for a certain Office 2010 product. You do not even need that Office 2010 product installed. \nIt will install a provided Product Key if available; else you will have to install your own product key with Key Manager after License Add succeeds. All the provided Retail Product Keys are trials or blacklisted but can be rearmed for temporary use. The provided VL Product Keys are KMS Product Keys.\nEX: This can be used to use Professional Plus License on Standard. \n\nThis also lets you convert from Retail to VL. Set License Type to Volume and select the Office 2010 product that you want to convert to VL, then press Add. Vice Versa applies if you wish to convert VL to Retail.\nNOTE: There are no VL versions of Home and Business, Home and Student, and Professional so convert them to Professional Plus.\n\nDelete All: This deletes all licensing information for Office 2010. This is meant to be used if your license details are corrupted or marked as tampered. This will force Office 2010 to repair itself and it will be in either Notifications Mode (VL) or Reduced-Functionality Mode (Retail).  You will probably not be able to rearm to get out. You will have to activate which may fail with KMS Keygen. This is a last resort and should be used sparingly unless using EZ-Activator. \nNOTE: When Office 2010 repairs itself, it restores licenses for what you have physically installed; any Licenses added/converted using License Add or EZ-Activator will not be restored.\n\nProduct Keys Tab:\nInstall: This will install an Office 2010 Product Key, using either a provided Product Key based upon your selection or a custom Product Key that you enter. A Product Key cannot be installed unless you have that Office 2010 License installed.\n\nUninstall: This will remove an Office 2010 Product Key, either removing the Product Key based upon your selection or a custom Product Key that you enter. \n\nCheck: This will give information on an Office 2010 Product Key, using either a provided Product Key based upon your selection or a custom Product Key that you enter. This information is what you would get from a PIDX checker.\n\nLicense Backup Tab:\nBackup: This saves your Office 2010 licensing information so it can be restored later. This information is machine and install specific, so it usually won't work after a reformat and definitely won't work on different hardware. It saves the current state but does not stop the clock, so a 25 day old backup restored will be whatever days you had minus 25 when you took the backup. Backups are stored in subdirectories in a &quot;Backups&quot; folder that will be created in the same directory as the Office 2010 Toolkit executable using the name you entered.\n\nRestore: Restores all of the information saved in a previous backup. It will take a temporary backup of your current state, delete your current state, and then restore the backup. If it fails to restore it will try to restore the temporary backup.\n\nCustomize Setup Tab (Coming Soon/WIP/Subject to change):\nBrowse: Opens window so you can select the setup.exe for your office installer. You must have previously extracted the Office 2010 Installer somewhere (ISO files and self-extracting exe files not supported, you must extract yourself). If the installer is both 32 and 64 bit (has a setup.exe and x86 and x64 folders), browse inside one of those folders for setup.exe, convert that, then repeat for the other folder.\n\nConvert: The product determined by your selection in the combo boxes will have its licensing channel changed. If the product is Retail, it will become VL. If the product is VL, it will become Retail. Press Convert for each selection that you want to change the licensing channel for.\n\nIntegrate Language: Browse to a language pack for Office 2010 and integrate it into the Office 2010 installer. When you run Office 2010 setup, you will be able to use this language if more than one language is in the Office 2010 installer; otherwise the only language in the installer is used.\n\nRemove Language: If multiple languages are in the Office 2010 installer, you can choose one to remove. You cannot remove a language if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the only one in the Office 2010 installer.\n\nOffice 2010 Toolkit Settings:\nGlobal Tab:\nKMS Server To Use: Allows you to set what KMS server should be used when attempting KMS activation. Unless you have a real KMS server or a network host running the KMS emulator you will want this set to 127.0.0.1.\n\nUse KMS Keygen/Emulator: Uses KMS emulator to perform KMS activation. Unless you have a real KMS server or a network host running the KMS emulator you will want this enabled.\n\nDelete KMS Keygen After Run: Removes the KMS emulator from your PC after KMS activation.\n\nDelete KMS Host After Run: Removes the KMS server from the registry after KMS activation.\n\nAuto-Repair Office After License Delete: After running License Delete All, automatically repair Office afterwards so you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to open Office and go through all the error dialogs and repair progress windows. Chances of successful activation right after this are higher than manually repairing Office.\n\nAutoKMS Tab:\nNumber Of Activation Attempts Per Product: How many times activation should be tried before giving up for that product. 10 to 25 attempts are recommended.\n\nKMS Server To Use: Allows you to set what KMS server should be used when attempting KMS activation. Unless you have a real KMS server or a network host running the KMS emulator you will want this set to 127.0.0.1.\n\nLogging: Saves the results of AutoKMS to a log file so you can see if activation was successful, if it failed, and why.\n\nUse KMS Keygen/Emulator: Uses KMS emulator to perform KMS activation. Unless you have a real KMS server or a network host running the KMS emulator you will want this enabled.\n\nDelete KMS Keygen After Run: Removes the KMS emulator from your PC after KMS activation.\n\nDelete KMS Host After Run: Removes the KMS server from the registry after KMS activation.\n\nActivate Windows: Attempt to activate Windows. Only use if you have KMS key installed.\n\nAutoRearm Tab:\nConvert Retail To VL: Runs the converter from EZ-Activator so that you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get the Retail nags every start of Office.\n\nEZ-Activator Tab:\nNumber Of Activation Attempts Per Product: How many times activation should be tried before giving up for that product. 10 to 25 attempts are recommended.\n\nInstall AutoKMS: If EZ-Activator succeeds it will install AutoKMS.\n\nConvert Unactivated Retail To KMS: If using Retail License and it is not permanently activated, convert it to VL and install KMS Product Key.\n\nConvert Unactivated Retail To KMS: If using VL MAK License and it is not permanently activated, install KMS Product Key.\n\nPermanently Activate Starter: If you are using Office 2010 Starter with subscription License, install Product Key that results in instant and permanent activation for Starter. I have never seen a subscription Starter Office 2010 as itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s supposed to be a free advertising supported product so you can probably disable this to make EZ-Activator skip this and save a few seconds of time.\n\nUninstall Unactivated Keys: If EZ-Activator converts an Unactivated Retail License to VL, uninstall the Retail key so Office 2010 does not use both Retail and VL Product Key. \n\nRearm On Failure: If EZ-Activator fails, attempt to rearm. If rearm succeeds, try activating again.\n\nReinstall Licenses On Failure: Run the License Add for all Office 2010 licenses currently installed then try activating again.\n\nDelete Licenses On Failure: Run License Delete All, then automatically repair Office 2010 licensing (not affected by the Auto-Repair on License Delete setting, so this will always repair automatically). After repairing, attempt activation again. This is what usually fixes the activation error so I strongly encourage leaving this enabled.\n\nTake Backup In Case Of Failure: Create a temporary backup, and restore it if EZ-Activator totally fails to activate. This effectively reverses all changes EZ-Activator made.\n\nRequirements:\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 3.5 (It is built into Vista/7 so only XP users need to install this).\nOffice 2010 should be installed as most of the toolkit functions are obviously useless without Office 2010 installed.\n\nScreenshots:\n\n\nCredits:\nCredits - Developers:\nCODYQX4\nBosh\n\nCredits - Other:\nletsgoawayhell for how to install and obtain Office 2010 license files needed for License Add/Convert.\nZWT for the KMS Keygen.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nScanned with kaspersky internet security 2011, no threat detected...\nPlease seed and write comments...\nHow to seed:-\nJust leave your torrent client{Like utorrent} for 1 hour after download, it is called seeding, it will help in making this torrent alive...\nThanks...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e52a69b3746951c0ed59aa22c9803c2bacb8b18d","amp;dn":"Ms+office+Ez+activator+2.0.1+for+office+2010+%5BEagerforcc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e52a69b3746951c0ed59aa22c9803c2bacb8b18d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,42,105,179,116,105,81,192,237,89,170,34,201,128,60,43,172,184,177,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
