It was released on a budget label. It was noticeable for the fact that many tracks are missing, including some of Cathy's biggest sellers: &quot;C'mon and Get My Love&quot; (with D Mob). - &quot;That's the Way of the World&quot; (with D Mob) - &quot;Why&quot; (with D Mob) \nAlbum songs where included to make up for the lack of songs, mainly from Cathy's last album. The album also contained album version of tracks as opposed to the single remixes. Because of the lack of a complete singles collection, and the fact that album contained no unreleased tracks from her unreleased album &quot;Inspiration&quot; or any of the rare Japanese tracks, many fans saw the album as cash in. The album appeared online to download in 2007.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Touch Me (All Night Long)\n[02] My Beating Heart\n[03] Just Another Dream\n[04] Too Many Walls\n[05] Everybody Move (Single Version)\n[06] You Lied To Me\n[07] Irresistible\n[08] Being With You\n[09] Falling\n[10] Change Will Come\n[11] West End Pad\n[12] Am I The Kinda Girl\n[13] When Dreams Turn To Dust (Single Version)\n[14] The Date\n[15] Fickle\n[16] That Is Why You Love Me\n[17] Waterloo Sunset\n[18] Tell Me\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 01h:10m:55s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 171mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 17 July 2000\nRecord Company\t&gt; Spectrum Music Universal Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Dennis\n&gt;&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/cathydennis\n&gt;[Irresistible]\n&gt;[Just Another Dream]\n&gt;[Touch Me {All Night Long]\n \n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2fdbe94f290741237797af181aaaa5578e3e3ab","amp;dn":"%5B2000%5D+The+Irresistible+-+Cathy+Dennis+171mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2fdbe94f290741237797af181aaaa5578e3e3ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,253,190,148,242,144,116,18,55,121,122,241,129,170,170,85,120,227,227,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
