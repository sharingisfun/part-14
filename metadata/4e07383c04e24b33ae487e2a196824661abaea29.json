The terrain is rugged and covered in dense forest canopy, making &amp;#039;line of sight&amp;#039; tactics a real part of the game play. The forest is penetrated by roads, rivers and electricity pylons creating a landscape ideally suited to low-level helicopter combat.\nApache Havoc features in excess of 50 different vehicles. \n\nInstall instructions and patch included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e07383c04e24b33ae487e2a196824661abaea29","amp;dn":"Apache+Havoc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e07383c04e24b33ae487e2a196824661abaea29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,7,56,60,4,226,75,51,174,72,126,42,25,104,36,102,26,186,234,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
