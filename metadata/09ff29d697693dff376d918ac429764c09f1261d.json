Flightradar 24 has a rapidly growing network of several thousand ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions Flightradar24, with the help of multilateration, is able to calculate the positions of aircraft that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have ADS-B transponders.\n\nTraditional radar data is also used in the app thanks to a direct feed from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This data provides near real-time coverage of all US and Canadian airspace.\n\n***IMPORTANT NOTICE - COVERAGE***\nIf you are only interested in tracking air traffic in a specific region, we suggest that you check Flightradar24.com BEFORE purchasing the app. Flightradar24 provides unrivaled positional aircraft data coverage around the world but there are areas where we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have coverage. \n\nOverview of coverage as of November 2013:\n* Europe: close to 100%\n* North America: 100% of US and Canada via slightly delayed radar data. Real-time coverage for most of US, Canada and Mexico for ADS-B equipped aircraft\n* South America: Substantial coverage in most countries including Brazil, Argentina and Chile\n* Asia: Substantial coverage in most major Asian countries including Japan, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, UAE, Malaysia, Taiwan and many other countries. Rapidly expanding coverage in China \n* Oceania: Nearly complete coverage in Australia and New Zealand\n* Africa: Substantial coverage in South Africa. Limited but growing coverage in the rest of the region\n\nCoverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for the latest on Flightradar24.\n\nHELP &amp; SUPPORT\nforum.flightradar24.com/threads/89-Important-Read-this-before-you-ask-questions\nflightradar24.com/contact-us.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.
