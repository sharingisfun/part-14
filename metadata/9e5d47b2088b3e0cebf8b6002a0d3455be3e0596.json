Pervin\nWiley | January 2013 | ISBN-10: 1118360052 | PDF | 640 pages | 19.1 mb\n\nNow in a new edition, this book expands on previous editions on the study of personality and neuroscience. \nIt draws on research on the biological foundations of personality and trait-based research including investigations of neural mechanisms in defensive information processing as well as brain systems critical to self-concept. The text introduces questions of personality-and-brain along with biological foundations. It explores each of various theoretical issues at a new level of investigation, that of brain research to provide a more up-to-date look at the field.\n\nCONTENTS\nPREFACE  v\nCHAPTER 1 - PERSONALITY THEORY: FROM EVERYDAY OBSERVATIONS TO SYSTEMATIC THEORIES, 1\nCHAPTER 2 - THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF PEOPLE, 33\nCHAPTER 3 - A PSYCHODYNAMIC THEORY: FREUDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY OF PERSONALITY, 69\nCHAPTER 4 - FREUDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY: APPLICATIONS, RELATED THEORETICAL CONCEPTIONS, AND CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH, 113\nCHAPTER 5 - A PHENOMENOLOGICAL THEORY: CARL ROGERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PERSON-CENTERED THEORY OF PERSONALITY, 163\nCHAPTER 6 - ROGERSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PHENOMENOLOGICAL THEORY: APPLICATIONS, RELATED THEORETICAL CONCEPTIONS, AND CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH, 191\nCHAPTER 7 - TRAIT THEORIES OF PERSONALITY: ALLPORT, EYSENCK, AND CATTELL, 229\nCHAPTER 8 - TRAIT THEORY: THE FIVE-FACTOR MODEL; APPLICATIONS AND EVALUATION OF TRAIT APPROACHES TO PERSONALITY, 261\nCHAPTER 9 - BIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF PERSONALITY, 301\nCHAPTER 10 - BEHAVIORISM AND THE LEARNING APPROACHES TO PERSONALITY, 351\nCHAPTER 11 - A COGNITIVE THEORY: GEORGE A.
