The stock market plummets, hyperinflation cripples commerce and the mounting crisis passes the tipping point. Practically overnight, the fragile chains of supply and high-technology infrastructure fall, and wholesale rioting and looting grip every major city\n\nAs hordes of refugees and looters pour out of the cities, a small group of friends living in the Midwest desperately tries to make their way to a safe-haven ranch in northern Idaho. The journey requires all their skill and training since communication, commerce, transportation and law enforcement have all disappeared. Once at the ranch, the group fends off vicious attacks from outsiders and then looks to join other groups that are trying to restore true Constitutional law to the country. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64f33e72765a70e8f65be9840decae9627bddc3b","amp;dn":"Patriots%3A+Surviving+the+Coming+Collapse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64f33e72765a70e8f65be9840decae9627bddc3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,243,62,114,118,90,112,232,246,91,233,132,13,236,174,150,39,189,220,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
