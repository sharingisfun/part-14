Like Hellville, Dead End consists of Ott's trademark storytelling - wordless, stark, black-and-white scratchboard horror stories with twist endings, rendered beautifully with fish eye perspectives that create a vertiginous anxiety. Parts Twilight Zone, O Henry, and Kafka, Ott's work evokes a visual history of literary suspense and horror - it reads like Dante's Inferno done as an issue of Tales from the Crypt, drawn by original Inferno illustrator Gustave DorÃƒÂ©.\n\nThe two stories In Dead End focus literally and figuratively on the circle. In the first short story, entitled 'The Millionaires', a mysterious suitcase of money creates a cycle of death spurred by greed and lust; yes, another contemporary-updating of the tried 'Monkey's Paw' variety' but in Ott's inimitable hands the story becomes less a morality play for children than a menacing reality check for adults. 'Washing Day', the collection's second story, follows the path of an assassin on the trail of a former magician - the assassin quickly learns that there are perils in following a white rabbit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:249308fa943d15599329dc29d03645ca1bf58a6a","amp;dn":"Thomas+Ott+-+Dead+End","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"249308fa943d15599329dc29d03645ca1bf58a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,147,8,250,148,61,21,89,147,41,220,41,208,54,69,202,27,245,138,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
