It is the story of big mountain skiing, a sport that barely existed 35 years ago.\n\nIt started in the 1970s in the mountains above Chamonix, France, where skiers began to attempt ski descents so extreme that they appeared almost suicidal. Men like Anselme Baud and Patrick Vallencant were inspired by the challenge of skiing where no one thought to ski before. Now, two generations later, some of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest skiers pursue a sport where the prize is not winning, but simply experiencing the exhilaration of skiing and exploring big, wild, remote mountains.\n\nSTEEP features many of the sportÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest athletes including Bill Briggs, Stefano De Benedetti, Eric Pehota, Glen Plake, Shane McConkey, Seth Morrison, Chris Davenport, Ingrid Backstrom and Andrew McLean.\n\nThe man who is often described as the greatest big mountain skier of all, the late Doug Coombs, is the character at the center of the film. He died in a skiing accident in La Grave, France, in April, 2006.\n\nSTEEP was shot on High Definition and on film in Alaska, Wyoming, Canada, France and Iceland.\n\nVideo: Xvid 624x336 23.98fps \nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 131kbps\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1003118/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1003118/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f31e86b3cc983452af4bbb87cf23744a8a9a3fbf","amp;dn":"Steep+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f31e86b3cc983452af4bbb87cf23744a8a9a3fbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,30,134,179,204,152,52,82,175,75,187,135,207,35,116,74,138,154,63,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
