A cliff dwelling reveals the fact that an intelligent race lived on the red planet 65 million years ago, only to be driven into extinction by the crash of a giant meteor. But now the exploration of Mars is itself under threat of extinction, as the ultraconservative New Morality movement gains control of the U.S. government and cuts off all funding for the Mars program.\n\nMeanwhile, Carter Carleton, an anthropologist who was driven from his university post by unproven rape charges, has started to dig up the remains of a Martian village. Science and politics clash on two worlds as Jamie desperately tries to save the Mars program and uncover who the vanished Martians were. \n\n\nNarrated by: Stefan Rudnicki\nLength: 11 hrs and 58 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:09-22-08\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4078577f61d993a8d8470c067dc565f9a6795488","amp;dn":"Ben+Bova+-+Mars+Life+%28The+Grand+Tour+%2316%29+%5BAUDIBLE+RIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4078577f61d993a8d8470c067dc565f9a6795488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,120,87,127,97,217,147,168,216,71,12,6,125,197,101,249,166,121,84,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
