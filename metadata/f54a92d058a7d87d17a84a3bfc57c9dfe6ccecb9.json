Now this first true Mario sequel in years re-energizes the franchise with new levels and new power-ups. Plus this time Mario gets to team up with his dinosaur buddy Yoshi, who adds new possibilities to the gravity-defying game play. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s everything you love about the first game and more.\n\nMario collects stars as he travels from galaxy to galaxy. Every level is new, but the game retains the charm, sense of wonder and beauty in line with MarioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history. Mario works his way through the various levels, sometimes upside-down, sometimes floating from place to place.\nOn some stages, Mario can find an egg, smash it open and hop onto the back of Yoshi. Yoshi can use his tongue to grab items and shoot them back at enemies, or to snag attach points and swing across chasms.\nYoshi has an interesting diet. When he eats a Dash Pepper, he gets so hot and frenzied he can run up steep inclines and vertical walls. When he eats a Blimp Fruit, he inflates like a balloon and floats to new heights.\nNew power-ups include a drill that Mario uses to tunnel through the planetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surface all the way to the other side of a planet.\nSkilled players will want to collect new Comet Metals, which will unlock harder levels with even more challenges.\n\nBy Kingston100, Come visit us at northernwarriors.net for more fantastic releases\n\nNote: \n\nGame tested and working on PAL Wii FW 3.2E using NeoGamma Rev 14 (So newer versions should work fine)\nAlso, this game is a scrubbed version, the update partition has been removed\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Burn using IMGburn on slow speed i.e. 2x or 4x\n2. Place disc in Wii, use Homebrew Channel to load NeoGamma and boot from there\n3.
