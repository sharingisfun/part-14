But will it make any impression when not protected by the sentimentality of the season? Kate Rusby sings a selection of carols and some other festive tunes. She is backed by a small band, generally four musicians - a couple of guitars, an accordion and a bass, or a similar variation; on just under half of the tracks she is also joined by five musicians from the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. It is all very pleasant. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/07/kate-rusby/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/07/kate-rusby/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eafe60d2a5bcdbc79bd95af00a00f01947f39aaf","amp;dn":"kate+rusby...Sweet+Bells%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eafe60d2a5bcdbc79bd95af00a00f01947f39aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,254,96,210,165,188,219,199,155,217,90,240,10,0,240,25,71,243,154,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
