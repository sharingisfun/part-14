Exploring the world within, he finds that he and countless other beings have been brought to this vast &quot;shipworld,&quot; which contains countless alien biospheres joined both physically and by a web of n-dimensional energy. But he and his new friends Ik and Li-Jared cannot enjoy the marvels of Shipworld. Manipulated by powers beyond their knowledge, they are soon caught in a cascade of unseen forces, like the strange attractors of chaos theory, driven toward some greater purpose.\r\n\r\nWithin Shipworld lurks a malign entity known as the &quot;boojum,&quot; which is corrupting critical intelligence systems. Bandicut is inexorably drawn into battle with this force, which threatens to destroy them along with the rest of Shipworld.\r\n\r\nFor Bandicut, a long journey into the unknown has begun. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Christopher Walker\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 48 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8953ccca09002c252333b924f396e4aefaad4902","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+A.+Carver+-+Strange+Attractors+%28Chaos+Chronicles+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8953ccca09002c252333b924f396e4aefaad4902","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,83,204,202,9,0,44,37,35,51,185,36,243,150,228,174,250,173,73,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
