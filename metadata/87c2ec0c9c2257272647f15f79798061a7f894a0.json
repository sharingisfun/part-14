Homosexuality, for instance, was a mental illness until 1973, and AspergerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gained recognition in 1994 only to see its status challenged nearly twenty years later. Each revision has created controversy, but the DSM-5, the newest iteration, has shaken psychiatry to its foundations. The APA has taken fire from patients, mental health practitioners, and former members for extending the reach of psychiatry into daily life by encouraging doctors to diagnose more illnesses and prescribe more therapiesÃ¢â‚¬â€often medications whose efficacy is unknown and whose side effects are severe. CriticsÃ¢â‚¬â€including GreenbergÃ¢â‚¬â€argue that the APA should not have the naming rights to psychological pain or to the hundreds of millions of dollars the organization earns, especially when even the DSMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staunchest defenders acknowledge that the disorders listed in the book are not real illnesses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c2ec0c9c2257272647f15f79798061a7f894a0","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Woe%3A+The+DSM+and+the+Unmaking+of+Psychiatry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c2ec0c9c2257272647f15f79798061a7f894a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,194,236,12,156,34,87,39,38,71,241,95,121,121,128,97,167,248,148,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
