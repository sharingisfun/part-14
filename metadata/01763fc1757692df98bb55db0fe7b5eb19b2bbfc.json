I can not\ndecide which sets are better, the Geilguds or the Hobbs.  Both\nthough are the best Sherlock I have heard and better than any\nSherlock movies I have seen.  The only thing better is reading\nthe original stories.  Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01763fc1757692df98bb55db0fe7b5eb19b2bbfc","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+Old+Time+Radio+OTR+%28Geilgud%2C+Richardson+1955%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01763fc1757692df98bb55db0fe7b5eb19b2bbfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,118,63,193,117,118,146,223,152,187,85,219,15,231,181,235,25,178,187,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
