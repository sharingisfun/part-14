For SYMPHOBIA COLOURS: ORCHESTRATOR, ProjectSAM recorded major and minor chords with all possible transitions between them. For example, C major and F minor were recorded separately, as well as C major changing into F minor and vice versa. The result is extremely realistic, musical and evocative.\n \nThe two ensembles recorded for ORCHESTRATOR are strings performing with choir and brass performing with woodwinds. A full set of legato chords is available for these two arrangements. Major and minor chords are mapped to two regions on the keyboard, allowing you to trigger and connect them using single keys.\n \nIn addition to the legato chords, a number of other ensembles are available, including legato double basses performing with choir basses, violin with soprano sustains, various staccato chords as well as a bonus set of alternative chord orchestrations. \n\n=======[ Instruction ]===============================================================\n\nFor Kontakt 5.3 (and above)\n\n--- [ METHOD I ] ---\n\n- Open Kontakt 5.3 (and above)\n- Go to File tab\n- Browse for the torrent folder\n- Drag n Drop the NKI files into the Right Panel to use.\n\n--- [ METHOD II ] ---\n\n- Go to Library tab\n- Click Add Library\n- Browse for the library folder's location\n- Click Ok/Yes\n- Accept or Yes when asked\n\n=======[ Extra ]=====================================================================\n\nI DO NOT OWN THIS PRODUCT - IF YOU ENJOY IT, PLEASE CONSIDER BUYING TO SUPPORT OWNER!\n\n=======[ Greets ]====================================================================\n\nGreeting to awesome uploaders:\n\n- deepstatus\n- NewSky006\n- imafaggot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a5aae216b9b58cecb993c34a6ac4b61865fc343","amp;dn":"ProjectSAM+-+Symphobia+Colours%3A+Orchestrator+%5BKONTAKT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a5aae216b9b58cecb993c34a6ac4b61865fc343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,90,174,33,107,155,88,206,203,153,60,52,166,172,75,97,134,95,195,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
