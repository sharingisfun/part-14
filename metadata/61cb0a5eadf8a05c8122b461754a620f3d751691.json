Mux the media in an MKV so that it's just the video and DTS-HD MA track b/c this method as far as I can tell won't work with just the dts file as it cannot get the correct runtime\n\n2.  Copy the contents of the included SoundOut folder to your C:Program Files (x86)AviSynth 2.5plugins directory\n\n3.  Run LAVFilters-0.61.1.exe as administrator and follow prompts\n\n4.  Copy the included dtsdecoderdll.dll (the same one from first torrent) to C:Program Files (x86)LAV Filters, C:Program Files (x86)LAV Filtersx64, and C:Program Files (x86)LAV Filtersx86 because I don't quite know where it belongs haha\n\n5.  If you don't have MPC-HC, run MPC-HC.1.7.3.x86.exe and do the standard install\n\n6.  Run graphstudionext.exe and if there are any blocks already in graph delete them\n\n7.  Click Graph &gt; Insert Filter\n\n8.  Double click &quot;LAV Splitter Source&quot; and at prompt select your mkv file\n\n9.  Double click &quot;LAV Audio Decoder&quot;, then close filter menu\n\n10. Drag the LAV Audio Decoder box to the right of your source box for visual brevity\n\n11. Click and drag the audio output opening on your source to the input opening on the LAV Audio Decoder to connect them\n\n12. Save it and take note of the location\n\n13. Open the script.avs (double clicking should open it in notepad for you\n\n14. Fill in location to your .grf and also the .w64 it will output, then save\n\n15. Open MPC-HC.  click and drag the script.avs to the MPC-HC window\n\n\nA window should appear showing the progress.  When time remaining reaches 0, give it about 20 seconds then close it and MPC-HC :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61cb0a5eadf8a05c8122b461754a620f3d751691","amp;dn":"DTS-HD+MA+6.1+decoding+fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61cb0a5eadf8a05c8122b461754a620f3d751691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,203,10,94,173,248,160,92,129,34,180,97,117,74,98,15,61,117,22,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
