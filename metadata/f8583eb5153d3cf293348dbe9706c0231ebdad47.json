As Grace digs deeper behind the facade of the Bishops' outwardly respectable lives, it starts to become clear that all is not at all as it first seemed. And then he digs just a little too far, and suddenly the fragile stability of his own troubled, private world is facing destruction ...Praise for &quot;Looking Good Dead&quot;: 'James is a master plotter ...this follow-up to &quot;Dead Simple&quot; cannot fail to thrill' - &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

When more women are assaulted, Grace becomes increasingly certain that they are dealing with the same man.
