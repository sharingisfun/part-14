(Wiley, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781119113805\r\n\r\nA complete, up-to-date, introductory guide to fuel cell technology and application\r\n\r\nFuel Cell Fundamentals provides a thorough introduction to the principles and practicalities behind fuel cell technology. Beginning with the underlying concepts, the discussion explores fuel cell thermodynamics, kinetics, transport, and modeling before moving into the application side with guidance on system types and design, performance, costs, and environmental impact. This new third edition has been updated with the latest technological advances and relevant calculations, and enhanced chapters on advanced fuel cell design and electrochemical and hydrogen energy systems. Worked problems, illustrations, and application examples throughout lend a real-world perspective, and end-of chapter review questions and mathematical problems reinforce the material learned.\r\n\r\nFuel cells produce more electricity than batteries or combustion engines, with far fewer emissions. This book is the essential introduction to the technology that makes this possible, and the physical processes behind this cost-saving and environmentally friendly energy source.\r\n\r\n    Understand the basic principles of fuel cell physics\r\n    Compare the applications, performance, and costs of different systems\r\n    Master the calculations associated with the latest fuel cell technology\r\n    Learn the considerations involved in system selection and design\r\n\r\nAs more and more nations turn to fuel cell commercialization amidst advancing technology and dropping deployment costs, global stationary fuel cell revenue is expected to grow from $1.4 billion to $40.0 billion by 2022. The sector is forecasted to explode, and there will be a tremendous demand for high-level qualified workers with advanced skills and knowledge of fuel cell technology. Fuel Cell Fundamentals is the essential first step toward joining the new energy revolution","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e271d4cd5eb66e98acbb28622dc8056440214b99","amp;dn":"Fuel+Cell+Fundamentals+3rd+ed+-+Ryan+O%27Hayre+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e271d4cd5eb66e98acbb28622dc8056440214b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,113,212,205,94,182,110,152,172,187,40,98,45,200,5,100,64,33,75,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
