It was released as a double album in the USA, and as a single disc in the United Kingdom. It debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart at number 12 on 2 November 2002. It spent 42 weeks on the chart. It was certified gold on 12 November 2002, and platinum on 10 January 2003, by the RIAA.[2] The US version contained the highly successful Californian era of Fleetwood Mac's work (1975 onwards). It also featured the B-side &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, the previously unreleased The Dance performance of &quot;Go Insane&quot;, and several rare single remixes of key tracks, such as &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot;. The enhanced section contained rare live performances, interviews, music videos and footage of the band making their next album. The UK version of 2002 was not enhanced, and contained a few songs from the Peter Green-led blues era of Fleetwood Mac..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Monday Morning\n[02] Dreams\n[03] You Make Loving Fun\n[04] Go Your Own Way\n[05] Rhiannon [Single Version]\n[06] Say You Love Me\n[07] Im So Afraid [Live]\n[08] Silver Springs\n[09] Over My Head [Single Version]\n[10] Never Going Back Again\n[11] Sara\n[12] Love In Store\n[13] Tusk\n[14] Landslide\n[15] Songbird\n[16] Big Love [Live]\n[17] Storms\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:05m:59s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] The Chain\n[02] Dont Stop\n[03] What Makes You Think Youre The One\n[04] Gypsy\n[05] Second Hand News\n[06] Little Lies\n[07] Think About Me (Single Version)\n[08] Go Insane (Live, 1997)\n[09] Gold Dust Woman\n[10] Hold Me\n[11] Seven Wonders\n[12] World Turning\n[13] Everywhere\n[14] Sisters Of The Moon (Single Version)\n[15] Family Man\n[16] As Long As You Follow\n[17] No Questions Asked\n[18] Skies The Limit\n[19] Paper Doll\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 01h:15m:00s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 02h:20m:59s\nTotal File Size....................... 936mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
