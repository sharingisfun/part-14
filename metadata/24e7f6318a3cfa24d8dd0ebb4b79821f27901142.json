The album was a follow-up to their highly successful album Back in Black. For Those About to Rock has sold over 4 million copies in the US. It was AC/DC's first and only No. 1 album in the USA until the release of Black Ice in October 2008. In their original 1981 review, Rolling Stone magazine declared it to be their best album. The album was the third and final produced for the band by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange.\nThe name of the album was inspired by a book Angus Young read, entitled For Those About To Die, We Salute You, about Roman gladiators. The gladiators' final words to the emperor were &quot;Ave Caesar morituri te salutant&quot; - or, &quot;Hail Caesar, we who are about to die, salute you.&quot; The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\nRecorded in a rehearsal space on the outskirts of Paris. The band had found it difficult to come up with their desired sound while on their previous rehearsing location (an abandoned factory in France). The album became AC/DC's first US No. 1 album. After its release the band embarked on its first arena tour of North America (late 1981 through early 1982). For the title track, large cannons were placed on stage, set to go off in accordance with the song on the album. In Spain, early copies of the album featured a sleeve with the colours reversed, i.e., a gold cannon on a black background. The title track's popularity was such that in every live concert AC/DC has done thereafter, the song is performed as an encore and is always accompanied by firing cannons on stage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24e7f6318a3cfa24d8dd0ebb4b79821f27901142","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+For+Those+About+To+Rock+%281981%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvillage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24e7f6318a3cfa24d8dd0ebb4b79821f27901142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,231,246,49,138,60,250,36,216,221,14,187,75,121,130,31,39,144,17,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
