But two years later, when Nightingale is a struggling Private Eye, the words come back to haunt him. Nightingale discovers that he was adopted at birth and that his real father, a confirmed Satanist, sold NightingaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul to a demon from Hell. And on his thirty-third birthday Ã¢â‚¬â€œ just weeks away Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the demon is coming to claim its prize.\n\n2 - MIDNIGHT\nJack Nightingale has to save a soul Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. But to save her he has to find her, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been separated since birth. When everyone Jack talks to about his sister dies horribly, he realises that someone, or something, is determined to keep them apart. If heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to save her, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to have to do what he does best Ã¢â‚¬â€œ negotiate. But any negotiation with the forces of darkness comes at a terrible price. And first Jack must ask himself the question: is every soul worth saving?\n\n3 - NIGHTMARE\nWhat goes around, comes around. Jack Nightingale learned that as a cop and discovered that it was just as true in the world of the supernatural. His life changed forever on the day he failed to stop a young girl throwing herself to her death. Ever since, he's been haunted by thoughts that he could have done more to save her. Now her cries for help are louder than ever. Is she trapped in eternal torment? Can Nightingale put things right? Or are the forces of darkness torturing and deceiving him in order to gain the ultimate prize - his soul? Nightingale will have to face down the powers of the police, south London gangs and Hell itself to find out. And evil is closer than he thinks . . .\n\nepub,mobi and txt.\n\nplease buy the books if you like them to support the authors.
