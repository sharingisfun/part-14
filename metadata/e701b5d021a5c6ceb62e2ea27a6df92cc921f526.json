Where does this strange view come from? Is the term &quot;rapture&quot; even in the Bible?\n\nClearly, the idea of the Rapture can be considered the most preposterous belief in Biblical Christianity. The situation regarding the doctrine of the Rapture is painfully similar to the famous quote by Dr. Richard Feynman, speaking of quantum physics:\n\nI think it is safe to say that no one understands quantum mechanics... in fact, it is often stated of all the theories proposed in this century, the silliest is quantum theory. Some say that the only thing that quantum theory has going for it, in fact, is that it is unquestionably correct.\n\nThis DVD includes notes in PDF format and MP3 files.\n\nEncoding: :Divx\nFormat: Color, Fullscreen\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nAudio Encoding: Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo\nRun Time: 2 hour(s)\nNumber of discs: 1\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e701b5d021a5c6ceb62e2ea27a6df92cc921f526","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Chuck+Missler+-+The+Rapture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e701b5d021a5c6ceb62e2ea27a6df92cc921f526","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,1,181,208,33,165,198,206,182,46,46,162,122,109,249,44,201,33,245,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
