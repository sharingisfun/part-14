The authors provide a firm foundation in algebraic concepts and prompt students to apply their understanding to relevant examples and applications they are likely to encounter in college or in their careers. The program addresses the needs of students at all levels--and in particular those who may have struggled in previous algebra courses--offering an abundance of examples and exercises that reinforce concepts and make learning more dynamic. The early introduction of functions in Chapter 1 ensures compatibility with syllabi and provides a framework for student learning. Optional Discovery and Exploration activities are integrated throughout the text; instructors can also opt to use graphing technology as a tool for problem solving and review or retention. This Enhanced Edition includes instant access to Enhanced WebAssign, the most widely-used and reliable homework system. Enhanced WebAssign presents over a thousand problems, links to relevant textbook sections, video examples, problem-specific tutorials, and more, that help students grasp the concepts needed to succeed in this course. As an added bonus, the Start Smart Guide has been bound into this text. This guide contains instructions to help students learn the basics of WebAssign quickly.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 611 pages\n# Publisher: Brooks Cole; 1 edition (April 16, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 143904788X\n# ISBN-13: 978-1439047880","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180b8a3394df34ad3c54f7a7bfb57df0b5756951","amp;dn":"College+Algebra+with+Applications+for+Business+and+Life+Sciences","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180b8a3394df34ad3c54f7a7bfb57df0b5756951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,11,138,51,148,223,52,173,60,84,247,167,191,181,125,240,181,117,105,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
