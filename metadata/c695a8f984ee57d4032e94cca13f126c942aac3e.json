This pack is perfect for evoking those memories of childhood holidays in Dawlish or for those too young, to see what it was like seeing these loud diesels hurtle along the sea wall.\n\nIn these scenarios, we've strived for realism in all areas. For example, each scenario represents actual workings featured in the 1983/1984 working timetable to create an as realistic experience as possible. As well as this, prototypical rolling stock formations are used where possible with all services having their headcode, time of leaving, origin and destination as their name so you can see which train is which!\n\nOn top of this, we have colour matched all BR liveried stock used in this pack to the best of our ability to give consistency and a more immersive experience; something that has perhaps been lacking in previous BR-era scenarios. If that wasn't enough, we have also developed a number of high definition reskins for the rolling stock listed below:\n\nClass 31\n\nClass 33\n\nClass 43 + Mk3 coaches (HST)\n\nClass 47\n\nRequirements\n\nExtra Stock - Download\n\nRS.com Riviera Line: Exeter to Paignton \n\nArmstrong Powerhouse Mk1 Coach Pack \n\nArmstrong Powerhouse Mk2E Coach Pack \n\nDigital Traction British Railways Wagons  \n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¹RS.com BR Class 31 Freight Loco\n\nRS.com BR Class 33 \n\nRS.com BR Class 50 \n\nRS.com BR Class 101\n\nRS.com European Community Asset Pack \n\nEnjoy people","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c695a8f984ee57d4032e94cca13f126c942aac3e","amp;dn":"AP38%3A+Riviera+Line+Scenario+Pack+BR+1980s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c695a8f984ee57d4032e94cca13f126c942aac3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,149,168,249,132,238,87,212,3,46,148,204,161,63,18,108,148,42,172,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
