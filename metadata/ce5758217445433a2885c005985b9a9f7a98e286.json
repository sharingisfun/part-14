When The Beatles' albums were first released on Compact Disc, this series was put together so that The Beatles' entire catalogue of released work would be available on CD. None of these songs (in the versions included on this album) are found on any of The Beatles' original non-compilation albums released in the United Kingdom up to 1970.\n\t\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nSide One\n&quot;Love Me Do&quot;\n&quot;From Me to You&quot;\n&quot;Thank You Girl&quot;\n&quot;She Loves You&quot;\n&quot;I'll Get You&quot;\n&quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;\n&quot;This Boy&quot;\n&quot;Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand&quot;\n&quot;Sie Liebt Dich&quot;\n\nSide Two\n&quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;\n&quot;I Call Your Name&quot;\n&quot;Slow Down&quot;\n&quot;Matchbox&quot;\n&quot;I Feel Fine&quot;\n&quot;She's a Woman&quot;\n&quot;Bad Boy&quot;\n&quot;Yes It Is&quot;\n&quot;I'm Down&quot;\n\nSide Three\n&quot;Day Tripper&quot;\n&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;\n&quot;Paperback Writer&quot;\n&quot;Rain&quot;\n&quot;Lady Madonna&quot;\n&quot;The Inner Light&quot;\n&quot;Hey Jude&quot;\n&quot;Revolution&quot;\n\nSide Four\n&quot;Get Back&quot;\n&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;\n&quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;\n&quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot;\n&quot;Across the Universe&quot; (&quot;Wildlife version&quot;)\n&quot;Let It Be&quot;\n&quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot;\n\n\nRipping Equipment\n\nNitty Gritty RCM 1.5\nTechnics SL-1200MK2 Turntable\nOrtofon 2M Black Phono Cartridge\nPro-Ject Tube Box SE II Preamp\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nMonster Cable interconnects\nBias Peak LE 6 recording software\n\nRCM - TT - Ortofon 2M Black - Tube Box preamp - Mac Pro Dual Xeon - Peak LE @ 24/96 - manual click removal analyze (no clipping, no DC Bias offset) - NO Click Repair used on Volume 1, CR 10 Rev, X2 used on Vol 2 - split into individual Tracks - FLAC encoded XLD 20090824a (109.2)\n\nNo silence been removed, please burn gapless to match original track layout.\n\n\n\n\nPlease check out The 2010 Doc Rob Vinyl Remasters: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5993150/The_Beatles_-_The_Collection_%5BMFSL%5D_%5BVinyl%5D_-_Dr._Robert&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5993150/The_Beatles_-_The_Collection_%5BMFSL%5D_%5BVinyl%5D_-_Dr._Robert&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce5758217445433a2885c005985b9a9f7a98e286","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Past+Masters+Volume+1+%26+2+%5BVinyl%5D-Dr.+Robert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce5758217445433a2885c005985b9a9f7a98e286","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,87,88,33,116,69,67,58,40,133,192,5,152,91,154,159,122,152,226,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
