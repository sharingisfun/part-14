The new algorithm uses information from a much wider area when reconstructing image detail, helping to minimize artefacts which contribute to the 'digital look'. This latest release also applies noise reduction during the demosaicing process thus avoiding unnecessary amplification of noise artefacts. DxO Optics Pro adds support for the Canon 5D Mark II and the Canon G10, along with 32 new DxO Optics correction modules. In addition, this new version includes various improvements, including installation of the plug-in version for Adobe Photoshop. DxO Optics Pro and upgrades are available immediately for Mac and Windows platforms.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;DxO Optics Pro&quot;: \n\n* RAW conversion and state-of-the art camera noise removal for colorful images and details even at the highest ISO settings \n* Elimination of distortion, vignetting, and lens softness and purple fringing through specifically developed camera and lens modules \n* Correction of perspective and volume anamorphosis Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Optimization of exposure and dynamic range \n* Color control with access to original film color renderings\n* Removal of dust and blemis\n\nEnhancements since the version 7.0.0 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 5 new supported bodies : Olympus PEN EP3, E-PL3, E-PM1, Panasonic Lumix G3, Sony SLT A65 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 150 new DxO optics modules \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Performance enhancement of 5% \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Performance enhancements with old configurations \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Filter options are now restored after a program restart \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New filter for images generated with Optics Pro\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Improved image quality at high ISO\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Improved tools for correction of optical defects\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Automatic restoration of exposure for the most difficult subjects\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Completely redesigned and more intuitive interface\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Personalization of the interface to improve productivity\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Support for new cameras and lenses\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Improved performance of the overall program.\n\nWhat's New in 7.1.0 Rev. 24002 Build 104:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fix of a problem of path fixing when images are moved \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fix of a problem of using the preset editor \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fix of a display problem with configurations with Intel Chipset GMA 965 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fix of a problem when processing images to DNG on 32-bit systems \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 10 most frequent crashs fixed \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fix of a problem of listing external disks \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fix of a problem of reading folders \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fix of a problem of DxO optics modules not working with version 6 since Optics Pro 7 is installed \nOpenCL Speed improvement for the Fuji X100 and better image quality at high ISOs\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 157 new lens / camera combinations have been added to the DxO Optics Modules library, providing supports for Sigma, Tamron, Olympusn Panasonic, Sony, Zeiss, and Minolta lenses, for numerous Canon, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus, Panasonic, and Sony cameras.\n\nSystem requirements Windows:\n\nMicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows XP SP3 (32), VISTA (32 ou 64-bit), 7 (32 ou 64-bit)\nProcessor: Intel CoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 2 Duo or higher, AMD AthlonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 64 X2 or higher\nGraphics card: Support of DirectX 9.0.c or higher for Windows operating systems; 256 MB VRAM recommended to support GPU acceleration\nA 64-bit system is recommended for processing images taken with cameras having a sensor size greater than 20 Megapixels.\nMemory necessary: 2 Gigabytes of RAM (3 Gigabytes of RAM is recommended for processing images taken with cameras having a sensor size greater than 20 Megapixels).\nDisk space necessary: Running the software requires a minimum of 2 GB on the hard drive.
