The Last in a Long Line (02:26)\n\nThe Leisure Society's third album is a quintessential curate's egg, with plenty of earnest folk-rock strummage, and a few brilliant highlights distracting from several songs as weak as their punning titles, notably Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life Is a CabrioletÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“One Man and His FugÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fight for EveryoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ overdoes the chumminess, with chipper guitar and warm horns supporting its contention that Ã¢â‚¬Å“you just need fire and a little faithÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but elsewhere Nick Hemming's lyrical eye is more profitably applied to subjects like Sylvia Plath in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Sober Scent of PaperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Softer Voice Takes Longer HearingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Best of all is Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Go TogetherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a touching celebration of enduring love strongly reminiscent of the work of Pete Atkin and Clive James.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3843629def07193f1de7dabb526f07c9423f8998","amp;dn":"The+Leisure+Society+-+Alone+Aboard+the+Ark+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3843629def07193f1de7dabb526f07c9423f8998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,67,98,157,239,7,25,63,29,231,218,187,82,111,7,201,66,63,137,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
