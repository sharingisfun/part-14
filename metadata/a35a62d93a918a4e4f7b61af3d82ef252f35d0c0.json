If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a35a62d93a918a4e4f7b61af3d82ef252f35d0c0","amp;dn":"Partition+Wizard+Home+Edition+5.0+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a35a62d93a918a4e4f7b61af3d82ef252f35d0c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,90,98,217,58,145,138,78,79,123,97,175,61,130,239,37,47,53,208,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
