But the band enjoyed some other major and minor hits in the U.K., including a top-notch Merseyization of Betty Everett's (and later Linda Ronstadt's) &quot;You're No Good,&quot; which they took into the British Top Five in 1964.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-swinging-blue-jeans-p20889/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-swinging-blue-jeans-p20889/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nAll of their U.K. and U.S. hits are included on this compilation. Highlights are &quot;You're No Good,&quot; &quot;Hippy Hippy Shake,&quot; and their fine (pre-Who) cover of Johnny Kidd's &quot;Shakin' All Over,&quot; though even for the Anglophile, about half of this CD is forgettable, especially the dreary post-1966 stuff. This anthology includes several non-LP/rare singles and unreleased songs.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/hippy-hippy-shake-the-definitive-collection-r170352&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/hippy-hippy-shake-the-definitive-collection-r170352&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DR4P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DR4P&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
