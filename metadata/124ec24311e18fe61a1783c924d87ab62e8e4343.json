(Not unlike how the Nazis did twenty years before.) \n\nHe died on November 3rd 1957 in Lewisburgh Penitentiary. In his will, Reich stated that his unpublished papers were to be locked away until the year 2007, 50 years after his death, when as he put it,\n\n&quot;man would be ready for his concepts.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:124ec24311e18fe61a1783c924d87ab62e8e4343","amp;dn":"Wilhelm+Reich+-+Man%5C%27s+Right+to+Know","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"124ec24311e18fe61a1783c924d87ab62e8e4343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,78,194,67,17,225,143,230,26,23,131,201,36,216,122,182,46,142,67,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
