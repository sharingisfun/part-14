With his years of action-packed mission experience and a top training role, Lieutenant Commander Denver understands exactly how tomorrow?s soldiers are recruited, sculpted, motivated, and deployed.\n\nNow, Denver takes you inside his personal story and the fascinating, demanding SEAL training program he now oversees. He recounts his experience evolving from a young SEAL hopeful pushing his way through Hell Week, into a warrior engaging in dangerous stealth missions across the globe, and finally into a lieutenant commander directing the indoctrination, requalification programs, and the ?Hero or Zero? missions his SEALs undertake.\n\nFrom his own SEAL training and missions overseas, Denver details how the SEALs? creative operations became front and center in America?s War on Terror?and how they are altering warfare everywhere. In fourteen years as a SEAL officer, Rorke Denver tangled with drug lords in Latin America, stood up to violent mobs in Liberia, and battled terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan. Leading 200 commando missions, he earned the Bronze Star with V for valor. He has also served as flag aide to the admiral in charge and spent the past four years as executive officer of the Navy Special Warfare Center?s Advanced Training Command in Coronado, California, directing all phases of the basic and advanced training that prepare men for war in SEAL teams. He recently starred in the film Act of Valor. He is married and has two daughters.\n\nEllis Henican is a columnist at Newsday and an on-air commentator at the Fox News Channel. He has written two recent New York Times bestsellers, Home Team with New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton and In the Blink of an Eye with NASCAR legend Michael Waltrip.\n\nWith all the SEALs? recent successes, we have been getting a level of acclaim we?re not used to. But something important has been missing in this warm burst of publicityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Correcting that is my mission here.\nMy own SEAL dream was launched by a book. My hope is that this one teaches lessons that go far beyond the battlefield, inspiring a fresh generation of warriors to carry on that dream.\n?Lieutenant Commander Rorke Denver[/code]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56dc99d07656b212a4f09409adced279d857e78c","amp;dn":"Rorke+Denver+and+Ellis+Henican+-+Damn+Few+epub+and+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56dc99d07656b212a4f09409adced279d857e78c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,220,153,208,118,86,178,18,164,240,148,9,173,206,210,121,216,87,231,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
