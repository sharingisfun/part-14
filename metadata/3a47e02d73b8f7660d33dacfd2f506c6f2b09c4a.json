Corson's amazing book Consequences of Failure (1974) which explores the nature and meaning of the United States' military failure in Vietnam and assesses its impact in America. Lieutenant-Colonel William R. Corson USMC carefully explains how mismanagement, self-deception and corruption caused the failure of the American military effort in Vietnam. Before retiring from the Marine Corps, the author worked with both senior Pentagon officials and top White House advisors. First, the author says, one must understand that Americans have not experienced a defeat but a &quot;military failure&quot; - a phenomenon with distinct characteristics. How a nation reacts to the fact of failure depends on how honest it is in evaluating its situation. Corson presents case studies of earlier failures suffered by ancient Rome, Spain, and Britain. He examines the consequences of failure on the U.S. military establishment, government, youth, middle class, and the economy. Consequences of Failure is a careful analysis of failure and its consequences as viewed through several different cultural and historical perspectives. Utilizing pivotal periods in differing cultural histories, from countries across Europe, Corson reveals the consequences dealt with and and the lessons learned. Failure is, in author's mind, a constructive force when a given people grapple with the consequences of failure with a mind to reformulating the concept and consequences in a manner which facilitates a positive return. 200 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a47e02d73b8f7660d33dacfd2f506c6f2b09c4a","amp;dn":"Corson+-+Consequences+of+Failure+%28analysis+of+US+military+failur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a47e02d73b8f7660d33dacfd2f506c6f2b09c4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,71,224,45,115,184,247,102,13,51,218,207,210,245,6,198,242,176,156,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
