Overdubs and guest musicians are kept to an effective minimum. With that lean arrangement, the band reveals a thousand tales, a dizzying timelessness, and a potent range of emotions. Two Gallants rambled thousands of miles, across counties and continents, to make what the toll tells. Their sophomore album swells with the kind of world-weary storytelling and musical dexterity that arises from travel, loss, and triumph coupled with an unusual affection for literature and legend. But it all starts and ends with their home, the city streets of San Francisco.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64acf0b4c9c20f965014da55d80835537cb7033e","amp;dn":"Two+Gallants+-+What+The+Toll+Tells+%5B2006+Audio+CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64acf0b4c9c20f965014da55d80835537cb7033e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,172,240,180,201,194,15,150,80,20,218,85,216,8,53,83,124,183,3,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
