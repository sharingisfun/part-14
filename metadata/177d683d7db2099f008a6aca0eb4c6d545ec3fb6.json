The 2003 release of Bossas and Ballads: The Lost Sessions, containing music that was recorded in 1989 but not issued at the time for business reasons, adds one more sterling example.\n\nThe &quot;Bossas&quot; in the title are five engaging Barron tunes, while the &quot;Ballads&quot; are Mal Waldron's &quot;Soul Eyes,&quot; Thad Jones' &quot;Yours and Mine,&quot; Russ Freeman's &quot;The Wind&quot; and Sam Rivers' &quot;Beatrice,&quot; although the last is taken at a medium-groove tempo. On each tune, Getz produces a sound that is as gorgeous as at any time he achieved in his career-pure and emotion-filled. And his lyrical ideas continuously overflow with the ease afforded by his celebrated mastery of time and his instrument.\n\nBarron, who at Getz's insistence received equal billing on People Time, qualifies for that status here as well. His long, tuneful lines, with their faultless rhythmic placement, fit ideally with the leader's own musical sensibility. With drummer Victor Lewis and bassist George Mraz also having accompanied Getz for several years, ensemble cohesion is a given. Lewis consistently plays with exquisite taste while Mraz contributes rock-solid time articulated with a magnificent tone.\n\nA quarter century after spearheading the bossa nova movement in America, Stan Getz brings a bit less lilt to the form, but more body, never resting on his inventions.\n\n\n\nCD / Verve / 2003 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
