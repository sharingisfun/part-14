What are the sounds and what do they mean? What shocking revelations will the answer provide?\n\n&quot;The Sobbing Stone&quot; is a no-budget Christian film directed by Robert G. Christie. The directing and editing is some of the worst I've seen in years. And the plot is based around the &quot;mystery&quot; of the stone but the big revelation in the &quot;twist&quot; ending is obvious from the very start. According to the credits the film is based on a play. I wonder if it was ever produced on stage. \n\nIn fact, this may very well be the worst Christian film ever made outside of Nigeria. It has an impressive IMDb rating of 1,3/10 and it deserves it. \n\nThis film is &quot;family approved&quot; by the Dove Foundation.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456007&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456007&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e052bb99bf45704c6967eace04bf8e19755910be","amp;dn":"The+Sobbing+Stone+2005+%28christian+movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e052bb99bf45704c6967eace04bf8e19755910be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,82,187,153,191,69,112,76,105,103,234,206,4,191,142,25,117,89,16,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
