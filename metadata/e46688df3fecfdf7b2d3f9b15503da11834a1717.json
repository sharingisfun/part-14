LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compare a few other languages to JavaScript:\nSmalltalk has objects, but a Smalltalk objectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s methods and instance variables are distinct from the contents of a Smalltalk container like a dictionary or array. JavaScriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s objects are dictionaries, and an objectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s methods and instance variables are the same thing as its contents.\nRuby has classes, modules, the metaclasses, and eigenclasses. JavaScript just has objects that are related to each other either with prototype chaining or as instance values.\nWhen you invoke a method in Common Lisp, You may also be invoking multiple Ã¢â‚¬Å“before,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“after,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“aroundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ demons in addition to the method handler. In JavaScript, each method is handled by exactly one function.\nJavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s methods cannot be added to or removed from classes once their bytecodes have been loaded. JavaScriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s methods can be added and removed at any time.\n\n\n\nKeep Learning and help us to share the Knowledge across the World.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e46688df3fecfdf7b2d3f9b15503da11834a1717","amp;dn":"JavaScript+Spessore+-+Leanpub+%282014%29+PDF+-+GOLU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e46688df3fecfdf7b2d3f9b15503da11834a1717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,102,136,223,63,236,253,247,178,211,249,177,85,3,218,17,131,74,23,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
