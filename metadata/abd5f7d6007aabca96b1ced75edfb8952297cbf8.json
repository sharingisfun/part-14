Although a straight CD reissue of the original LP, the playing time is over 61 minutes. The group interprets &quot;For All We Know&quot; and seven Evans originals including &quot;Peri's Scope&quot; and &quot;Five.&quot; The thoughtful session is full of lyrical melodies and strong solos; even Evans's electric keyboard work on a few tunes is distinctive.\n\n(Downloaded from BTDigg - not my rip - organized, added tags and info.txt)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abd5f7d6007aabca96b1ced75edfb8952297cbf8","amp;dn":"Bill+Evans+-+We+Will+Meet+Again+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BHDTracks%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abd5f7d6007aabca96b1ced75edfb8952297cbf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,213,247,214,0,122,171,202,150,177,206,215,94,223,184,149,34,151,203,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
