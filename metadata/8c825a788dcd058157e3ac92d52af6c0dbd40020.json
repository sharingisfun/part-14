But that plan falls into tatters when his mother sponsors his sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend and enlists him to dance with her at AlmackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. The beautiful vixen he meets that night bears little resemblance to the shy, gangly girl who used to follow him around.

But he waits until after they are married to tell his wife that he intends to have another man father that heir. His careful plan becomes complicated by an almost desperate need to claim Louisa for himself and an outside threat that proves even more dangerous than his illness.\n\n#2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Beguiling the Earl\nCatherine Evans knows the Earl of Kerrick is the one man for her. During her first season, she hopes he will come to feel the same way about her. \nKerrick has tried to see his best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister-in-law as a younger sister. But just when he realizes his feelings for her go much deeper than friendship, duty compels him to court another woman. \nIt is supposed to be a brief courtship in name only, but outside forces seem determined to see Kerrick married to that other woman and to keep him and Catherine apart. \n\n\nNote: More than most of the books that i have uploaded / will upload i BUY and share (unless it is not stated)..\nBook #2 was bought..\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
