Without any reminiscing about their former band, Operation Ivy, Matt Freeman (bass) and Tim Armstrong (guitar/vocals) blast through their debut without any hints of ska or blatant Clash plagiarizing. On the contrary, this album rips through 15 tracks of high-energy punk that's accompanied by heavy bass leads and Armstrong's permanently slurred vocals. And to top it all off, the lyrical content deals with urban blight and the lifestyle of being a public nuisance. With this trademark sound, Rancid provide the perfect soundtrack for any car chase that includes massive property damage; is it a wonder MTV wouldn't touch this?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c57081d621bd072a6a2f064e943e5efde5b5ce2c","amp;dn":"Rancid-Rancid+1993+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c57081d621bd072a6a2f064e943e5efde5b5ce2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,112,129,214,33,189,7,42,106,47,6,78,148,62,94,253,229,181,206,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
