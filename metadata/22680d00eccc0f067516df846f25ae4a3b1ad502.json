The vast scope of chemicals that cross the blood-brain barrier boggle the very brain they reach: cannabis and cocaine, antipsychotics and antidepressants, alcohol, amphetamines, and Ecstasy--and much more.\n\nHe clarifies the differences between morphine and heroin, mescaline and LSD, and other similar substances. Drugged brims with surprises, revealing the fact that antidepressant drugs evolved from the rocket fuel that shot V2 rockets into London during World War II, highlighting the role of hallucinogens in the history of religion, and asking whether Prozac can help depressed cats.\n\nEntertaining and authoritative, Drugged is a truly fascinating book.  \n\nAuthor:\n\nRichard Miller is Alfred Newton Richards Professor of Pharmacology at Northwestern University. He has authored or co-authored more than 400 papers and journal articles on molecular pharmacology and biological chemistry.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22680d00eccc0f067516df846f25ae4a3b1ad502","amp;dn":"Drugged%3A+The+Science+and...++%282014%29+Richard+J+Miller+%28multi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22680d00eccc0f067516df846f25ae4a3b1ad502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,104,13,0,236,204,15,6,117,22,223,132,111,37,174,74,59,26,213,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
