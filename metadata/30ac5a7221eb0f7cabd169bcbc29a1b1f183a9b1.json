In this comprehensive biography Randi challenges Uri Geller's assertion that he performs paranormal feats. Randi explores Geller's background as a stage magician, and explains how Geller's spoon bending can be easily reproduced by any magician using sleight of hand.\n\nPublisher: James Randi Educational Foundation (August 28, 2011)\n\nThis is the official Kindle Edition MOBI, which I converted to EPUB using Calibre. I tested the EPUB in iBooks on my iPad to make sure the conversion settings I used made it appear the same as the MOBI in the Kindle app. Sometimes Calibre conversions can mess up a book's formatting, but you can be confident that this EPUB conversion is just like the original.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30ac5a7221eb0f7cabd169bcbc29a1b1f183a9b1","amp;dn":"The+Truth+About+Uri+Geller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30ac5a7221eb0f7cabd169bcbc29a1b1f183a9b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,172,90,114,33,235,15,124,171,209,105,188,188,41,161,177,241,131,169,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
