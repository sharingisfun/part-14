With an emphasis on fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs, this is a cookbook that any dessert lover will enjoy. Kaminsky insists that fresh, local produceÃ¢â‚¬â€at the peak of ripenessÃ¢â‚¬â€offers incomparable flavors that cannot be replicated with any amount of sugar, salt, or any baking extracts. As a result, her creative recipes will appeal to health-conscious bakers (all recipes are low in cholesterol and many feature natural sweeteners and whole grains), though even the sweetest sweet tooths among us will be more than satisfied by these tantalizing treats.\n\nFrom luscious lemon mousse and roasted apricot ice cream to black velvet cupcakes and almond chocolate blossoms, readers will find exciting new desserts as well as 100 percentÃ¢â‚¬â€œvegan versions of old favorites. Clear, precise directions guide readers through every step, and a mouthwatering photo accompanies each recipe. Golden saffron pound cake, no-bake pumpkin crÃƒÂ¨me brÃƒÂ»lÃƒÂ©e, black pearl truffles, chai poached pears, apricot frangipane tartÃ¢â‚¬â€this cookbook has something for every dessert lover","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80a49ddfb3176c83d90d39c6cd52b2885ce3320c","amp;dn":"Vegan+Desserts+-+Sumptuous+Sweets+for+Every+Season-Hannah+Kamins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80a49ddfb3176c83d90d39c6cd52b2885ce3320c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,164,157,223,179,23,108,131,217,13,57,198,205,82,178,136,92,227,50,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
