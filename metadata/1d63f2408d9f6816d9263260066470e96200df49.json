The sense of an organic crossover recording is reinforced by the involvement of co-producer BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°i JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³hannsson of eccentric pop/rock/electronica-formation Bang Gang. BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°i has successfully coloured the brittle minimalism of previous releases through the addition of an array of new instruments. Those expecting a mere continuation of the minimal melancholia of his previous albums are therefore in for a surprise, as the record may be the most uplifting and richly orchestrated work of his career: 'The album has a very clear theme', Arnalds relates, 'which is that there is always light after darkness. To me, it has a more positive note than my previous works.' When ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur saw how the opening scene of a Hungarian indie film metaphorically described a solar eclipse, he instantly connected it to the concept, naming the album after a key line of the film's introductory monologue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d63f2408d9f6816d9263260066470e96200df49","amp;dn":"%C3%83%E2%80%9Clafur+Arnalds+-+...And+They+Have+Escaped+The+Weight+Of+Darknes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d63f2408d9f6816d9263260066470e96200df49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,99,242,64,141,159,104,22,217,38,50,96,6,100,112,233,98,0,223,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
