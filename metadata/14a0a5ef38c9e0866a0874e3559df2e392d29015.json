A young laborer named Yuzo (Isao Numazaki) and his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, Masako (Chieko Nakakita), meet at the train station on their day off. \nWith the weather beautiful and only a scant 35 yen in their pockets, the two first visit a model house, where Masako imagines being a housewife. Then Yuzo plays baseball with some boys, resulting in the ball landing on a cookie shop display. After buying the two crushed cookies, they pop in on a floorshow without paying admission, and then go to the zoo. Later, a scalper beats up Yuzo for trying to haggle for the price. Afterwards, they go back to his cramped room where they almost succumb to amorous feelings. Instead, they go and get coffee, where Yuzo is forced to leave his raincoat to pay for the bill. Walking past some ruins, they image running their own coffee shop. Their wonderful Sunday comes to an end with Masako hopping back on the train just after making plans for the following week.\n\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Akira Kurosawa-Subarashiki nichiyobi (&amp;#039;One Wonderful Sunday&amp;#039;) (1947).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate : 1784 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 6.98 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Japanese\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate : 1588 Kbps\n      Width : 512 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.335\n      StreamSize : 1.21 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 150 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0039871\n\nJapanese audio, English subpack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14a0a5ef38c9e0866a0874e3559df2e392d29015","amp;dn":"Subarashiki+nichiyobi+%28One+Wonderful+Sunday%29+-+Kurosawa+%281947%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14a0a5ef38c9e0866a0874e3559df2e392d29015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,160,165,239,56,201,224,134,106,8,116,227,85,157,242,227,146,210,144,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
