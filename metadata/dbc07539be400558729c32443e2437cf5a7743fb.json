The support for the Afghans, which took place via a \nPakistani corridor, according to some strained interpretiations \nled to a later jihad against westerners, which Crile claimed \nto have foreseen.Charlie WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s War has been widely and \nfavorably reviewed and is currently in its 10th printing. It \nis the basis of the Tom Hanks/Mike Nichols film, released \nin 2007.\n\nGeorge Crile was an award-winning documentary filmmaker and \nveteran producer for 60 Minutes. Charlie Wilson's War began as \na 60 Minutes profile in 1988.\n\nWinner of the 2004 Audie Award\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbc07539be400558729c32443e2437cf5a7743fb","amp;dn":"CHARLIE+WILSON%5C%27S+WAR+-+George+Crile.+Christopher+Lane+%7BFerraBit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbc07539be400558729c32443e2437cf5a7743fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,192,117,57,190,64,5,88,114,156,50,68,62,36,55,207,90,119,67,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
