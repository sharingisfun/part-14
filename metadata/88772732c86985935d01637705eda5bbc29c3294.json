The &quot;Jerome Kern Songbook&quot; is part of that magnificent Songbook series; every song on this recording is a gem and an integral part of the Great American Songbook. No one, and I mean no one, could sing a lyric like Ella. \n\nNelson Riddle arranged and conducted the studio orchestra for this album, and the orchestra features some of the great musicians of the time, including Paul Smith (Ella's long-time pianist), Frank Flynn and Dick Nash.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
