Rypdal's ensemble, which includes himself on guitar, trumpeter Palle\nMikkelborg, church organist Iver Kleive, and soprano ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦shild StubÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ Gundersen,\nwork live alongside the Bergen Chamber Ensemble conducted by Kjell Seim at\nDomkirke's Molde Jazz Festival to create a work of stunning beauty, crystalline\nsilences, and time-expanding dynamics. Over the five movements, Rypdal creates\nspecific harmonic tensions that are resolved with a creative and disciplined use\nof varying tonalities and durations. In the first movement, &quot;Luminous Galaxy,&quot;\nthe chamber ensemble and Gundersen open the piece for nearly four minutes and\nyou begin to take in and feel your way through the lush soundscape; Mikkelborg\nenters with a half note, slipping like a fine-edged knife into the heart of the\nmix. At eight minutes it's just Mikkelborg and a drone of strings before the\nensemble gradually reenters this entirely new sonic world that presents itself\nas a whole, and the musicians do so almost pastorally before Kleive's organ\nannounces its solo presence, once again courting the strings to advance into its\nsonic terrain. Before the first movement is finished, the piece comes full\ncircle just in time to create an entirely new series of landscapes propelled by\nRypdal's guitar. And so it goes. There is nothing remotely cold about this work;\nit is warm and dark and stunning in its stark presentation that is so\ndeceptively complex. By the time the fifth and title movement commences, the\nlistener has been to many worlds within the sonorous terrains of the heart. The\nlines blur between improvisation, classical music, and jazz, but also between\nsound and music and between rhythm and space, as tonal fields and textural\nplanes become refracted in reverse into an awesome whole that extends themes\nRypdal first explored in Q.E.D. and his double concerto. Terje Rypdal is making\nthe greatest music of his life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7b47bd2df909150c85ae805e253cd68bb816c02","amp;dn":"Terje+Rypdal+-+Lux+Aeterna+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7b47bd2df909150c85ae805e253cd68bb816c02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,180,123,210,223,144,145,80,200,90,232,5,226,83,205,104,187,129,108,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
