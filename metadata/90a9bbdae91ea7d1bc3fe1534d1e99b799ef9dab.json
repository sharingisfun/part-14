An expanded version was released called The Isness and the Otherness, a two disc special edition containing The Isness on disc one and The Otherness, featuring additional tracks and recordings, on disc two.\n\nThe album is the first by FSOL (as Amorphous Androgynous) to delve into psychedelic rock territory, although there are a few solid electronica tracks the majority is more progressive rock than electronica. This has came to mixed reviews with the majority being positive. Some say they had over extended their reach and others seemed to understand what they were doing.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90a9bbdae91ea7d1bc3fe1534d1e99b799ef9dab","amp;dn":"Amorphous+Androgynous+%28FSOL%29+-+The+Isness+%282002%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90a9bbdae91ea7d1bc3fe1534d1e99b799ef9dab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,169,187,218,233,30,167,209,188,63,225,83,77,30,153,183,153,239,157,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
