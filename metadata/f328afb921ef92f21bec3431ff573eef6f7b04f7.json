It works on about 70%, so don't hate on me if it doesn't, it's your choice to download.\n\nThis is an updated image for Lion 10.7.2 since people had issues updating from 10.7.1. Contains fixes for the bootup issue along with the trackpad issue (along with other fixes). Ideal for running XCode or any other Mac programs, they work as though it was a Mac, and as usual with any of my builds, there's plenty of contact information contained within the torrent should you need me (it's in the torrent so it's not broadcasted online). \n\nMake sure to watch the video link, because it details how to configure for your preferences (i.e. some stuff won't work unless you configure) and there is also valuable information on it\n\nWorks under pretty much all VMware products, only problems you may get are with video and audio (audio is easily fixable whereas video is slightly more complicated).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f328afb921ef92f21bec3431ff573eef6f7b04f7","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+Lion+10.7.2+VMware+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f328afb921ef92f21bec3431ff573eef6f7b04f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,40,175,185,33,239,146,242,27,236,52,49,255,87,62,239,111,123,4,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
