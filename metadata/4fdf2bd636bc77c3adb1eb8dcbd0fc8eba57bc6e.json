In particular Rory is inspired by Boswell's record of everything he drank, and decides to try and visit as many distilleries as possible. Their journey takes them across the Western Isles, to the isles of Jura, Mull, Skye and finally Harris, where they hope to catch the last week of the wild salmon fly fishing season.\r\n\r\n2)  Oban to Harris \r\nThey catch the ferry from Oban to Mull, where they visit Fingal's Cave, inspiration to so many writers, artists and musicians. They leave Mull onboard Mascot, a 1904 Bristol Pilot Cutter, but immediately run into trouble as they get tangled in a lobster pot. They then sail along the coast to the Knoydart Peninsula.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8c/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/73/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b0/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6b/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/Three-Men-Go-to-Scotland-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19.5 (~3600Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Part Size: 1.55 GB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV (upscaled)\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x92dm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fdf2bd636bc77c3adb1eb8dcbd0fc8eba57bc6e","amp;dn":"BBC+Three+Men+Go+to+Scotland+1of2+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fdf2bd636bc77c3adb1eb8dcbd0fc8eba57bc6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,223,43,214,54,188,119,195,173,177,235,141,203,208,252,142,186,87,188,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
