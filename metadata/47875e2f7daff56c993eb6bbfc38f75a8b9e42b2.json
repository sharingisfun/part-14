On March 7, 2006, Moonsorrow announced a 2-album contract with Spinefarm Records, and that their next album was slated for release in late 2006. \nOn June 19 it was revealed that the upcoming album would feature guest vocals by Thomas VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nen, the former vocalist of Thyrfing; Viides Luku - HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤vitetty (&quot;Chapter five - Ravaged&quot;) was released in January 2007. \nThe album contained only two tracks and displayed more overts influence from progressive rock\n\nAn EP called Tulimyrsky was released in 2008. \nThe EP is over one hour long and contains one new song (the title track), two remakes of old songs, and two cover songs. \nIt was released worldwide by Spinefarm Records, and in May the German label Drakkar Entertainment released it in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nIn Fall 2010, Moonsorrow entered the studio to record their sixth full-length studio album, with a tentative release date in February 2011.\n\n[b]Albums[/b]\n\n* Suden Uni - 2001\n* Voimasta Ja Kunniasta - 2001\n* Kivenkantaja - 2003\n* VerisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤keet - 2005\n* Viides Luku - HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤vitetty - 2007\n* Tulimyrsky - 2008\n\n[b]Data files[/b]\n\nMp3\n\nBitrate: 320 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47875e2f7daff56c993eb6bbfc38f75a8b9e42b2","amp;dn":"%5BLossy+Mp3+320+kbps%5D+Moonsorrow+-+Discography+%5BTNT+Village%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47875e2f7daff56c993eb6bbfc38f75a8b9e42b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,135,94,47,125,175,245,108,153,62,182,187,252,56,247,90,139,158,66,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
