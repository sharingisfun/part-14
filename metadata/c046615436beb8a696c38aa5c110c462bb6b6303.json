The country veteran, 76, is bringing to an end a trilogy of albums about ageing that began with 2006s This Old Road. Produced like its predecessors by Don Was, it sets Kristoffersons sharp observations (Life is a song for the dying to sing) to grave yet graceful guitar, fiddle and harmonica melodies, ending with a jaunty tribute to another old-timer, Ramblin Jack Elliott.
