Scandal burst onto the scene in late 1982, when the video for their new wave song &quot;Goodbye To You&quot; was given very heavy rotation on MTV. In this song, Patty is the epitome of a 1980s cool new wave chick. It's a sassy kissoff song, full of life and energy. The lyrics may be somewhat cheesy, but Patty sings them with such seriousness and conviction that you just can't help but love her and the song.\n\nSoon afterwards, Scandal released the ballad &quot;Love's Got A Line On You.&quot; This song showed a very sensitive side to Patty, and her singing of the lyrics gave the song a very personal and intimate touch.\n\nLater on, Scandal scored their only top 40 hit with &quot;The Warrior.&quot; This is a song about female empowerment, and must have served as a good role model for young ladies all over the country.\n\nAround the same time, Scandal also released the song &quot;Hands Tied.&quot; This is a lovely ballad which is somewhat similar in tone to &quot;Love's Got A Line On You.&quot;\n\nScandal wanted to continue recording their own songs, but the record company kept trying to force them to cover other people's work. So the band broke up, and Patty went on to have a solo career.\n\nMy favorite solo song here is &quot;Heartache Heard Around The World.&quot; There's a certain sassiness and attitude in this song that reminds me of &quot;Goodbye To You.&quot; Clearly, Patty is a girl who can think for herself, and is very much in control of her life. I find this to be completely irresistible.\n\nMany of the solo songs here are ballads, and they are quite beautiful. &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,&quot; &quot;Wish I Were You,&quot; &quot;I Should Be Laughing,&quot; and &quot;Downtown Train&quot; are all standout tracks.\n\nOf all the different Patty Smyth/Scandal CDs, this one is my favorite.
