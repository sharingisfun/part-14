Tchad Blake brings his sonic excellence into the\nfold to handle mixing duties Muscle Shoals has produced iconic recordings from\nThe Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin, and Wilson Pickett, among many others\n\nCarney admits &quot;Brothers&quot; is the album they ve always wanted to make and taps\ninto their creative force as a duo. 'Dan and I grew up a lot as individuals and\nmusicians prior to making this album. Our relationship was tested in many ways\nbut at the end of the day, we re brothers, and I think these songs reflect\nthat'. The ghosts of Muscle Shoals inhabit &quot;Brothers&quot;' 15 tracks\n\nOf the album, Auerbach says, 'We like spooky sounds like Alice Coltrane, where\na dark groove is laid down. That s the headspace we tried to get into for this\nrecord'. The album includes the Danger Mouse-produced song &quot;Tighten Up&quot; and a\ncover of the Jerry Butler classic &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f39e187effbc6cf5b6f2752a272e4a326b47d96a","amp;dn":"The+Black+Keys+-Brothers+-%28Limited+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f39e187effbc6cf5b6f2752a272e4a326b47d96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,158,24,126,255,188,108,245,182,242,117,42,39,46,74,50,107,71,217,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
