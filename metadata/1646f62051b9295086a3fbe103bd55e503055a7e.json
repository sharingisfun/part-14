Massively outnumbered, the Carthaginians nevertheless won an astonishing victory - one that left more than 50,000 men dead.\nGregory Daly's enthralling study considers the reasons that led the two armies to the field of battle, and why each followed the course that they did when they got there. It explores in detail the composition of the armies, and the tactics and leadership methods of the opposing generals. Finally, by focusing on the experiences of those who fought, Daly gives an unparalleled portrait of the true horror and chaos of ancient warfare.\nThis striking and vivid account is the fullest yet of the bloodiest battle in ancient history.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Cannae-Experience-Battle-Second-Punic/dp/0415327431/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371673343&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cannae+experience&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Cannae-Experience-Battle-Second-Punic/dp/0415327431/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371673343&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cannae+experience&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1646f62051b9295086a3fbe103bd55e503055a7e","amp;dn":"Cannae%3A+The+Experience+of+Battle+in+the+Second+Punic+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1646f62051b9295086a3fbe103bd55e503055a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,70,246,32,81,185,41,80,134,163,251,225,3,189,85,229,3,5,90,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
