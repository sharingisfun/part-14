He walks the very streets where the murder took place and visits Oxford Castle, where some believe those accused of the murder were hanged. \n\nHe then takes a punt up the River Cam, where he is joined by members of the Cambridge Historical Society for a discussion about town and gown rivalry and also some of the amusing myths surrounding the university's foundation. \n\nFinally, David visits St Mary's Church, where Cambridge's new student body met for their first lectures and ceremonies. \n\n\nBroadcast on: BBC Radio 4, 10:30am Saturday 26th September 2009\nDuration: 30 minutes\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a92bf71b2e61dd6947b7659513d2e107a1edf3d8","amp;dn":"The+Oxbridge+Murder+%28BBC+Radio+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a92bf71b2e61dd6947b7659513d2e107a1edf3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,43,247,27,46,97,221,105,71,183,101,149,19,210,225,7,161,237,243,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
