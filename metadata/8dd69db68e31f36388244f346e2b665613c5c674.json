They decide Fort Benning will be their next destination. Along the way, they encounter a traffic jam of abandoned vehicles on I-85. The group loots several vehicles and as a large horde of walkers approaches, is forced to hide under the vehicles. Carol's daughter, Sophia, chased away from the highway by two of the remaining walkers, runs off into the woods. Carl is accidentally shot during a search for the missing girl, and Rick and the others take him to a large, isolated farm owned by a veterinarian named Hershel Greene and his family, who reluctantly removes the bullet from Carl. The remainder of Rick's group moves to the farm while Carl recovers. The group tries to co-exist alongside Hershel's family, but dangerous secrets and disagreements over leadership cause tensions to rise. Daryl leads the initiative to search for Sophia and becomes close to Carol as a result. Glenn builds a romantic relationship with Hershel's daughter Maggie and discovers that Hershel's barn is full of walkers, many of whom in life had been Hershel's friends and relatives; Hershel maintains that the infection that plagues the walkers is treatable and refuses to kill them. When Shane forces the walkers out of the barn, and the group opens fire, Sophia appears as one of the undead, and Rick shoots her","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd69db68e31f36388244f346e2b665613c5c674","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+-+SE+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd69db68e31f36388244f346e2b665613c5c674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,214,157,182,142,49,243,99,136,36,79,52,110,43,102,86,19,197,198,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
