The Masqueraders, Tony Clarke, and Steve Mancha are the most familiar artists, notwithstanding Rosey Grier, the football player turned actor turned reverend, who also sang a bit. Two tracks by Jackey Beavers, who began with Johnny Bristol as Johnny &amp; Jackie, are also on deck. If you like Detroit soul, you've probably been panting for this CD, but less devoted soul enthusiasts will not be especially excited by this.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.(I'll Be Your Champion) I'll Be Your Winner - Jimmy Soul Clark\n02.Not A Chance In A Million - Jock Mitchell\n03.How - Masqueraders\n04.Did My Baby Call - Steve Mancha\n05.I Need My Baby - Jackey Beavers\n06.Don't Turn Your Back On Me - Jack Montgomery\n07.Your Love Is Getting Stronger - Four Voices\n08.I'm Gonna Cry A River - Robert Ward &amp; Ohio Untouchables\n09.Crying Over You - Duke Browner\n10.I Am Nothing - Al Williams\n11.Why Weren't You There - Thelma Lindsay\n12.Keep Loving Me (Like You Do) - Silky Hargreaves\n13.Ain't Nothing You Can Do - Joe Matthews\n14.Nothing Sweeter (Than You Girl) - Eddie Hill\n15.Sweet Sweet Kisses - Larry Wright\n16.That's Alright - Ed Crook\n17.That's Why I Love You - The Professionals\n18.Love That Never Grows Old - Jackey Beavers\n19.(They Call Me) A Wrong Man - Tony Clarke\n20.Pizza Pie Man - Roosevelt Grier\n21.No More Heartaches - Art Posey\n22.You Can Lump It - Seminoles\n23.That's The Way He Is - Ann Perry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e7f7bfc01f6a6bd6e4595387dec851d228cc738","amp;dn":"VA+-+The+Essential+Detroit+Soul+Collection+%281992%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e7f7bfc01f6a6bd6e4595387dec851d228cc738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,127,123,252,1,246,166,189,110,69,149,56,125,236,133,29,34,140,199,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
