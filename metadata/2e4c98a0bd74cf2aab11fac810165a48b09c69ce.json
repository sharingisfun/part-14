Rage Against the Machine entered the popular lexicon as more than just a revolutionary American rock band, the group's very name provided a rallying battle cry for the ongoing struggles for liberation--psychic and political--on planet earth.\n\nFormed in 1991, Rage Against the Machine opened the gates of a new boundary-obliterating rock-rap musical alliance with the band's literate and politically-charged debut album. Featuring band members Tim Commerford, Zack de la Rocha, Tom Morello and Brad Wilk, Rage Against the Machine became a critical and commercial success, selling millions of copies around the world while attaining legendary status among alt-rock fans. To this day the album, and the band, remain standard-bearers for uncompromising incendiary rock.\n\nNewly remastered for this anniversary release, Rage Against the Machine - XX will be available as a CD in three configurations: 1) 20th Anniversary Edition Deluxe Box Set housing two CDs, two DVDs, one 12&quot; 180gm vinyl LP, one 40 page booklet and two-sided poster; 2) 20th Anniversary Special Edition featuring two CDs and a bonus DVD featuring six tracks in an oversized softpack and 3) 20th Anniversary Edition single compact disc (with three bonus tracks). 12&quot; 180gm vinyl editions--a picture disc and a facsimile reproduction--of the original LP, remastered (no bonus tracks) will also be available.\n\nCompact Disc One of the newly remastered Rage Against the Machine - XX will include the original album, in its entirety, as well as three collectible b-sides from era.\n\nCompact Disc Two presents the original Rage Against the Machine demo tape. Recorded in 1991 and sold for $5 at the merch table at early Rage shows, the tape achieved mythical word-of-mouth status amongst music fans while helping to seal the band's deal with Epic Records. The 20th anniversary releases of Rage Against the Machine - XX marks the first time the entire RATM demo tapes have seen a full official release.\n\nDVD #1 included in the Deluxe Box Set features Rage Against the Machine's historic free concert in Finsbury Park on June 2010, performed as a thank-you to UK fans for making &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; the UK's Number One Single during Christmas week 2009. Also included is the band's groundbreaking music videos plus live concert performance clips.\n\nDVD#2 takes you back to the release of Rage's debut album focusing on live performance from 1991-1994 which features the full set of RATM's first public performance as well as various live, rare clips.\n\nRage Against the Machine - XX will include new liner notes, penned especially for the band's 20th anniversary by longtime fan and hip-hop pioneer Chuck D.\n\n\nRage Against The Machine - XX (20th Anniversary Special Edition)\n\n\nCD 1 - Rage Against The Machine - Remastered\n\n01.
