Meshing snippets of dialogue with a diverse and powerful ...    Full Descriptionsoundtrack, PULP FICTION is dripping with the same seedy tension that characterizes Tarantino's films.\n\nThere are moments of elegance too. Al Green's luxurious &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; and Dusty Springfield's throaty &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; show that the heart of a romantic beats behind Tarantino's mischievous grin. A generous sampling of surf rock from the likes of Dick Dale &amp; his Del-Tones and the Tornadoes adds to the chaotic atmosphere of the three different stories within the film.\n\nThe soundtrack for PULP FICTION is another homage to Tarantino's great love affair with American rock. The tongue-in-cheek delivery of Neil Diamond's &quot;Girl You'll Be a Woman Soon,&quot; as done by Urge Overkill, brushes against the lonely-criminal sentiment of Ricky Nelson's gorgeous &quot;Lonesome Town.&quot; Tarantino is definitely hip, and PULP FICTION's soundtrack will make you respect his ear for detail even if you haven't seen the film.\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  VA        \nAlbum     -  Pulp Fiction Soundtrack                                           \nGenre     -  VA                                              \nLabel     -  MCA\nYear      -  1994                                            \nTracks    -  16                                               \nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  57.7 MB\nkbps      -  192\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt;  \n                                         \nI will seed my torrents for about one week.
