As uncompromising as ever, he found considerable difficulty securing backing for his ambitious projects. Unsure he would be able to film it, the director, an aspiring artist before he entered filmmaking, converted Kagemusha into a series of paintings, and it was partly on the basis of these that he won the financial support of longtime admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas. Set in the 16th century, when powerful warlords competed for control of Japan, it offers an examination of the nature of political power and the slipperiness of identity. For some time, Shingen Takeda (Tatsuya Nakadai) has been able to stay removed from the heat of battle by using his brother Nobukado (Tsutomu Yamazaki) as a double. As the film opens, Nobukado offers another option, having discovered a condemned thief (also played by Tatsuya Nakadai) bearing an uncanny resemblance to the warlord. After he insists on witnessing the fall of an enemy in person, Shingen falls victim to a sniper's bullet, forcing his advisers to present the thief as the fallen warrior. At first awkward in his new position and plagued by dreams in which the spirit of his double confronts him, he slowly grows into the role even as his enemies begin to advance on his kingdom. The winner of the Palm D'Or at Cannes, Kagemusha: The Shadow Warrior has also been released as The Double.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha001.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha001.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha002.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha002.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha003.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha003.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha004.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha004.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha005.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha005.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha007.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b28/ZenKoan/subalbum01/Kagemusha007.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----not my rip----\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 2,210,959,360 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 03:00:34 (259764 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 640x352 () [=] [=1.818]\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1434 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.265 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio 1 Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 124 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\n\nAudio 2 Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 61 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 42 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 2 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
