Known For Their Flamboyant Image, Matching Costumes And Heavily Choreographed Dance Routines, Five Star Achieved A String Of Top 40 Singles And Albums In The UK Between 1985 And 1988. \nFive Star's Greatest Hits Is A Compilation Album By The British Pop Group Released In 1989.  It Was The Group's First 'Greatest Hits' Collection After A Run Of Successful Singles And Albums Since 1985. Two New Songs Were Included On The Album, The First Of Which, &quot;With Every Heartbeat&quot;, Was Released As A Single. However, When It Failed To Make The Top 40, The Other New Track, &quot;Something About My Baby&quot;, Was Not Released As A Single.\n\nThe Release Of Greatest Hits Marked The End Of The Group's Association With RCA Records. However, The Album Proved To Be Five Star's Least Successful Release Up To That Point, Selling Only 5,500 Copies And Peaking At A Lowly #53 On The UK Charts, Highlighting The Band's Rapid Decline In Popularity.\n\nAfter The Album's Release, The Group Signed To Epic Records, And Immediately Began Planning A New Album For The Following Year, The Self Titled &quot;Five Star&quot; Album. However, This New Album Would Not See British Release.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Can't Wait Another Minute\n[02] Whenever You're Ready\n[03] Rain Or Shine\n[04] Find The Time\n[05] System Addict\n[06] Stay Out Of My Life\n[07] Let Me Be The One\n[08] Rock My World\n[09] With Every Heartbeat\n[10] The Slightest Touch\n[11] All Fall Down\n[12] If I Say Yes\n[13] Somewhere Somebody\n[14] R.S.V.P.\n[15] Strong As Steel\n[16] Love Take Over\n[17] Another Weekend\n[18] Something About My Baby\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t\t- 01h:11m:40s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t\t- 173mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t\t- I-Tunes MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t\t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t\t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t\t- only1joe\n\nUpload Speed\t\t\t- 33-35kbs\n\nMusic Genre\t\t\t- R&amp;B Pop\n\nRelease Date\t\t\t- 15 October 1989\n\nRecord Company\t\t\t- RCA BMG\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t\t- http://www.fivestarofficial.com \n\t\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c92064d1bb1f8b22c68520a4f9258a750e4858","amp;dn":"%5B1989%5D+Greatest+Hits+-+Five+Star+-+173mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c92064d1bb1f8b22c68520a4f9258a750e4858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,201,32,100,209,187,31,139,34,198,133,32,164,249,37,138,117,14,72,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
