Speedwagon) is an American rock band. Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. Hi Infidelity (1980) contained four US Top 40 hits and is the group's best-selling album, with over ten million copies sold.\n\nOver the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted thirteen Top 40 hits, including the number ones &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; and &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot;. REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity dissipated in the 1990s but the band remains a popular live act.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGood Trouble is the tenth studio album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1982 as a follow-up to Hi Infidelity. It was the second-best selling album in the band's history, subsequently tied with Wheels Are Turnin', peaking at #7 on the Billboard charts. The single &quot;Keep the Fire Burnin'&quot; gave the band a #7 hit on Billboard's Pop Singles Chart and a #2 hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, their highest-charting hit on this chart.\n\nNone of the songs from this album have been performed by the band in concert since 1983 except &quot;Keep The Fire Burnin',&quot; which was played as an acoustic version in their two shows at Valencia, Venezuela during the &quot;Live As We Know It Tour '87,&quot; and has been played occasionally in more recent years.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREO Speedwagon:\n\nKevin Cronin: acoustic guitar, piano, rhythm guitar, vocals\n\nGary Richrath: lead guitar\n\nNeal Doughty: organ, synthesizer, piano, Hammond organ\n\nBruce Hall: bass guitar, lead vocals on &quot;Let's Be-Bop&quot; and first verse of &quot;Girl With the Heart of Gold&quot;\n\nAlan Gratzer: drums, tambourine, background vocals\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Musicians:\n\n\nSteve Forman: Percussion, Chimes, Shaker, Crotales\n\nRichard Page: Backing vocals\n\nTom Kelly: Backing vocals\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSingle Chart Position:\n \n1982:\n\n\n&quot;Keep The Fire Burnin&quot; Billboard Hot 100 7 \nMainstream Rock Chart 2 \n\n&quot;Sweet Time&quot; Billboard Hot 100 26\n \n&quot;The Key&quot; Mainstream Rock Chart 34 \n\n&quot;Stillness of the Night&quot; Mainstream Rock Chart 19 \n\n&quot;Good Trouble&quot; Mainstream Rock Chart 51 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3982485c22593a88daa9210cd222e6d7fac26c0b","amp;dn":"REO+Speedwagon+-+Good+Trouble+%5B1982%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3982485c22593a88daa9210cd222e6d7fac26c0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,130,72,92,34,89,58,136,218,169,33,12,210,34,230,215,250,194,108,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
