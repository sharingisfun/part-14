Since Sam Merlotte is now known to be two-natured, suspicion falls immediately on the anti-shifters in the area. But Sookie suspects otherwise and she and Sam work together to uncover the culprit - and the twisted motive for the attack. But her attention is divided. Though she can't 'read' vampires, Sookie knows her lover Eric Northman and his 'child' Pam well - and she realises that they are plotting to kill the vampire who is now their master. Gradually, she is drawn into the plot -which is much more complicated than she knows. Caught up in the politics of the vampire world, Sookie will learn that she is as much of a pawn as any ordinary human - and that there is a new Queen on the board.\nUnabridged.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n\n------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a7f90bb4a50af7170f6b23e637ea998f252957","amp;dn":"Dead+Reckoning+-+Charlaine+Harris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a7f90bb4a50af7170f6b23e637ea998f252957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,167,249,11,180,165,10,247,23,15,107,35,230,55,234,153,143,37,41,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
