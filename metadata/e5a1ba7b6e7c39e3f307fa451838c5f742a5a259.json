Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans.\n\nFlash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren Jaegar (YÃƒÂ»ki Kaji) and his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman (Yui Ishikawa) witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5a1ba7b6e7c39e3f307fa451838c5f742a5a259","amp;dn":"Attack.On.Titan.S01E01-S01E23.EngSub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5a1ba7b6e7c39e3f307fa451838c5f742a5a259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,161,186,123,110,124,57,227,243,7,250,69,24,56,197,247,66,165,162,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
