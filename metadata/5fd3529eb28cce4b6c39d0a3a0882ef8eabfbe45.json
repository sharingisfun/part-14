It was released on Signature Sound Recordings and produced by David Goodrich\n\nFour decades of music mastery and songwriting craft come together on Chris Smither's latest collection, Time Stands Still -- a gripping mix of originals and potent covers. The new collection puts the exclamation point on a legendary career that shows no signs of slowing down. On the contrary, this blues and folk superstar continues to build creative momentum. His latest effort features a slew of tunes stripped down to their essence, shining the spotlight on Smither's understated power as a songwriter--one who taps into emotions at their most elemental and powerful core. It's a reminder why artists as diverse as Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris and Diana Krall have mined Smither's catalog in the past. He's teamed with producer and guitarist David &quot;Goody&quot; Goodrich and drummer Zak Trojano to create a simple, yet emotionally powerful musical landscape upon which to paint his blues and folk-fueled narra- tives. As always, Smither's signature finger-picking style mixes with his whiskey-meets-honey vocals to deliver intensely honest meditations on life, love and loss. Smither's 11th studio album was recorded in just three days and captures the vibrant urgency and immediacy of his live shows. It features eight original compositions as well as covers from Bob Dylan, Mark Knopfler, and 1920s country-blues songster Frank Hutchison. \n\nAudio CD (September 29, 2009) \nOriginal Release Date: September 29, 2009 \nNumber of Discs: 1 \nLabel: Signature Sounds \nASIN: B002IVLWF6 \n\nAll songs by Chris Smither unless otherwise noted.\n\n&quot;Don't Call Me Stranger&quot; - 4:08 \n&quot;Time Stands Still&quot; - 3:45 \n&quot;Surprise, Surprise&quot; - 4:08 \n&quot;I Don't Know&quot; - 4:04 \n&quot;Call Yourself&quot; - 4:43 \n&quot;Old Man Down&quot; - 5:00 \n&quot;I Told You So&quot; - 3:46 \n&quot;It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&quot; (Bob Dylan) - 4:26 \n&quot;Miner's Blues&quot; (Frank Hutchinson) - 3:08 \n&quot;Someone Like Me&quot; - 4:25 \n&quot;Madame Geneva's&quot; (Mark Knopfler) - 2:51 \n[edit] Personnel\nChris Smither ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, acoustic guitar \nDavid Goodrich - electric and acoustic guitar, piano \nZak Trojano - percussion \n\n Production\nProduced by David Goodrich \nMixed by Mark Thayer and David Goodrich \nMastered by Ian Kennedy \nProject coordination by Carol Young \nDesign by Meghan Dewar \nPhotography by Jeff Fasano \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd3529eb28cce4b6c39d0a3a0882ef8eabfbe45","amp;dn":"Chris+Smither...Time+Stands+Still%282009%29%5BFLAC%5Dl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd3529eb28cce4b6c39d0a3a0882ef8eabfbe45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,211,82,158,178,140,206,75,108,57,208,163,160,136,46,248,234,191,190,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
