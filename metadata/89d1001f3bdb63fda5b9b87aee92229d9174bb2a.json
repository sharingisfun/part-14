Since I was only 11 years old when Clifford tragically died in 1956, I knew very little about him.  I picked up this CD based on what I'd read about him, and was blown away.  He was without a doubt one of the greatest trumpeters in history.  His technique, imagination and his heartfelt playing can exhilarate and also put a lump in your throat.  I've purchased three other CD's of him since then, but this one still remains my favorite.  I love Gertrude's Bounce, Joy Spring, Jordu, Cherokee, well actually the sound of his poignant playing insures you that there really is no such thing as a bad Clifford Brown cut.  If you're new to jazz or want to get a wonderful example of this great master's work, you can't go wrong with this one.  One of my top 10 jazz CD's of all time.  ~ Robert G.  Martinez\n\nClifford Brown was a brilliant young trumpeter, a genius many think was on the level of Miles Davis, who tragically died at a young age.  Playing here in his mid-twenties between 1954-57, he records with drummer Max Roach, making classic and timeless tracks.  You'll find wonderful bonuses like Sonny Rollins on two tracks, Richie Powell, who's Bud's brother, on piano, and even a lush and gorgeous vocal by Helen Merrill on &quot;What's New. &quot; This is gorgeous, gorgeous music.  Sit and listen to its depth and beauty, or put it on at dinner for a rich and rewarding ambience.  Above all, soak up the Gabriel-like beauty of Clifford Brown on his golden horn.  ~ Tom B.  &quot;handydandy&quot;\n\nMax Roach&amp; Clifford Brown - this colloboration may have been one of the best in Jazz history.  This music is hot.  I have never heard a better Max.   Magic.  I wonder what would have happened if Clifford &amp; Max would have had the chance to record some ore.  They would have set Jazz milestones.
