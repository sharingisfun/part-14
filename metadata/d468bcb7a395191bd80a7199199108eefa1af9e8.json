There are four chapters of characters who have committed all kinds of unforgivable deeds. The first chapter, Scary Families, has creepy relatives who definitely believe that blood is thicker than water, such as the Queen of the Vampires, complete with felt crown and lace detailing. In Famous Scaries, meet classic characters like the Headless Horseman, who has crocheted blood spurting from his neck, and his horse Hades, made in jet-black yarn. The Living Dead is a macabre mix of werewolves, witches and the clinically insane, while the Deathly Companions chapter has murderous villains and even a shrunken head. As well as crocheting your own cast of scary characters, you will find patterns for accessories including the spider bag complete with eight legs. At the back of the book is a comprehensive techniques section explaining all you need to know, which makes the projects suitable for any skill level.
