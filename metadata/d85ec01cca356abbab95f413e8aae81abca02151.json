Jens Gad's Enigmatic Obsession\n\n\nAnd, by my research, an explanation of the &quot;Mystic Mixes&quot; releases.\n\n*Note 1: As noted, this is actually a fake Enigma album, the 1st 2 songs are Enigma, and that's why they are included here, but the remainder of the album was other artists that sounded similar, or intentionally trying to copy Enigma.\n\n**Note2: Part of the&quot;15 Years After&quot; Box Set, but I listed it as it's own album. 15YA is just a bundle of all albums released to that date, also contains 2 DVDs of all videos to that date.\n\n***Note3: Razormaid, a DJ company remixes popular songs into thier own versions, and they are usually very hard to find in a torrent. Was also difficult to find the correct Album Art.\n\nAs always, my discog's have 100% completed ID3s, and 500x500 album art.\nENJOY again. \nHMD3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d85ec01cca356abbab95f413e8aae81abca02151","amp;dn":"Enigma+Full+Discog+%5BHMD3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d85ec01cca356abbab95f413e8aae81abca02151","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,94,192,28,202,53,106,187,171,149,244,19,232,170,232,26,188,160,33,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
