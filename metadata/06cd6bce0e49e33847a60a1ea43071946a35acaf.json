Born in 1935, Saluzzi has had a wide variety of musical experience in various genres such as folk, jazz and tango, but his own very individual music defies easy classification, definitely haunted by the wistful soul of tango but perhaps reaching a little further, toward Argentina's native heritage, alloying the sense of longing and nostalgia with exquisite delicacy and understatement.\n\nThis collection is the result of several years of interaction between Saluzzi and the members of the Rosamunde Quartet of Munich, which explains why the German musicians seem so finely attuned to the composer's quiet yet commanding voice.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Cruz del Sur\n02 - Salon de tango\n03 - ...y se encamino hacia el destierro\n04 - ...y solos - bajo una luna amarilla\n05 - Milonga de los morenos\n06 - Miserere\n07 - El apriete\n08 - Recitativo final\n\n*1998 ECM Records | ECM 1638 | ECM New Series\n \n\n\nPersonnel:\nDino Saluzzi - bandoneÃƒÂ³n\nAndreas Reiner - violin\nSimon Fordham - violin\nHelmut Nicolai - viola\nAnja Lechner - cello\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06cd6bce0e49e33847a60a1ea43071946a35acaf","amp;dn":"Dino+Saluzzi+%26amp%3B+Rosamunde+Quartett+-+Kultrum+%281998%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06cd6bce0e49e33847a60a1ea43071946a35acaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,205,107,206,14,73,227,56,71,166,10,30,164,48,113,148,106,53,172,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
