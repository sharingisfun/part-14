This is a docudrama about an orphanage which made a great noise about how charitable it was, while horrible things were happening behind its doors. The infants were given butter crates instead of cradles, quite a number were also buried thus. Instead of tut-tutting about the past, we should ask ourselves how many more abuses are going on behind our backs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9b6c763e820f3da5d32a2c4ce5a37087fcad4d","amp;dn":"Butterbox+Babies+%281995%29+Nicholas+Campbell+-+infant+abuse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9b6c763e820f3da5d32a2c4ce5a37087fcad4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,155,108,118,62,130,15,61,165,211,42,44,76,229,163,112,135,252,173,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
