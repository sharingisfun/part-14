Having lived under Middle East dictatorships, Edmonds knows firsthand what can happen when government is allowed to operate in secret. Hers is a sobering perspective that combines painful experience with a rallying cry for the publicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to know and to hold the lawbreakers accountable. With U.S. citizens increasingly stripped of their rights in a calibrated media blackout, EdmondsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ story is a wake-up call for all Americans who, willingly or unwillingly, traded liberty for illusive security in the wake of 9/11.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Sibel Edmonds is the editor of Boiling Frogs Post and the founder- director of National Security Whistleblowers Coalition. She is the recipient of the 2006 PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award. Ms. Edmonds worked as a language specialist for the FBI where she reported serious acts of security breaches and cover-ups, and for that she was retaliated against and ultimately fired. The court proceedings on her case were blocked by the assertion of State Secrets Privilege, and the U.S. Congress has been gagged and prevented from taking up or even discussing her case through retroactive classification issued by the Department of Justice. Ms. Edmonds has a MA in Public Policy from George Mason University, and a BA in Criminal Justice and Psychology from George Washington University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1ec497d212886391f0de3144a98a17bf42c8200","amp;dn":"Classified+Woman+-+Sibel+Edmonds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1ec497d212886391f0de3144a98a17bf42c8200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,236,73,125,33,40,134,57,31,13,227,20,74,152,161,123,244,44,130,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
