In the evolution of man, when did we first start having contact with alien beings and if we share DNA how does that fit in the theory of evolution? If a woman has an abortion is she ruining against the natural unfoldment of an expression of the universe? On Essassani,  do you use a technological, electronic music or is it all acoustical style? Do you use crystals as a musical instrument?  What do repeated numbers in my reality mean?  Bashar speaks on &quot;The Limbo State&quot;  Do I have an Essassani counter part and how can I connect with that counter part?  The Dolphin/Siruis connection.  A 2012 mid-year check-in.
