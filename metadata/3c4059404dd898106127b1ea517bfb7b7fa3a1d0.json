Both may be best for the hardcore Superman fan.\nSuperman: Godfall was a 2000s story arc in the comics featuring Superman in adventures through the bottle city of Kandor.\n\nThe story revolved around an amnesiac Superman living with his wife, Lyla, in Kandor. The story updated Kandor and gave Superman a variant costume, as well as introducing a new Kryptonian villain, Preus. \n\n\nRuin, an enigmatic figure in a mask and a trenchcoat, first appeared when he took over STAR Labs and held Superman at bay with Xlim, who he tortured into helping enact his plans.\n\nObsessed with how he believes Superman will eventually destroy the Earth, Ruin is merciless in his attempts to hound Superman using technology and raw power. He has many technological tools at his disposal, and was shown working at the behest of a Lex Luthor in hiding.\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c4059404dd898106127b1ea517bfb7b7fa3a1d0","amp;dn":"Superman+-+Godfall+%26amp%3B+Ruin+Saga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c4059404dd898106127b1ea517bfb7b7fa3a1d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,64,89,64,77,216,152,16,97,39,177,234,81,123,251,123,127,163,161,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
