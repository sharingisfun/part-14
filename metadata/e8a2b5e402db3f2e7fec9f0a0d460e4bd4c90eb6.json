This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey tells how Mick Fleetwood, and John &amp; Christine McVie happened to add Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham to their group Fleetwood Mac. Their song &quot;Think About Me&quot; is at number 37.\n\nActress Bernadette Peters debuts her song &quot;Gee Whiz&quot; at number 35.\n\nTwo listeners ask if any songs sung entirely in a foreign language have ever hit the top 40. Casey lists three that climbed all the way to number one: one in French, one in Italian, and one in Japanese.\n\nPaul McCartney is at number 27 with &quot;Coming Up.&quot; Casey plays the album version (the A-side), instead of the live version (the B-side).\n\nBob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band debut at number 26 with their song &quot;Against The Wind&quot; putting two songs in the countdown. The other is &quot;Fire Lake&quot; at number 6.\n\nCasey says the staff at AT40 recently noticed a trend in disco hits versus ballads. So they asked the opinion of song writer/producer Freddie Perren (responsible for hits by the Sylvers, Peaches &amp; Herb, and Gloria Gaynor). Casey reports his view of why disco is out and slow songs are back.\n\nLW#3: Lost In Love - Air Supply\nLW#2: Ride Like The Wind - Christopher Cross\nLW#1: Call Me - Blondie\n40:    Should've Never Let You Go - Neil Sedaka &amp; Dara Sedaka\n39:    Headed For A Fall - Firefall\n38:    Little Jeannie - Elton John        \n37:    Think About Me - Fleetwood Mac     \n36:    Starting Over Again - Dolly Parton     \n35:    Gee Whiz - Bernadette Peters    \n34:    Wondering Where The Lions Are - Bruce Cockburn\n33:    Let Me Be The Clock - Smokey Robinson\nARCHIVE: What A Fool Believes - The Doobie Brothers\n32:    Let's Get Serious - Jermaine Jackson\n31:    The Seduction - The James Last Band\n30:    She's Out Of My Life - Michael Jackson\n29:    Working My Way Back To You/Forgive Me Girl - The Spinners     \n28:    Train In Vain - The Clash\n27:    Coming Up - Paul McCartney\nLDD: Wildflower - Skylark\n26:    Against The Wind - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band\n25:    Heart Hotels - Dan Fogelberg\n24:    Do Right - Paul Davis\n23:    Steal Away - Robbie Dupree\nARCHIVE: Knock On Wood - Amii Stewart\n22:    The Rose - Bette Midler\n21:    Special Lady - Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown\n20:    Brass In Pocket - The Pretenders\n19:    Funky Town - Lipps, Inc.\n18:    Stomp - The Brothers Johnson\n17:    Breakdown Dead Ahead - Boz Scaggs\n16:    I Can't Tell You Why - The Eagles\n15:    Cars - Gary Numan\n14:    I Can't Help It - Andy Gibb &amp; Olivia Newton-John\n13:    Pilot Of The Airwaves - Charlie Dore\n12:    Hurt So Bad - Linda Ronstadt\nARCHIVE: Heart Of Glass - Blondie\n11:    Biggest Part Of Me - Ambrosia\n10:    Hold On To My Love - Jimmy Ruffin\n9:    Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer - Kenny Rogers w/ Kim Carnes\n8:    Sexy Eyes - Dr. Hook\nLDD: I Do Love You - G.Q.    \n7:    You May Be Right - Billy Joel\n6:    Fire Lake - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band\n5:    Another Brick In The Wall - Pink Floyd\n4:    With You I'm Born Again - Billy Preston &amp; Syreeta\n3:    Lost In Love - Air Supply\n2:    Ride Like The Wind - Christopher Cross\n1:    Call Me - Blondie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a2b5e402db3f2e7fec9f0a0d460e4bd4c90eb6","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1980_May_10th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a2b5e402db3f2e7fec9f0a0d460e4bd4c90eb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,162,181,228,2,219,63,46,127,236,159,10,13,70,14,75,212,201,14,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
