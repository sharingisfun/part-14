Pei and Salvotore Ramondino\n\n\n# of pages: 1234\n\n\n\nDescription (from Preface):\n\n\nAmerican bilingual lexicography is gradually pulling itself\naway from its traditional dependence upon Britain. While it\nis still fairly common practice for American publishing houses\nto reprint British works when dealing with the old cultural\nlanguages, with or without revision and adaptation to Ameri-\ncan use, Americans are beginning, particularly for those new\nlanguages whose study has become widespread within the last\nhalf-century (notably Spanish and Russian), to strike out for\nthemselves and offer works that reflect not merely present\ncolloquial usage in both English and foreign language, but\nalso the specific usage of the United States and of that foreign-\nlanguage area with which they are in closest contact.\n\nThe present work has been under way for the better part of\nten years. It embodies the most recent methodological findings\nof linguistic science. combined with the highest utilitarian 3\nprinciples. It contains an estimated 70,000 entries, more than\nany comparable dictionary. There is a built-in principle of I\nselective labeling of meanings that removes all doubt as to\nwhich one of various possible Spanish equivalents best fits the\nmeaning of an English word in a given context. Full pronun-\nciation, in International Phonetic Alphabet transcription, is 1\ngiven for all words in both languages. Prefixes and suffixes are\nfully defined in the text. Idiomatic phrases and expressions\nare likewise included in the text, and listed under the key 3\nword with their exact and usable equivalents on the same\nlevel of diction. The typography is designed to help, not to\nhinder, the reader. A separate condensation of grammar and\nirregularities does not always overcome the stumbling block\nof inflectional forms that deviate from the normal pattern.\nHence the reader will welcome the appearance of irregular\nforms in the text itself, providing immediate guidance in their\nrecognition and use.\n\nCompleteness in lexicography is only an ideal. Even if it\nwere possible to attain, it would disappear within days or\neven hours, since innovations are continually being made in\nall living languages. More desirable and attainable are the\nqualities of selectivity, adequacy, and accuracy. These have\nbeen the constant preoccupation of the Editorial Board. In\nwhat measure they have been achieved will, in the final analy-\nsis, be determined solely by the reader and user. This volume\nis offered in the hope that the verdict may be favorable.\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n1.PDF is B/W","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:015280b45954ebed8dcd0fe04be88e763e257863","amp;dn":"The+New+World+Spanish-English+and+English-Spanish+Dictionary+%2819","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"015280b45954ebed8dcd0fe04be88e763e257863","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,82,128,180,89,84,235,237,141,205,15,224,75,232,142,118,62,37,120,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
