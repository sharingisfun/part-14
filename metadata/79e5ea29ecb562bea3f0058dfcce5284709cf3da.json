The author determines there is something more systematic about the way people behave irrationally, especially during economic crises, and this behavior can be measured and incorporated into economic forecasting and setting economic policy. GreenspanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s considerations include behavioral imperatives (fear, optimism, etc.) and their role in rational economic behavior and market outcomes; bubbles and their differences; and the roots of the crisis in securitized U.S. subprime mortgages.

This challenging, thought-provoking book sheds an important perspective on events that triggered possibly the greatest financial crisis ever. --Mary Whaley\nReview\nLarry Summers, Financial Times:\n&quot;No other American economic policy maker in the past half-century could have written so thoughtfully about the implications of the Enlightenment for economic policy or have attempted, as Greenspan did while in office and does again here, to compute the physical weight of all the goods that comprise American gross domestic product.
