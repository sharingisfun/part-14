Their young trumpet-player, Hieronymus Falk, declared a musical genius by none other than Louis Armstrong, is arrested in a Paris cafÃƒÂ©. He is never heard from again. He was 20 years old, a German citizen. And he was black. Berlin, 1952. Falk is a jazz legend. Hot Time Swingers band members Sid Griffiths and Chip Jones, both African Americans from Baltimore, have appeared in a documentary about Falk. When they are invited to attend the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier, SidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in FalkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate will be questioned and the two old musicians set off on a surprising and strange journey. From the smoky bars of pre-war Berlin to the salons of Paris, Sid leads the listener through a fascinating, little-known world as he describes the friendships, love affairs, and treacheries that led to FalkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incarceration in Sachsenhausen.\n Half-Blood Blues is a story about music and race, love and loyalty, and the sacrifices we ask of ourselves, and demand of others, in the name of art.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66eefb1ef0e2b5edbeff787361088c8e2ec9645a","amp;dn":"Esi+Edugyan+-+Half-Blood+Blues+%28audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66eefb1ef0e2b5edbeff787361088c8e2ec9645a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,238,251,30,240,226,181,237,190,255,120,115,97,8,140,142,46,201,100,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
