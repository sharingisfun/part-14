It was directed and choreographed in the flamenco style. It is the first part of Saura's 1980s flamenco trilogy, and is followed by Carmen (1983) and El amor brujo (1986).\nThe film depicts Antonio Gades and his dance company performing a flamenco adaptation of Federico GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a Lorca's play Blood Wedding. As with all Saura's flamenco films, the film is overtly theatrical: it begins with the company arriving at the studio and putting on costumes and makeup. The dance is then performed in a bare windowed space with a minimum of props and no set. There are no elaborate costumes and many of the actors wear only their rehearsal clothes.\nIt was shown out of competition at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.\nCast\nAntonio Gades as Leonardo\nCristina Hoyos as Bride\nJuan Antonio JimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nez as Groom\nPilar CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rdenas as Mother\nCarmen Villena as Wife\n\nAVI 720x544 \n01H08M\nAC3-320Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01163bc57a6fa9af9392d1ccc21316002c2af6e","amp;dn":"Bodas+de+Sangre+-+Carlos+Saura+%281981%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01163bc57a6fa9af9392d1ccc21316002c2af6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,17,99,188,87,166,250,154,249,57,45,28,204,33,49,96,2,194,175,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
