Retired spymaster George Smiley (Alec Guinness) wanders around Europe and visits a succession of desperate or eccentric characters as he plays a game which finally leads to another confrontation with and a possible victory over his Moriarty-like Soviet arch-nemesis Karla (an expressive but silent Patrick Stewart).\n\nDirected by Simon Langton and coscripted by John Hopkins and Le CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© himself, this is a leisurely mystery. It offers a cannily generous central performance from Guinness, who never takes off his scarf and does his best to fade into the background while a succession of striking character players hold center screen; but slowly and by sheer presence he begins to dominate the panoramic view of European treachery, deception, and disappointment. Among the terrific supporting cast are Michel Lonsdale, Mario Adorf, Vladek Sheybal, Michael Gough, Alan Rickman (a tiny, early role as a hotel clerk), Beryl Reid, Ingrid Pitt, Bernard Hepton, Michael Elphick, Rosalie Crutchley, Michael Byrne, Bill Paterson, and Maureen Lipman. Smiley's People is more interested in character than thrills, with each cameo contributing another view of the human cost of the cold war: most of the old friends Smiley seeks out react to his reappearance by saying they never wanted to see him again, and victory is only possible because Smiley discovers that his opposite number has a weakness that makes him almost sympathetic. It was originally broadcast in six hourlong episodes, and its intelligent approach works better if you watch episode-length chunks, letting one sink in before going on. --Kim Newman\n\nProduct Description\nThe thrilling sequel to Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\nBoth had supposedly outlived their usefulness to the Circus, the British Secret Intelligence Service: George Smiley, the retired head of espionage, and General Vladimir, an aging informant who reported to him. When the general walks into a bullet after sending an urgent message to his old handler, the Circus asks Smiley to &quot;tidy things up.&quot; But Smiley hears VladimirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s message as a call to arms against his nemesis, the Soviet super spy Karla, once again tantalizingly within his grasp.\n\nAlec Guiness reprises the role of British spymaster George Smiley in this gripping sequel to the television masterpiece Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Filmed on location in London, Paris, Hamburg and Berne, SmileyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s People also stars Eileen Atkins, Anthony Bate, Bernard Hepton, Michael Lonsdale, Beryl Reid, Patrick Stewart and Bill Patterson.\nDVD Special Features Include: digitally remastered presentation, exclusive interview with John le CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, production notes, cast filmographies, le CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© biography and booklist, full-color insert with glossary of characters and terms. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a7224a6dda48133a9357045b853393e0e844f11","amp;dn":"LeCarre+-+BBC+miniseries+-+Smiley%5C%27s+People+%286+episodes+-+AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a7224a6dda48133a9357045b853393e0e844f11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,114,36,166,221,164,129,51,169,53,112,69,184,83,57,62,14,132,79,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
