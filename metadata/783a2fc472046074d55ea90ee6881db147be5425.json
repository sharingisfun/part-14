Both releases mix new holiday material with covers of classic Christmas tunes, and while it is obviously difficult to creatively come up with anything particularly startling on these kinds of seasonal releases, Reba at least manages to keep it all pleasant and interesting. Highlights include &quot;This Is My Prayer for You,&quot; the fun, rocking &quot;Up on the Housetop,&quot; a stately version of &quot;Away in a Manger,&quot; a cover of Grandpa Jones' over-the-top heart-tugger &quot;The Christmas Guest,&quot; and a wonderful revitalization of &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas,&quot; which is the real gem here.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:783a2fc472046074d55ea90ee6881db147be5425","amp;dn":"Reba+McEntire+-+Christmas+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"783a2fc472046074d55ea90ee6881db147be5425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,58,47,196,114,4,96,116,213,94,169,14,230,136,29,177,71,190,84,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
