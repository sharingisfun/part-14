A built-in texture pack is provided for those without root.\n\n[img]http://s28.postimg.org/6xw19b7h9/unnamed2.png[/img]\n\nON JELLY BEAN, THIS APPLICATION CANNOT USE ORIGINAL MINECRAFT TEXTURES WITHOUT ROOT ACCESS! A built-in texture pack is provided for those without root.\n\nBlockLauncher Pro is a custom Minecraft Pocket Edition launcher that wraps around Minecraft PE and provides loading of patches, texture packs, and server IPs.\n(formerly known as MCPELauncher)\n\nTHIS APPLICATION MAY NOT WORK ON ALL DEVICES! Please try the free version before buying this version to make sure that the app is compatible.\n\nJust choose Options on the main screen, then select mods. It is that easy!\n\nThis program loads libminecraftpe.so from the currently installed copy of Minecraft PE, so it should be compatiable with the mod patching features of PocketTool and QuickPatch.\n\nJelly Bean users: currently, this application cannot load original textures from copies of Minecraft installed by Google Play on Android 4.1 and above. The built-in texture pack will be used if no texture pack is selected.\n\nFeatures:\n- Patch an unlimited number of PTPatches and ModPE scripts\n- Load textures from any Pocket Edition-compatiable texture pack\n- Patch server IPs\n\nRecent changes:\nSupport for Minecraft PE 0.8.1\nAdded new translations by PEMapModder, KMCPE, and GamerEnderman\nRe-enabled entity event API\nnew text input system\nKnown issues:\n- custom items' textures are now specified in a new format. Thus, most existing custom items will have blank textures.\n- custom blocks are not currently supported. Any existing custom blocks will turn into UPDATE blocks.\n- the built-in texture pack is missing some textures\n- Hitting Enter on create world screen fails; tap on screen instead \n\n[b]http://postimg.org/image/fhff72ftl/[/b]\n\n[img]http://s28.postimg.org/vfo4x7a1p/unnamed.png[/img]\n\nFor More info :- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zhuoweizhang.mcpelauncher.pro\n\n[img]http://s22.postimg.org/bhay4358x/thanks.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://i.cubeupload.com/x83wjq.gif[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://s28.postimg.org/timog9sil/cooltext1344496247.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a76b38d41e5799510da339866053a9599b965364","amp;dn":"BlockLauncher+Pro+v1.6.3+%5BANDROID%5D%7Bshilpa143%7D+-%3D%5BTeam+OS%5D%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a76b38d41e5799510da339866053a9599b965364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,107,56,212,30,87,153,81,13,163,57,134,96,83,169,89,155,150,83,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
