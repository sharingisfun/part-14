But something            \n           doesn't feel right. Suddenly, in the midst of bursting         \n           paint pellets, one of the players is hit by a real bullet.     \n           Confusion reigns until they realise that this is no longer     \n           a game, it is a manhunt. One by one they fall into the         \n           traps set by an invisible enemy. Their only chance of          \n           survival is to fight with whatever means necessary.            \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                  Thanks to our friends at KART3LDVD.
