Liner Note Authors: Bob Blumenthal; Ira Gitler. Recording information: Van Gelder Studios, Englewood, NJ (07/15/1958); Van Gelder Studios, Englewood, NJ (06/16/1959). Smith's superb keyboard technique is only half of his musical magic. The other is his astonishing ability to paint atmospheres and create exquisite moods. The feeling of this album is perfectly evinced, relaxed and cool, spacious yet textured and sophisticated enough to keep the ear consistently intrigued. The album's title and cover photo are an homage to a soul food diner in Harlem called Kate's Home Cooking, and the tunes parallel a range of subtle, carefully prepared flavors. Traditional slow and mid-tempo blues predominate, such as &quot;See See Rider&quot; and &quot;Come On Baby,&quot; kept fresh though Percy France's Lester Young-influenced playing, Kenny Burrell's clean guitar lines and Smith's deeply soulful leads. The sly riffing on &quot;Gracie&quot; and the jazz thematics of &quot;Apostrophe&quot; are also highlights. HOME COOKIN' offers the perfect blend of style and substance, of traditional soul and modern cool (not to mention five bonus tracks unissued on the original LP) in a mix that's tasty and utterly satisfying.\n\n\nArtist Overview \nThough he was a late bloomer (he didn't start playing organ until age 28), Jimmy Smith is the single most influential figure in the history of jazz organ. He was the pioneering force in making the organ a lead instrument. And while he had bebop chops aplenty, his blues/R&amp;B influences and preference for space over clutter also made him an icon of the subsequent acid jazz movement. \nRelated \n\n\nOther Albums by this Artist:  \nPrayer Meetin' [Remaster]   Rockin' The Boat [Remaster]   Back At The Chicken Shack   The Sermon [Remaster]   The Boss [9/14]    House Party [Remaster]   Angel Eyes: Ballads &amp; Slow Jams   Cool Blues [Remaster]   The Definitive Jimmy Smith   Crazy Baby   Open House/Plain Talk   Groovin' At Small's Paradise [Remaster]   Jazz Masters 29   Jimmy Smith's Finest Hour   Six Views Of The Blues [Limited]   Ultimate Jimmy Smith   Best Of The Blue Note Years   Midnight Special   Any Number Can Win   Root Down [Remaster]   Talkin' Verve: Roots Of Acid Jazz   Bashin' - The Unpredictable Jimmy Smith   Fourmost   Organ Grinder Swing [Remaster]   Standards   Off The Top   Sum Serious Blues   Damn!
