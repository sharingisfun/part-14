ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Humanity,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an evil-butcher horror story that ends pretty much like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect any evil-butcher horror story to end. Presenting the classic EC material in reader-friendly, artist-and-genre-centric packages for the first time, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Taint the Meat collects every one of DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 24 Crypt stories in one convenient, gore-drenched package. Mostly written by EC editor Al Feldstein, these stories run the gamut from pure supernatural horror (the werewolf story Ã¢â‚¬Å“Upon ReflectionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the vampire story Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fare Tonight, Followed by Increasing ClottynessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) to science gone horribly wrong (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bats in My Belfry!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), as well as the classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“disbeliever gets his comeuppanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ story (Ã¢â‚¬Å“GroundsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ For Horror!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) to ECÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bread and butter, the ridiculously grisly revenge-of-the-abused tale (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Trophy!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well-Cooked Hams!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ seasoned with buckets of blood and some of the most godawful punning titles ever committed to newsprint. Tales From the Crypt was the inspiration for the no-holds-barred pop-culture horror revolution of the 1970s and later, be it Stephen King, Tobe (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) Hooper, zombiemeister George A. Romero, or the current generation of extreme-horror practitioners like Eli (Hostel) Roth. Yet try as they may, no one has been able to capture the combination of technical virtuosity, tongue-in-cheek grisliness, and sheer naughty desire to provoke and appall that these classics managed to pull off again and again. Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Taint the MeatÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ will also include extensive story notes by EC experts from around the world.
