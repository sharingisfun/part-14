Their doubts start when they have to sign a clause accepting the GrÃƒÂ¶nholm method, which nobody ever heard of. It soon becomes clear the tests are dirty mind games, but never what is true and what the trick. They must guess who among them is the HR mole, and repeatedly eliminate one of their number from the procedure. Their priorities, ethics and loyalty are put trough stressing tests.\n\n\nThis is the best version of the film currently available online. The video comes from a full DVD. The subtitles come from some guy who fixed and perfected them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:433690e0fbb4cf79ce2c47fea97a096b34d61188","amp;dn":"2005+-+El+m%26eacute%3Btodo+%28The+Method%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"433690e0fbb4cf79ce2c47fea97a096b34d61188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,54,144,224,251,180,207,121,206,44,71,254,169,122,9,107,52,214,17,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
