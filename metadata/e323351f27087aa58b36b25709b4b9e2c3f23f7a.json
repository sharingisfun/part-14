In 1983, Schilling released &quot;Major Tom (Coming Home),&quot; a synth pop retelling of Bowie's 1969 classic &quot;Space Oddity.&quot; It became Schilling's first and only entry in the U.S. charts, a song that eventually stigmatized him as a one-hit wonder in America. Schilling was born in Stuttgart, Germany, on January 28, 1956. As a teen, Schilling couldn't decide on whether to be a soccer player or a singer. He chose music and his debut album, Error in the System, appeared in 1983. The single &quot;Major Tom (Coming Home)&quot; wasn't just popular in the U.S., it was a worldwide smash. The video was played often on MTV, as well, but Schilling was not able to equal its success. In 1989, Schilling collaborated with Enigma's Michael CrÃƒÂ©tu on the track &quot;Different Story (World of Lust and Crime),&quot; an admirable attempt at updating his sound and trying to return to the American charts. &quot;Major Tom&quot; was given a techno sheen in 1994, and the reworked song was welcomed in the clubs. A year later, Schilling formed the Space Pilots with Catyana Schilling, J. Feifel, and P. Magnet, recording Trip to Orion. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.89% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tWea Japan\nCatalog:\t\tWPCR-1463\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Only Dreams\n02.Lifetime Guarantee\n03.The Noah Plan\n04.Error In The System\n05.Major Tom (Coming Home)\n06.Major Tom, Part 2\n07.(Let's Play) U.S.A.\n08.I Have No Desire\n09.Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht (Silent Night, Holy Night)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e323351f27087aa58b36b25709b4b9e2c3f23f7a","amp;dn":"Peter+Schilling+-+Error+In+The+System+%281997%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e323351f27087aa58b36b25709b4b9e2c3f23f7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,35,53,31,39,8,122,165,139,54,178,87,9,180,185,226,195,242,63,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
