Yet the Killing Fields of Cambodia remain unexplained. Until now.\r\nOne of the most harrowing and compelling personal documentaries of our time, ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE exposes for the first time the truth about the Killing Fields and the Khmer Rouge who were behind Cambodia's horrific genocide. More than simply an inquiry into Cambodia's experience, however, ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE is a profound meditation on the nature of good and evil, shedding light on the capacity of some people to do terrible things and for others to forgive them.\r\nThis riveting film takes audiences as close to witnessing evil as they are ever likely to get. It is also a personal journey into the heart of darkness by journalist/filmmaker Thet Sambath, whose family was wiped out in the Killing Fields, but whose patience and discipline elicits unprecedented on-camera confessions from perpetrators at all levels of the Khmer Rouge hierarchy including Nuon Chea aka Brother Number Two now on trial for genocide. This is investigative journalism of the highest order. \r\n\r\nAn Old Street Films/Thet Sambath production in association with American Documentary/POV\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ef/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/08/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7f/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/70/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/08/Enemies-of-the-People-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2 828 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970 fps\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english/khmer\r\nRunTime Per Part: 1h 24mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.89 GB\r\nSource: HDTV (Thanks to TrollHD)\r\nEncoded by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Enemies_of_the_People","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1af6317280077ee5e83272040bd8159b24d2a81","amp;dn":"PBS+POV+Enemies+of+the+People+720p+x264+AC3+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1af6317280077ee5e83272040bd8159b24d2a81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,175,99,23,40,0,119,238,94,131,39,32,64,189,129,89,178,77,42,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
