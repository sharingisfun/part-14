Normally I'd get all these runs pretty easily from there (Thanks, you MPAA anti-piracy douche bags).\nI went on a hunt today from various sites to get all three creator's complete comic runs, and after hours of painstaking searching and renaming, I hit the jackpot!\nSo HERE IT IS, folks! This is my tribute to DEMONOID, that had the best comic collection online that I'd seen. All three full creators' runs. \n\n2 - Matt Fraction's complete run on Invincible Iron Man[/url]\n3 - Jonathan Hickman's complete run on Fantastic Four and FF[/url]\n\nThis is Part 1:\nEd Brubaker's FULL run on Captain America vol. 5 (number 1 to 50), then through the renumbering (600 to 219), then the renaming Captain America and Bucky (620 to 628), Captain America: REBORN, and Captain America vol. 6 (1 to 19). I've also included Winter Soldier as a bonus. I know there's still two issues left till Brubaker's run is finished, but I thought I'd add it anyway. Hopefully someone else can add those to this volume later. \nI've only included Ed Brubaker's runs on the comics. For example, Captain America and Bucky changes name and creators after issue 628. I havent included anything after 628. \nENJOY! And I hope this works. Comments, and criticisms highly appreciated! All credit goes to the original scanners! ROck on, u awesome ppls!\nPLEASE SEED!!\nRandom issues that are included:\n\n[url=&quot;http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100315233145/marveldatabase/images/c/c0/Captain_America_Vol_5_1_MGC_Textless.jpg&quot;]Captain America Vol.5 001[/url]\n[url=&quot;http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/images/captain_america_v5/025.jpg&quot;]Captain America Vol.5 025[/url]\n[url=&quot;http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090521204052/marveldatabase/images/2/2b/Captain_America_Vol_5_50.jpg&quot;]Captain America Vol.5 050[/url]\n[url=&quot;http://images.wikia.com/marveldatabase/images/f/f6/Captain_America_Reborn_Vol_1_6.jpg&quot;]Captain America Reborn[/url]\n[url=&quot;http://cdn.ifanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Captain-America-and-Bucky_623-674x1024.jpg&quot;]Captain America and Bucky[/url]\n[url=&quot;http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110713015230/marveldatabase/images/5/5c/Captain_America_Vol_6_1.jpg&quot;]Captain America Vol. 6[/url]\n[url=&quot;http://images.wikia.com/marveldatabase/images/f/fd/Winter_Soldier_Vol_1_2.jpg&quot;]Winter Soldier [/url]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed1944c847f791eae5566e0d95b1aaad7f819638","amp;dn":"Captain+America%2C+Winter+Soldier+-+Ed+Brubaker+Run+%28COMPLETE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed1944c847f791eae5566e0d95b1aaad7f819638","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,25,68,200,71,247,145,234,229,86,110,13,149,177,170,173,127,129,150,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
