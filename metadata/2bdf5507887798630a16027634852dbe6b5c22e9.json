In Death on Credit, Ferdinand Bardamu, Celine's alter ego, is a doctor in Paris treating the poor, who seldom pay him but who take every advantage of his availability. The action is not continuous but goes back in time to earlier memories and often moves into fantasy. This fascinating book by one of the greatest 20th-century novelists is an unforgettable experience for the reader. Translated and with an introduction by Ralph Manheim","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bdf5507887798630a16027634852dbe6b5c22e9","amp;dn":"Louis-Ferdinand+Celine+-+1936+-+Death+on+Credit+%28477p%29+%5BInua%5D.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bdf5507887798630a16027634852dbe6b5c22e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,223,85,7,136,119,152,99,10,22,2,118,52,133,45,190,107,92,34,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
