It was considered a comeback for Bowie in the U.S. market; it was his highest charting album (No. 14) since Tonight (1984), and earned some of his strongest reviews since Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980). Worldwide, it sold over two million copies and experienced a four-month run on the UK charts. Although its production had started before September 11 attacks in 2001, the album was finished after that date, which ended up influencing its concept.\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nQuality: FLAC/tracks\n\nTracklist:\n1.
