Subspace, the ultimate release, has never been attainableÃ¢â‚¬â€until now.\nSheri and Jared, husband and wife, submit their bodies and minds to the trainers theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve chosen to lead them into the world of BDSM.\nFor one powerful night, they'll experience subspace and a deep, emotional bonding that will forever change their lives.\n\nDouble Dare: SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been on her own for a long time, closing her heart to love, because love equals pain. As a sex therapist, she needs to assume a dominant roll with her clients, but as a woman, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all submissive.\nIn Steve and Jeff sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found the Doms who can take her to every sexual height sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever imagined and beyond. But now they want more, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure she can give it. It takes one hot night at Inferno with these two men to let her know thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to life than just physical release.\n\nTriple Thrill: Brock has fantasized about men his whole life, but he loves women tooÃ¢â‚¬â€especially Yasmine, his wife. After a tell-all game of truth or dare, he admits the one deep, dark secret heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never revealed to the love of his life. Months later they wind up at Inferno with Jeremy, the coupleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend.\nThe evening meant to fulfill BrockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yearnings quickly becomes a night of adventure for all three, with a lot more love laid on the line than any of them could have imagined.\n\nThe Game: Nick is ready for some fun and searches Inferno for just the right man to spend the evening with. He spots the gorgeous black man as he walks to the bar and sets his sights. His name is Leon, known as The Black Devil, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everything Nick needs.\nThe sex is more than he ever imagined it could be, and The Black Devil lives up to his name. The best part, though, is that when the game is over, Nick gets to take him home. Inferno is their refuge, and with each game they play, it only gets better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85352427ca0f8b480144368314c3baeeb8aa4bbf","amp;dn":"Inferno+Series+by+Anna+Leigh+Keaton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85352427ca0f8b480144368314c3baeeb8aa4bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,53,36,39,202,15,139,72,1,68,54,131,20,195,186,238,184,170,75,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
