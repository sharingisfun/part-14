The once-great city of Bohane on the west coast of Ireland is on its knees, infested by vice and split along tribal lines. There are the posh parts of town, but it is in the slums and backstreets of Smoketown, the tower blocks of the Northside Rises and the eerie bogs of Big Nothin' that the city really lives.\n\nFor years, the city has been in the cool grip of Logan Hartnett, the dapper godfather of the Hartnett Fancy gang. But there's trouble in the air. They say his old nemesis is back in town; his trusted henchmen are getting ambitious; and his missus wants him to give it all up and go straight... And then there's his mother.\n\nCity of Bohane is a visionary novel that blends influences from film and the graphic novel, from Trojan beats and calypso rhythms, from Celtic myth and legend, from fado and the sagas, and from all the great inheritance of Irish literature. A work of mesmerising imagination and vaulting linguistic invention, it is a taste of the glorious and new.\n\n\n* Michel Houellebecq Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Map and the Territory\n\nThe novel tells the story of the life and art of Jed Martin, a fictional French artist who becomes famous by photographing Michelin maps and painting scenes about professional activities. His father is slowly entering old age. Jed falls for a beautiful Russian executive from Michelin but is unable to hang onto this relationship. He becomes extraordinarily successful and therefore suddenly rich. He meets Michel Houellebecq in Ireland in order to ask him to write the text for the catalog of one of his exhibits, and offers to paint the writer's portrait.\nA few months later Houellebecq is brutally murdered and Jed Martin gets involved in the case.\n\n\n* Andrew Miller Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pure\n\nPure is a 2011 novel by English author Andrew Miller. The book is the sixth novel by Miller and was released on 9 June 2011 in the United Kingdom through Sceptre, an imprint of Hodder &amp; Stoughton. The novel is set in pre-revolutionary France and the upcoming turmoil is a consistent theme throughout. It follows an engineer named Jean-Baptiste Baratte and chronicles his efforts in clearing an overfilled graveyard which is polluting the surrounding area. Baratte makes friends and enemies as the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district.\n\n\n\n* Haruki Murakami Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1Q84\n\nThe year is 1984 and the city is Tokyo.\n\nA young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“Q is for Ã¢â‚¬Ëœquestion mark.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ A world that bears a question.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. \n\nAs AomameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and TengoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.\n\nA love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George OrwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬â€ 1Q84 is Haruki MurakamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers\n\n\n\n* Julie Otsuka Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Buddha in the Attic\n\nJulie OtsukaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-awaited follow-up to When the Emperor Was Divine is a tour de force of economy and precision, a novel that tells the story of a group of young women brought from Japan to San Francisco as Ã¢â‚¬Å“picture bridesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ nearly a century ago.\n\nIn eight incantatory sections, The Buddha in the Attic traces the picture bridesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ extraordinary lives, from their arduous journey by boat, where they exchange photographs of their husbands, imagining uncertain futures in an unknown land; to their arrival in San Francisco and their tremulous first nights as new wives; to their backbreaking work picking fruit in the fields and scrubbing the floors of white women; to their struggles to master a new language and a new culture; to their experiences in childbirth, and then as mothers, raising children who will ultimately reject their heritage and their history; to the deracinating arrival of war.\n\n\n\n* Arthur Phillips Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Tragedy of Arthur\n\nThe Tragedy of Arthur is a 2011 novel by American author Arthur Phillips. The narrative concerns the publication of a recently discovered Arthurian play attributed to William Shakespeare, which the main narrator, &quot;Arthur Phillips&quot;, believes to be a forgery produced by his father. It was published by Random House.\nThe book takes the form of an edition of the play, The Tragedy of Arthur, along with an extensive introduction and footnotes by Phillips, and additional notes by the publishers who argue for the play's authenticity. The introduction also serves as a memoir of the protagonist as he tells the story of his family and their connection to the apocryphal text.\n\n\n\n* Karen Russell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Swamplandia!\n\nSwamplandia! is a 2011 novel by Karen Russell. Set in the Ten Thousand Islands, off the southwest coast of Florida, it is the story of the Bigtree family of alligator wrestlers who live on Swamplandia!, an alligator-wrestling theme park.

Banished to a barren island, Jonas recalls his gift for curing &quot;female maladies,&quot; his exorcism of a walking corpse on the remote Snjafjoll coast, the frenzied massacre of innocent Basque whalers at the hands of local villagers, and the deaths of three of his children.\n\n\n\n* Kjersti A. Skomsvold Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Faster I Walk , The Smaller I Am\n\nMathea Martinsen has never been good at dealing with other people. After a lifetime, her only real accomplishment is her longevity: everyone she reads about in the obituaries has died younger than she is now. Afraid that her life will be over before anyone knows that she lived, Mathea digs out her old wedding dress, bakes some sweet cakes, and heads out into the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€to make her mark. She buries a time capsule out in the yard. (It gets dug up to make room for a flagpole.) She wears her late husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s watch and hopes people will ask her for the time. (They never do.) Is it really possible for a woman to disappear so completely that the world wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t notice her passing? The Faster I Walk, the Smaller I Am is a macabre twist on the notion that life Ã¢â‚¬Å“must be lived to the fullest.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\n* Tommy Wieringa Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Caesarion (translated from Dutch by Sam Garrett)\n\nFrom internationally best-selling author Tommy Wieringa, comes a rich and engrossing novel about a man on an odyssey in search of answers about his dysfunctional artistic family and the legacy they left behind.\n\nWhen Ludwig Unger returned to his hometown after a decade, he arrived with a plastic bag filled with his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ashes and little else. He was there to make amends with his lonely past, to say goodbye to the familial ghosts that still haunted him. Raised in a cliff-top cottage on the coast of England, LudwigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother tried to create a normal life for her son after her husband one day left them to pursue his art. A mamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boy, Ludwig grew up in her shadow, developing an obsession with her and her sensual allure. But when he discovered the secret of her past as the world-famous porn star Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eve LaSageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and her plans for a comeback, LudwigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world spun out of control. He soon found himself homeless, shouldering the shame of his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, and embarking on a journey that took him around the world.\n\nLittle Caesar is a story of beauty and decay, of filial loyalty and parental betrayal, and of the importance of self-sacrifice.\n\nFor IMPAC Dublin 2014 Shortlists by nepalifiction visit this link :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9938934/IMPAC_Dublin_Literary_Award_Shortlist_2014_(9_Books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9938934/IMPAC_Dublin_Literary_Award_Shortlist_2014_(9_Books)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor IMPAC Dublin Literary Award Winners from 1996-2013 also by nepalifiction visit this link :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9748284/International_IMPAC_Dublin_Literary_Award_(1996_ndash_2013)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9748284/International_IMPAC_Dublin_Literary_Award_(1996_ndash_2013)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb7f4bb80a53b2e6bcbe3422202c72791aee38df","amp;dn":"IMPAC+Dublin+Literary+Award+Shortlist+2013+%2810+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb7f4bb80a53b2e6bcbe3422202c72791aee38df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,127,75,184,10,83,178,230,188,190,52,34,32,44,114,121,26,238,56,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
