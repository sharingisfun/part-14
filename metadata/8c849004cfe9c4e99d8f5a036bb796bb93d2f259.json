One of its strengths is that it was written by trainees in internal medicine who understand the need for rapid access to accurate and concise clinical information, with a practical approach to clinical problem solving. \n\n\nFrom the reviews of the third edition:\n\n&quot;I will be using this as my first-line book to carry with me. The inclusion of JAMA's Rational Clinical Exam highlights is an added evidence-based bonus.&quot; - Christine Navarro, McMaster University, Med student, year 3\n\n&quot;Provides practical differential diagnoses for common clinical problems. I greatly appreciate that all units are metric/SI, as similar American resources often do not include lab values in convenient units for practice in Canada.&quot; - Jackie Wolting, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry (University of Western Ontario) Med student, year 4\n\n&quot;With its tiny print, block layout, and condensed information, this small and lightweight book is a source of information that can be easily carried around and referenced when you need a reminder while you're on the wards. The index of this book is a pretty good help in navigating through the different pathologies, and the information is reasonably well laid out but it means that this book really is only for the person who has read up on the topics and who just needs a jump-start to remember what they've read before. As such it's probably best for 3rd or 4th year students, working in a practical clinical setting.&quot; - Geeta Yadav, Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Medical student, year 4\n\n&quot;This is by far the best handbook I have reviewed over the past 4 years. A must for every medical student going through clerkship. Adequately Canadian-based compared to the Massachusetts General Hospital pocket handbook.&quot; - Jean-Claude Quintal, University of Dalhousie, Family medicine resident, year 1\n\n &quot;As the Chief Handbook Editor of Toronto Notes, the reviewed publication could be considered the competition! However, I have been truly impressed by this product.&quot; - Behzad Hassani, University of Toronto, Med student, year 4\n\n&quot;I enjoyed the helpful mnemonics and the overall ease through which you can maneuver through information.&quot; - Martin Korzeniowski, McMaster University, Med student, year 2\n\n &quot;Approach to Internal Medicine is a useful and concise text that provides a practical foundation for common clinical problems.&quot; - Ben Wilson, MD, University of Calgary, First year internal medicine resident\n\n&quot;I have been recommending your book to all of my friends since the start of my residency and they all love it! There was one girl who was resistant to it (because of the small font) but I just bought it for her and she told me she wished she had it while she was actually a resident in internal medicine. The book is comprehensive and succinct at the same time. It was a great tool during my residency and now completely invaluable while studying for the Royal College exam.&quot; - Revital Wanono, MD, University of British Columbia, Respirology fellow, UBC\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is the third edition of a small book with abbreviated, high-yield information on internal medicine diagnoses. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The audience is clearly clinicians ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ . This book would be most useful for practitioners close to the U.S.-Canadian border, as it lists laboratory references in the common units for both countries. In its function as a memory-jogger, it may have value for internal medicine residents who, once they are reminded of a concept, can further delineate a differential diagnosis.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Vincent Carr, DoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Review Service)\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 478 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 3rd Edition. edition (Jan 31 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1441965041\n# ISBN-13: 978-1441965042","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c849004cfe9c4e99d8f5a036bb796bb93d2f259","amp;dn":"Approach+to+Internal+Medicine++3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c849004cfe9c4e99d8f5a036bb796bb93d2f259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,132,144,4,207,233,196,233,157,143,90,3,107,183,150,187,147,210,242,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
