Version 1.0 is often an important milestone that denotes the maturity of a free software project. The first public version of what would become Tails was released on June 23 2009, when it was called Amnesia. That was almost five years ago. Tails 1.0 marks the 36th stable release since then. Since then we have been working on the many features we think are essential both in terms of security and usability: USB installer; automatic upgrades; persistence; support for Tor bridges and other special Tor configuration; MAC address spoofing; extensive and translated documentation.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a13d92363518e405c23d2bc1e6c02e5599ac573e","amp;dn":"Tails+1.0++32-bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a13d92363518e405c23d2bc1e6c02e5599ac573e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,61,146,54,53,24,228,5,194,61,43,193,230,192,46,85,153,172,87,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
