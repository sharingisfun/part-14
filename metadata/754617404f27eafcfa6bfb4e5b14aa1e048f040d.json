PrintFolders offers three customizable output formats: HTML, plain-text and unformatted plain-text. HTML can include direct links to the listed files, unformatted plain-text may be used with spreadsheet and database programs. The output files are clear and easily understandable.\n\nThe output file format can be customized to fit your needs:\n\nYou can filter files to be included, set how the list will look and where the file will be located. PrintFolders is especially useful for listing MP3 music because it can make use of ID3 tags. The &quot;Custom root&quot; option is useful for cataloguing files before burning them onto a CD or DVD, especially if you're going to place the list file on the same disc. The folder browser and the most of the options are accessible directly from the main window.\n\nSystem requirements : \n\nWindows 2000/XP/Vista/7 (32 or 64 bit)\n\nHomepage: http://www.stratopoint.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program\n- Use given key to register application.\n- Done, Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:754617404f27eafcfa6bfb4e5b14aa1e048f040d","amp;dn":"Stratopoint+PrintFolders+v2.51c+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"754617404f27eafcfa6bfb4e5b14aa1e048f040d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,70,23,64,79,39,234,252,250,107,251,78,91,20,170,30,4,143,4,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
