And a delight it is indeed, bright and percussive, and when conga player Carlos &quot;Patato&quot; Valdes joins Taylor and pianist Wynton Kelly and bassist Paul Chambers on three cuts (Thelonious Monk's &quot;Epistrophy,&quot; &quot;Move&quot; and a Taylor calypso-inflected original called &quot;Cookoo and Fungi&quot;), the rhythm pocket opens into a deep blue sea for the horn men (Stanley Turrentine on tenor sax and Dave Burns on trumpet). &quot;Move&quot; does exactly that, it moves, and at a blistering pace. Monk's &quot;Epistrophy,&quot; thanks in part to Valdes, reveals its rumba roots, and has never sounded brighter. The seldom-covered Coltrane composition &quot;Syeeda's Song Flute&quot; seems likewise refreshed and revived. The lone Taylor original, the driving &quot;Cookoo and Fungi,&quot; is as sharp and alert is a kitten waking from a nap in the spring sun, and Taylor's drum solo is crisp, efficient and slides seamlessly into the calypso-informed main theme. A.T.'s Delight is a solid outing, with a wonderfully nervous but completely focused energy.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01. Syeeda's Song\n 02. Epistrophy\n 03. Move\n 04. High Seas\n 05.
