In combination, they lock together for extraordinary harmonies, perfectly blending and magically complementing each other. This vocal wizardry is at the heart of their phenomenal success, which spanned five decades and transcended multiple genres with chart-busting glory. From their Beatles-esque ?60s roots and the subsequent flowering of their own progressive pop-rock songwriting and performance style through their blue-eyed R&amp;B superstardom and Saturday Night Fever disco-era domination, the Bee Gees constantly evolved and never stopped delivering timeless hits. The trio?s beautifully crafted, sonically enchanting work is one of the cornerstones of contemporary popular music, and this hit-packed compilation spotlights their career-spanning best.\n(Source: Amazon.com}\n\n\nOriginal Release Date: November 20, 2001\nGenre: Baroque Pop\n\n\nTrack Listings:\n\nDisc: 1\n1.
