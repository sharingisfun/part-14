Years earlier, Troy had attempted to kill Archer, who barely survived with a chest wound, but the bullet struck Archer's little son Michael who died of his injuries.\n\nTroy is recorded in the FBI files to have a whole list of terrorism-related offences, including bombings and political assassinations. The FBI receives information that Castor's brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) has chartered a plane at a Los Angeles airport, and Archer knows the Troy brothers well enough to guess that Pollux &quot;doesn't fly without big brother!&quot; Archer leads an FBI team in chasing the plane down a runway and is able to shoot out one of the engines. Unable to take off, Castor kills both the pilot and one of Archer's agents, then crashes the plane into a hangar. In the ensuing chaos, which leaves several FBI agents wounded or dead, Pollux is captured by the Feds and Castor is knocked into a coma after bragging to Archer about a biological bomb that will destroy Los Angeles.\n\nArcher initially believes Castor was bluffing, but after the FBI finds schematics for the bomb on a disk recovered from Pollux's briefcase, Archer realizes that the threat is genuine. Although he learns the date of the bombing from several of Castor's henchmen, including Castor's bomb supplier Dietrich Hassler (Nick Cassavetes), Archer is unable to find any information about the location of the bomb itself. Knowing that the only way to obtain the location is from Castor's brother, Pollux, Archer's colleagues, Tito and Miller, present him with a top-secret mission and convince him to undergo a surgical procedure to temporarily graft Archer's face and pose as Castor in order to gain information about the bomb from Pollux. (Though the time-period is never specified in the film and largely implied to be the present, the technology shown here and later in the prison is partially anachronistic, contrasting with the technology used in the rest of the film.)\n\nAfter the procedure, arrangements are made for Archer (as Castor) to be incarcerated with Pollux at the Erehwon Penitentiary (Erehwon being &quot;nowhere&quot; spelled backwards), where he convinces Pollux that he is Castor and learns the bomb's location. Meanwhile, Castor unexpectedly awakens from his coma (it is implied this is a result of shock from the trauma of the surgery) and, realizing what has happened, calls his men to kidnap Doctor Walsh (Colm Feore), the doctor who performed the surgery. He then forces Walsh to give him Archer's face.\n\nCastor (as Archer) then visits Archer (as Castor) at Erehwon prison. Castor tells the shocked Archer about how he killed Walsh, Tito and Miller, how he destroyed all evidence of their face-swap, and his plan to abuse Archer's job and have sex with his wife. Castor has the FBI negotiate a deal with Pollux for his release in return for revealing the bomb's location (which is at the Los Angeles Convention Center). Castor then proceeds to disarm the bomb and revels in praise from his colleagues and the media, having informed his brother that they are &quot;going straight&quot;, meaning they will use Archer's identity and influence to their advantage and for their own purposes. Ironically, given Castor's gregarious, irreverent nature and off-beat sense of humor, he becomes more popular at work than the real Archer was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the impatient and bad tempered Archer having spoiled victory celebrations with reminders of the lives that they had cost.\n\nAfter Castor's disarmament of the bomb, Archer escapes from Erehwon prison, which is revealed to be inside an offshore oil platform in the Pacific Ocean, and swims to shore. Some time later, Archer visits Dietrich and successfully fools him and the rest of Castor's men into thinking that he is the real Castor Troy. Archer then asks Dietrich for help killing Castor (as Archer).\n\nBy this point, both men have begun to see firsthand how their hatred for one another affects each other's close ones. As Archer, Castor revels in the praises of his co-workers, is more tender and affectionate with wife Eve (Joan Allen) than Sean was, and even reaches out to Archer's teenage daughter Jamie (Dominique Swain): Castor smokes cigarettes openly with her, gives her a balisong for protection, and even violently assaults a boy (played by Danny Masterson) who tries to force himself on Jamie. He even feels compassion for Eve when they visit her son's grave on what should have been his birthday.\n\nMeanwhile, Archer (forced to play along with the part of Troy) finds himself having to take drugs and impress the terrorists with his knowledge about Sean Archer which even Castor never knew. Also present is Sasha Hassler (Gina Gershon), Dietrich's sister and Castor's ex-girlfriend, and her son Adam. Archer is told that Adam is Troy's son (one thing on Troy that he appears to have been unaware of) and sees a lot of his late son Michael in Adam. Earlier, when he was himself, Archer interrogated Sasha and threatened to put her son into foster care. He now comes to realize that she is in fact a devoted mother and feels sorry for what he did. Later, when she offers to join him in his final battle with Troy (as Archer), Archer (as Troy) promises her &quot;whatever happens, Sean Archer's off your back for good.&quot;\n\nPollux Troy is watching Dietrich's apartment and informs Castor of Archer's arrival. Castor sends an FBI team to kill Archer. There follows a brutal, lengthy gunfight, in which many FBI agents and terrorists are killed. Dietrich is killed by Castor as he tries to shield Sasha and Adam, who manage to evade capture. As he makes his own escape, Archer catches Pollux and drops him through the apartment skylight. Pollux falls to the ground and is killed outright. Castor is left distraught and almost suicidal over the death of his brother. When an FBI agent asks why he is shedding tears for the likes of Pollux Troy, Castor shoots him dead on the spot.\n\nFBI Director Victor Lazarro (Harve Presnell) berates Castor (as Archer) for his unnecessary carnage with the terrorists and queries as to how he happens to suddenly know so much about their movements. Castor, still angry over the death of Pollux, confesses his true identity to Lazarro and kills him, blaming Lazarro's death on a heart attack. As a result, Castor becomes appointed as the new acting-FBI Director. Meanwhile, Archer returns to his suburban home and tries to explain the entire situation and convince his wife, Eve, that he is really Archer, but to no avail. After an analysis of Castor's blood type, Eve still does not believe, but after her husband tells her the story of how they had their first kiss, she eventually realizes the truth.\n\nSasha and Archer track Castor to Lazarro's funeral, where Castor is holding Archer's wife and daughter Jamie hostage. With Eve caught in the middle, cops and gangsters hold each other at gunpoint. A gunfight then ensues in which Sasha and all of Castor's minions are killed. Having taken a bullet to save Archer, Sasha begs him not to let Adam grow up to be a criminal.\n\nCastor and Archer engage in both a gun battle and hand-to-hand fight, with Archer gaining the upper hand. Jamie finds a gun and shoots at Archer (as Castor), believing him to be the real Castor, and wounds him in the shoulder, allowing the real Castor to break free. Castor takes Jamie hostage but she gets him to let go by stabbing him in the leg ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ironically a trick which he himself taught her earlier.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b83d62d64c038fc447241398c8c9065af9d803","amp;dn":"FACE%2FOFF.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b83d62d64c038fc447241398c8c9065af9d803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,184,61,98,214,76,3,143,196,71,36,19,152,200,201,6,90,249,216,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
