It is a nostalgic look at the music of a previous generation. The song was featured in the Tom Cruise film Risky Business and gained widespread notoriety because of its inclusion. The track was also featured on WKRP in Cincinnati on the episode &quot;Pilot: Part Two&quot;, shortly after its initial release. The song was recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Muscle Shoals, AL. The famous piano &quot;false start&quot; at the beginning of the song was actually an error caused by the tape operator at the recording studio. Seger and his management, however, liked how the &quot;mistake&quot; sounded and kept it in the final mix.\n\n&quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; achieved substantial album-oriented rock radio airplay and as the fourth single from Stranger in Town, it reached number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1979. It was re-released in 1983 after its inclusion in the film Risky Business and reached number 48 on the Billboard singles chart. The song remains a staple on classic rock radio. In 1996, it was ranked #2 among the Top 40 Jukebox Singles of All Time by the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association.\n\nIn Australia, the song was released twice and charted for a total of 55 weeks. The first run was in 1983 after its use in the film &quot;Risky Business&quot;. The second run saw it reach #3 in late 1987.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d6a2d2c05097ad6318b95ed73510d89872d412","amp;dn":"Bob+Seger+%26+The+Silver+Bullet+Band+-+Old+Time+Rock+%26+Roll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d6a2d2c05097ad6318b95ed73510d89872d412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,214,162,210,192,80,151,173,99,24,185,94,215,53,16,216,152,114,212,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
