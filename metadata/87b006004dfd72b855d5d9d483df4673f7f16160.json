He counters by adding a veneer of respectability to his own operation. Meanwhile he exposes Wallingham for a fraud.\nA delightful example of 1930's comedy, with James Cagney on fire as a tough and uncultured geneologist-scam artist who matches wits with an assortment of shady types in pursuit of a dead rich woman's fortune.\n\nThe dialogue is snappy and frequently laugh-out loud, the supporting cast led by Bette Davis is fine, and James Cagney is particularly hilarious in his portrayal.\n\nOne of the subplots involves Cagney's attempts to learn a little class with which to impress his love/nemesis Davis, and there is a sustained scene of hijinks concerning this that will have you laughing and commending Cagney's acting at the same time. All I can say is that I will never look at tea the same way again!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87b006004dfd72b855d5d9d483df4673f7f16160","amp;dn":"Jimmy+The+Gent+%28Bette+Davis%2C+James+Cagney%29+%5B1934%5D+%40%21%5E%5E+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87b006004dfd72b855d5d9d483df4673f7f16160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,176,6,0,77,253,114,184,85,213,217,212,131,223,70,115,247,241,97,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
