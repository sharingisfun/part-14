Gathered in Their Masses (2013) [Deluxe Edition] Blu-ray 1080i AVC DTS-HD 5.1\n\n\n\nBlack Sabbath is an English heavy metal band formed in 1968 in Birmingham, West Midlands, England, United Kingdom, originally comprising Ozzy Osbourne (vocals), Tony Iommi (guitar), Geezer Butler (bass), and Bill Ward (drums). In the early 1970s they were the first to pair heavily distorted, sonically dissonant blues-rock at slow speeds with lyrics about drugs, mental pain, and abominations of war, thus giving birth to generations of metal bands that followed in their wake. They are often credited with creating the heavy metal genre as well as the doom metal subgenre. \n\nRead more about Black Sabbath on Last.fm.

Sadly, he died suddenly in early 2011; this 2010 Montreux set was his last filmed concert. \n\nHe's got energy to spare here, playing classics plus new songs: Over the Hills and Far Away; Blood of Emeralds; So Far Away/Empty Rooms; Military Man; Parisienne Walkways; Oh Wild One , and more on CD, DVD or Blu-Ray!\n\n\nGary Moore- Vocals, Guitar, Neil Carter-Keyboards and Guitars, Jonathan Noyce-Bass, Darrin Mooney-Drums\n\n\n\n\n01.

On 5 November 2013, the film will also get theatrical screenings in 20 cities worldwide, and the next day it will be screened for one night only in 40 other territories. The album contains the band's performance at Rome's Stadio Olimpico on 6 July 2013, in front of a crowd of 60,963 people. The concert was a part of The Unsustainable Tour, which is a moniker for the band's summer 2013 European leg of The 2nd Law World Tour.\n\nThe cameras which brought the concert to screen were sixteen Sony PMW-F55 CineAlta 4K cameras, and with a variety of cinema lenses, including 5 Angenieux 24/290Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, an Elite 120/520, a number of Optimo 14/52Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and with Fujinon 19-90 Cabrio and 85-300 Cabrio. Furthermore, a crane, a Towercam, various hotheads and a Spidercam were used. All images were recorded in HD and 4K on three terabyte hard drives. Alongside video, 120 lines of multi-track audio were recorded, all redundant. The result of all of this was 4 sets with material, 2 main sets and 2 back-up sets. In other words, an enormous amount of data.\n\nThe show was directed by Matt Askem (with whom the band worked on two previous videos, Hullabaloo: Live at Le Zenith, Paris and HAARP), and produced by Serpent Productions. \n\n\nMatthew Bellamy (lead vocals, guitars, keyboards, synthesisers, keytar), Christopher Wolstenholme (bass), Misa Kitara (harmonica, backing vocals), Dominic Howard (drums, percussion, synthesisers, backing vocals), Touring musicians: Morgan Nicholls (keytar, sampler, percussion, guitar, bass, backing vocals), Alessandro Cortini (keyboards, synthesisers)\n\n\n\n\n01. &quot;Intro&quot;  \n02. &quot;Supremacy&quot;  \n03. &quot;Panic Station&quot;  \n04. &quot;Plug In Baby&quot;  \n05. &quot;Resistance&quot;  \n06. &quot;Animals&quot;  \n07. &quot;Knights of Cydonia&quot;  \n08. &quot;Explorers&quot;  \n09. &quot;Hysteria&quot;  \n10. &quot;Feeling Good&quot;  \n11. &quot;Follow Me&quot;  \n12. &quot;Madness&quot;  \n13. &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot;  \n14. &quot;Guiding Light&quot;  \n15. &quot;Undisclosed Desires&quot;  \n16. &quot;Supermassive Black Hole&quot;  \n17. &quot;Survival&quot;  \n18. &quot;The 2nd Law: Isolated System&quot;  \n19. &quot;Uprising&quot;  \n20. &quot;Starlight&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--------------\n--------------\n--------------\n--------------\n--------------\n\n\n\nLed Zeppelin: Celebration Day (2007) Blu-ray 1080i AVC DTS-HD 5.1\n\n\nOn December 10, 2007, Led Zeppelin took the stage at London's O2 Arena to headline a tribute concert for dear friend and Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun. What followed was a two-hour-plus tour de force of the band's signature blues-infused rock 'n' roll that instantly became part of the legend of Led Zeppelin. \n\nFounding members John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were joined by Jason Bonham, the son of their late drummer John Bonham, to perform 16 songs from their celebrated catalog including landmark tracks &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; &quot;Rock and Roll,&quot; &quot;Kashmir,&quot; and &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;.\n\n\nRobert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Jason Bonham\n\n\n\n01.
