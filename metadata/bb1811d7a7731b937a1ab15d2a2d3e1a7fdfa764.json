The braking phase itself \nstarts by touchdown of the A/C.  \nA corresponding important factor is the weather condition and the \nRWY quality that follows,  \ne.g. Rain or Snow, which will prolong the braking distance extremely. \nBut not only braking distance, as well is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“feelingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of a slippery \nRWY important for a realistic simulation at landing.\nUp to now this important system doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have enough attention and \ndidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize nearly a bit realistic. \nBut this missing system we now give our attention and putting into \naction as realistic as needed.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Down they come allÃ¢â‚¬Å“ is not enough in our thoughts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb1811d7a7731b937a1ab15d2a2d3e1a7fdfa764","amp;dn":"%5BFS9%2FFSX%5D+Aerosoft+-+TSR+Autobrake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb1811d7a7731b937a1ab15d2a2d3e1a7fdfa764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,24,17,215,167,115,27,147,122,26,177,93,42,45,62,26,127,223,167,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
