Melissa Rycroft and former DCC Tina Kalina sit in for Judy and give Kelli some fresh eyes as guest choreographer DJ Gutherie teaches a tough contemporary jazz routine. Kelli tells Vivian she needs to do the jump splits or remove herself from training camp. Cameo photos are the moment of truth for the ladies on weight probation. Also, Kelli and Judy see which of the new girls are photogenic and are surprised by some who are not. Rycroft holds the first ever &quot;dance intervention&quot; to give some candidates the extra confidence they need to make the team. With 40 girls still in training camp, Kelli and Judy must decide how to get the squad to 36. Whose dream will end this week? You might be surprised. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n420","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:231dd28b41332f5e90ab4e1d14e93a399f73a21b","amp;dn":"Dallas+Cowboys+Cheerleaders+Making+The+Team+S09E06+HDTV+x264-BS.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"231dd28b41332f5e90ab4e1d14e93a399f73a21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,29,210,139,65,51,47,94,144,171,78,29,20,233,58,57,159,115,162,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
