Short and sweet analysis of the LSAT test, including all major test skills and methods.\r\n\r\nThe LSAT test requires the proper method to do well. Time is so critical that we must approach the content in just the right way. The LSAT repeatedly uses certain tricks (in LR) to make us mis-interpret situations and go the wrong way. RC section overloads us with information, so we have to figure out what aspects or elements are useful. Games also overloads us, but rather than try to see the big picture, we only need to figure out a bit about how the system moves and what elements play significant roles.\r\n\r\nIncludes vocabulary list (and Chinese translation), which focuses on common nouns and especially unusual verbs. The test uses weird verbs to keep students off balance, the test taker doesn't need to understand the verbs perfectly, but needs to know whether they are positive or negative. Studying nouns more than the basics in this list is mostly pointless, as they range of nouns they will use is massive. The test must be read very abstractly anyway. \r\n\r\nLSATè€ƒè¯•è¯æ±‡ï¼ŒLSATæ‰‹å†Œï¼Œè¯»LSATï¼Œ LSATå­¦ä¹ æ–¹æ³•","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c65124424cbfb43ab2f270cef93e983bcdfcdf5","amp;dn":"LSAT+study+guide+for+non-native+students+%26amp%3B+vocab+list","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c65124424cbfb43ab2f270cef93e983bcdfcdf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,101,18,68,36,203,251,67,171,47,39,12,239,147,233,131,188,223,205,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
