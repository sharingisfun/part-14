He had already composed not only a (lost) symphony but a significant proportion of his chamber music while still a student. The two youthful String Quartets Op.9 in C minor and Op.10 in E major show a Romantic exuberance poured into classic and classical moulds.\r\nThe members of the ISOS Quartet â€” Isabelle van Keulen, Katharine Gowers, Vladimir Mendelssohn and Imke Frank â€” know each other from several important summer festivals as Lockenhaus and Kuhmo. As their CD debut, they recorded both string quartets by Max Bruch exclusively for Koch International Schwann.\r\n\r\nString Quartet in C minor, Op.9\r\n1. I. Adagio.
