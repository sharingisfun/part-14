Helen Shapiro began her singing career as a 14 year old in 1961. Hearing her voice on the first cut from Helen Shapiro at Abbey Road: 1961-1967, &quot;Don't Treat Me Like a Child,&quot; one would never believe it. She sounds confident and as assured as someone who had been in the business for 20 years. Shapiro had some big hits in the early days of her career: &quot;You Don't Know,&quot; &quot;Tell Me What He Said,&quot; and the bouncy &quot;Walkin' Back to Happiness.&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Shapiro&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Shapiro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/at-abbey-road-1961-1967-r351355&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/at-abbey-road-1961-1967-r351355&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbbey Road Studios is a recording studio located at 3 Abbey Road, St John's Wood, City of Westminster, London, England. It was established in November 1931 by the Gramophone Company, a predecessor of British music company EMI, its present owner. Apart from the facility's use as a recording studio, the premises\nhave also been used to remaster many of the classical music recordings made at Kingsway Hall. It is most notable for being the venue in the 1960s for innovative recording techniques adopted by The Beatles, Badfinger, Pink Floyd and others.\nAt the end of 2009, the studios came under threat of sale to property developers, but the studio received historic site status from the British government in 2010 to protect it. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHelen Shapiro  - At Abbey Road 1961-1967\nThis compilation 1998\n\n01  Helen Shapiro - Don't Treat Me Like A Child (Mono)\n02  Helen Shapiro - You Don't Know (Mono)\n03  Helen Shapiro - Walkin' Back To Happiness (Take 2 Plus Studio Conversations) (Stereo)\n04  Helen Shapiro - Walkin' Back to Happiness (Take 13 Master) (Stereo)\n05  Helen Shapiro - Kiss 'N' Run\n06  Helen Shapiro - I Want To Be Happy (Stereo)\n07  Helen Shapiro - Let's Talk About Love (Mono)\n08  Helen Shapiro - Tell Me What He Said (Stereo)\n09  Helen Shapiro - Little Miss Lonely (Mono)\n10  Helen Shapiro - A Teenager Sings The Blues (Mono)\n11  Helen Shapiro - I Can't Say No To Your Kiss (Take 4 B/D And Take 5 Plus Studio Conversations) (Stereo)\n12  Helen Shapiro - Sometime Yesterday (Stereo)\n13  Helen Shapiro - I Don't Care (Stereo)\n14  Helen Shapiro - Basin St. Blues (Mono)\n15  Helen Shapiro - Everyone But The Right One (Mono)\n16  Helen Shapiro - Keep Away From Other Girls (Mono)\n17  Helen Shapiro - A Dozen Other Boys (Take 4 B/D And Take 5 Plus Studio Conversations) (Stereo)\n18  Helen Shapiro - Queen For Tonight (Stereo)\n19  Helen Shapiro - Time And Time Again (Stereo)\n20  Helen Shapiro - Look Who It Is (Mono)\n21  Helen Shapiro - Fever (Mono)\n22  Helen Shapiro - Look Over Your Shoulder (Mono)\n23  Helen Shapiro - Look Over Your Shoulder (Mono)\n24  Helen Shapiro - I Wish I'd Never Loved You (Stereo)\n25  Helen Shapiro - Shop Around (Stereo)\n26  Helen Shapiro - Keep Your Hands Off My Baby (Mono)\n27  Helen Shapiro - You're My Remedy (Mono)\n28  Helen Shapiro - I'm Going Out (The Same Way I Came In) (Mono)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3d22977c360429022f82f8c6f66d7f7535d7d1f","amp;dn":"Helen+Shapiro+-+At+Abbey+Road+1961-1967+%281998%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3d22977c360429022f82f8c6f66d7f7535d7d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,210,41,119,195,96,66,144,34,248,47,140,111,102,215,247,83,93,125,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
