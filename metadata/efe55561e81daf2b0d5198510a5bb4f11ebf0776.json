In a genre where girl\nbands dream of being Destiny?s Vogue, Girls Aloud have made\nan album that reflects what it?s like to be a 20-something\ngirl living in the UK.\n\nThere?s attitude (&quot;Models), there?s heartbreak\n(&quot;Whole Lotta History&quot;), there?s sauciness (&quot;Watch Me Go&quot;).\nMake no mistake this is a 24-carot solid gold pop album but\nthrown into the mix are snatches of rock, house, electro,\nsalsa, rap and ska. The album has been made by breaking the\nrules on what you can do with pop. Who said you can?t have\ntwo choruses in one song or three different sounds in another?\n\nChemistry also features the new hit single &quot;Biology&quot; and the\nforthcoming Christmas single &quot;See The Day&quot; as well as their\nsummer smash &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot;.\n\nhttp://www.girlsaloud.co.uk/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efe55561e81daf2b0d5198510a5bb4f11ebf0776","amp;dn":"Girls+Aloud-Chemistry-2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efe55561e81daf2b0d5198510a5bb4f11ebf0776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,229,85,97,232,29,175,43,13,81,152,81,10,91,180,241,30,191,7,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
