Install\n2. Use our keymaker to generate a serial for a company to use\ninside the installer. All the other fields besides company and\nserial do not matter. You will need to be offline or have a\nfirewall to block the installer from attempting to check the\ndetails remotely\n3. After the installation is complete, you have a few different\noptions to block the forced online check of the serial. See\nbelow for more information\n4. Done\n\nNotes: The best method is to use the patch button inside our\nkeymaker and direct it to where Squeeze.exe is installed. You may\nneed to run the keymaker as admin on Vista/Win7/Win8 if you\ninstalled Squeeze to the Program Files directory. This will make\nSqueeze think it has been successfully authorized and disable the\nonline check. The other method is to block the phone home with\nsome firewall or in the hosts file. The reason why both of these\nmethods aren't recommended is because Squeeze will continually try\nto send your details causing a pointless drain on system\nresources. For the hosts file, add following:\n\n# Block Sorenson Squeeze Activation\n127.0.0.1 reg.sorensonmedia.com\n\nThanks for choosing\n(C)hallenge (O)f (R)everse (E)ngineering!: CORE NEWS AND iNFOS: We are hiring!
