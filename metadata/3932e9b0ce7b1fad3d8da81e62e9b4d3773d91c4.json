But this time, the makers seem to have got their flavors right (partly).\r\nSai Dharam Tej is, of course, the title holder, Subramanyam, in a film that goes left, right, and center in telling how great the hero is. Heâ€™s the only large-hearted person in the drama. Regina Cassandra turns from a foolishly innocent girl into a lovable woman by the end of the film.\r\nRegina takes to heels the night before her wedding. Obviously, sheâ€™s in love with somebody else and this wedding in which sheâ€™s supposed to be the bride doesnâ€™t interest her. When we do get to know about the love of her life, the man for whom she ran away from her wedding, thereâ€™s no amount of sympathy for her foolishness. She lands up in the US to marry her boyfriend. At the airport when she meets him, she doesnâ€™t go in for a hug, even though he extends his arms to welcome her. For a moment there, her body language sends a signal like â€œWeâ€™re not married yet. You are not getting a hug, honey.â€ Later on, she leans in for a big hug with the Supreme Hero â€“ Sai Dharam Tej, who is her good friend now. Well, where did the shyness or whatever it was, go? So, heroineâ€™s hugs or even seductive comedy for that matter is reserved only for the hero?\r\nBrahmanandam surprisingly isnâ€™t funny in the latter portions. This is because we have been seeing him repeat the act for nearly ten years. Though his face changes from one emoticon to another constantly, it doesnâ€™t serve any purpose. This is negated by a large supporting cast who work toward a single goal of making us laugh. Every time Fish Venkat utters an English word, you canâ€™t stop yourself from laughing. Rao Ramesh is the best of the lot. I have never seen him play a buffoon before. Heâ€™s a funny villain in â€˜Subramanyam for Saleâ€™; funnier than Brahmanandam actually.\r\nIf the hero is a member of the Mega family, references to Chiranjeevi and Pawan Kalyan are inevitable. Tejâ€™s energy is matched with Reginaâ€™s affable charm. Yes, the on-screen chemistry does work well. In the last 15 minutes of the film, all the problems of the couple, Subramanyam and Seetha, are unchained together. And in the final moment, the goodness of Subramanyam, wins everybody over. Likewise everybody in the movie, from Rao Ramesh to Jhansi, the menacing stepmom of Tej, become crying boxes. They realize that their Subramanyam is one man in a thousand.\r\nâ€˜Subramanyam for Saleâ€™ despite its staidness in telling makes for a comfortable watch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3932e9b0ce7b1fad3d8da81e62e9b4d3773d91c4","amp;dn":"Subramanyam+For+Sale+2015+Telugu+DvDscr+AAC-SSM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3932e9b0ce7b1fad3d8da81e62e9b4d3773d91c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,50,233,176,206,123,31,173,61,141,168,30,98,233,180,211,119,61,145,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
