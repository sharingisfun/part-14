I\\'ve never uploaded anything before, so I probably fucked something up. :) ... but I had to do it cauz' I knew that a lot of people were looking for it...\n\nI\\'m not exactly a hard core gamer, and even if I do decide to play something, I\\\\\\'m better off playing with mouse and keyboard... having said that...\nI did use Xbox emulator few times, some games are just made for a Pad.\n\nSo I used my old PS2 controller with the Xinput x360ce emulator, or some others, but I couldn\\\\'t get the rumble pack working, and a shitload of other people were looking for some fix...\nThat\\\\\\'s why I\\\\\\'m uploading those drivers... I don\\\\\\'t even know where I got them from. It was Just a little mini-disc. I probably had it for quite some time without knowing it, but I was looking thru my old CD\\\\\\'s for an old driver and I saw IT...\n\n\n\n... bottom line is... I\\\\'ve installed them and they work, and what\\'s more, they work with XInputTest.exe emulator too!!!\n\nI\\\\\\'ve tested them on XP x86 and Win7x64, with one original PS2 Pad and one aftermarket...\n\n...after installing it, it ads one extra tab in your control panel~~~&gt;game controllers app, just for the vibration test. Or just run the \\\\\\&quot;XInputTest.exe\\\\\\&quot;, that I threw in there... \n\n\nWhat else...?   ... If you\\\\\\'re worried about viruses and whatnot, you can feel safe, because beside my moral standing, I lack necessary skills to make stuff like that :) .\n\n\n\nAll right guys... Enjoy.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3ba175e76d45acee3fcc12b90f2aaf83a4aa20e","amp;dn":"Xshock+PS2+rumble+pack+drivers%2BXinput+Xbox+emulator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3ba175e76d45acee3fcc12b90f2aaf83a4aa20e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,186,23,94,118,212,90,206,227,252,193,43,144,242,170,248,58,74,162,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
