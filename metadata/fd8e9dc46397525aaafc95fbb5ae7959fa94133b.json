Mai nicknames Kazuya Shibuya &quot;Naru&quot; because of his narcissistic attitude, and the nickname is generally adopted by all those who come to eventually work with SPR: a Buddhist monk, Houshou Takigawa; a shrine maiden, Ayako Matsuzaki; a famous psychic, Masako Hara; and Catholic Priest, John Brown.\n\nGhost Hunt also explores the paranormal abilities of the characters, particularly focusing on Mai's &quot;latent psychic abilities,&quot; demonstrated by her dreaming about information relevant to their cases. She is often joined in her dreams by someone who she assumes to be Naru acting as a spirit guide, but who is later revealed to be someone quite unexpected. \n \n\nwe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img89/9629/aw7nnyg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img89/9629/aw7nnyg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders,AliBaloch, AllEncoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers - Contact Us @\n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd8e9dc46397525aaafc95fbb5ae7959fa94133b","amp;dn":"Ghost+Hunt+English+Dubbed+1-25+Complete+sum1_here+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd8e9dc46397525aaafc95fbb5ae7959fa94133b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,142,157,196,99,151,82,90,170,252,149,251,181,174,121,89,250,148,19,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
