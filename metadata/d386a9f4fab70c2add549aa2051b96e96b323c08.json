If this aspect of WW2 history is of interest to you, it's a great intro or summary. The book starts of with a good potted bio of Marshall Carl Gustav Mannerheim, the Finnish military commander and one of the truly outstanding generals of WW2 (and one of the greatest &quot;defensive&quot; generals of all time), covers the the 1939-40 Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland, then German invasions of Denmark and Norway. Again, with a very good overview of the fighting in Norway and the French-English intervention force","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d386a9f4fab70c2add549aa2051b96e96b323c08","amp;dn":"Battles+For+Scandinavia+%28Time-Life+World+War+II+Series%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d386a9f4fab70c2add549aa2051b96e96b323c08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,134,169,244,250,183,12,42,221,84,154,162,5,27,150,233,107,50,60,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
