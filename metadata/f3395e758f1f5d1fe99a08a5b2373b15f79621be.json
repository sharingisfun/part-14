Don't get on my ass about the sound being out of sync...you can read about the dvd here:  \n\nhttp://www.michaeldvd.com.au/Reviews/Reviews.asp?ID=5040\n\nIf you read on, you'll see that:\n\n&quot;The German dialogue is always prominent in the soundtrack and is rarely dominated by the score. The dialogue was entirely re-recorded in post production, and rarely matches the lips of the actors. I've heard speculation that many films from this era were recorded with no use of location audio whatsoever, which explains the terrible sync issues found here.&quot;\n\nSo it's not me! Ok? ;)  Unless you speak German, it shouldn't bother you anyway.\n\nThis movie has tremendous camp value...have fun!  Just be lucky that you can see such a good bad movie.\n\nExternal English subs in VOBsub format.\n\n----\n\nMini Plot:\n\nLucy is a young American lawyer, working in a law office in Istanbul. During the night, she has passionate dreams in which a sexy brunette harasses, and makes love to her, from which she's unable to defend herself. A minor case about an inheritance forces her to travel to one of the small islands off the Turkish coast. Then, her nightmares come upon her - in a lively manner.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nBitrate: 947 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x368 = 1.74:1\nAudio: English, 128 kb/s VBR AVG Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: English, External - VOBsub Format\nRuntime: 01:29:14\nFPS: 23.976\n\n----\n\nIf you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:\n\nNow at Beta 2!\n\nhttp://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta2-04042005.exe\n\nFor top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn\non (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of\nXviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.\n\nIf you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing.
