In the standalone spin-off to All Zombies Must Die!, the\nonly thing that really matters is your score. Build your multiplier\nand rack up as many kills as possible to become the best\nzombie-slayer in Deadhill; to that end, your mission remains the\nsame: all zombies must die\n\nAs well infesting familiar locations such as Town Square, Shopping\nMall and Surburbia, the undead have ambled their way into all new\nareas of Deadhill: the Military Base and Graveyard. In their bid to\nturn the world into a race of shuffling corpses, the zombies have\nstepped things up a gear for Scorepocalypse. McJagger will have to\ntake on three new flavours of the undead: Soldier, Necro and Ghost\nOur stoic hero shouldn t be too concerned, however, there are two\nnew weapons to help send the shufflers packing: Mini-gun and Rocket\nLauncher. Your score is based on a combination of two multipliers\none of which increases as you complete quests that appear\norganically as you play, and the other based on how many\nenvironmental modifiers you ve managed to apply to the undead. Use\nfire, shock, sonic and radiation and the environments themselves\nto your full advantage, and get the highest score possible!\n\n1. Unzip &amp; Unrar\n2.
