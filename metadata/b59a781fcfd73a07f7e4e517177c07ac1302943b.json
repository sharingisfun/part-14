Why all this emptiness despite our wealth?\n\nErik Gandini's approach through Surplus is to portray this issue from \nan emotional rather than a factual perspective. Shot in the US, India, \nChina, Italy, Sweden, Hungary, Canada and Cuba during three years. \nSurplus is the result of a complicated editing process by talented music \ncomposer/editor/percussionist Johan SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶derberg.\n\nGeorge W Bush's famous &quot;shopping-speech&quot; calling for a war against \nterrorism that deters the nation from the fear of consumption. Castro \nresponding with hymns to the anti-consumerist, advertising-free island of \nCuba. Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer preaching that the computer will give \nus peace on earth &quot;bringing people together&quot; while Adbuster Kalle Lasn \nwarns that advertising pollutes us mentally, that over-consumption is \nunsustainable and that we are running out of oil.\n\nSurplus main man is John Zerzan, controversial philosopher whose call for \nPROPERTY DAMAGE has inspired many to take to the streets. &quot;That is not \nviolence. Sitting there doing dope and watching MTV . Then you go and get \na job. Just schlep along. To me that is violence,&quot; says Zerzan. &quot;We are \nterrorized into being consumers.&quot;\n\nIn November 2003 Surplus was awarded with the most prestigious prize a \nDocumentary can get, The Silver Wolf at Amsterdam's IDFA, and has spread \nwidely around the globe since then.\n\nAwards 2003-2004\n\n-First prize at the 2003 IDFA-Amsterdam Silver Wolf Competition.\n-Nominated for the 2003 Guldbaggen, the &quot;Swedish Oscar&quot;, as best documentary film.\n-Award best use of sound and music at the 2004 One World documentary Film Festival, Prague Czech Republic.\n-Jurys mention at the 2004 DocAviv, Documentary Film Festival, Tel Aviv, Israel.\n-Second best short film at the 2004 Ecocinema International Film Festival, Rhodes, Greece\n-First prize as &quot;greatest of all productions&quot; at 2004 FICA, the International Festival of Environmental Film, Goias, Brazil.\n-Audience Award at Vila do Conte, International Short Film Festival , Portugal, July 2004.\n-Two Special Mentions at the Torino Environmental Film Festival, October 2004  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368314/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368314/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMore related material: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b59a781fcfd73a07f7e4e517177c07ac1302943b","amp;dn":"Surplus-Terrorized.Into.Being.Consumers.2003.NTSC.DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b59a781fcfd73a07f7e4e517177c07ac1302943b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,154,120,31,207,215,58,7,247,228,229,23,23,124,7,172,19,2,148,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
