Katz\nBedford/St. Martins | July 2010 | 776 Pages | ISBN: 0312542623 | PDF | 24.6 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Writing-Now-2009-2010-Updates/dp/0312542623&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Writing-Now-2009-2010-Updates/dp/0312542623&lt;/a&gt;\n\n'Writing Now' helps students connect the visually rich texts they read every day with strategies for college writing. Focusing on six real-world genres -- memoirs, profiles, reports, position papers, evaluations, and proposals -- students learn to read words, images, and design with a critical eye, decoding the writer's choices about audience and purpose. To highlight the visual elements, many of the 39 contemporary readings are laid out as they originally appeared when published. Within the writing guide for each genre-based assignment, friendly advice in an innovative visual format gives students practical strategies for tackling each task in the writing process. Extensive guidance on research and design, along with coverage of portfolios, oral presentations, and other writing situations make this the one textbook students need, when they need more than words.\n\nAbout the Authors\nLEE ODELL is professor of composition in the Department of Language, Literature, and Communication at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
