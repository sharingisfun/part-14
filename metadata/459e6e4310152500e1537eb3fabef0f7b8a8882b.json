In addition to his &quot;All Stars&quot; band, which included Edgar Winter and Rick Derringer this year, Ringo was joined onstage, at the end of his concert, by dozens of his friends and family members -- including famous musicians, music biz execs, and John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono. Ringo thanked us and said good night and everyone left the stage, the lights were dimmed once more... seconds later emerged Ringo's old friend and band-mate, Paul McCartney, flanked by the The Eagle's (and Jame's Gang) Superstar, Joe Walsh, Edgar Winter an Rick Derringer. Paul then launched into a rocking and rollicking version of the Beatles &quot;Birthday,&quot; in honor or good ol' Ringo. Apparently Ringo was not expecting Paul and had to scramble back to his drum set to join in. And there it was... an extremely rare 1/2 Beatles reunion (I got great photos of that which will be posted soon -- stay tuned).\n\nAfter the concert, all of the celebs and Ringo's friends and family went across the street for a party at &quot;Top of the Sixes.&quot; An hour and a half later they began to stream out, including the man of the hour, Ringo Starr himself (who looked great and put on a great show for us), George Harrison's widow, Olivia Harrison and many others (Yoko Ono had been whisked away in a limo after the concert and did not attend the party). One of the lastto leave the party was none other than this gentleman above. The one we were all waiting for. However, I seem to have now forgotten his name.\n\nAt the end of the concert, Paul and Ringo shared a tender, public moment as they hugged... and from far away I do believe I saw the glistening of happy tears in both men's eyes. Not only had I seen a great concert put on by Ringo and his pals, but I had just seen an extremely rare 1/2 Beatles Reunion.\n\nIn this photo, Paul is seen leaving Ringo's birthday party. Right behind him is his girlfriend, Nancy Shevell. Moment's after this photo was taken, I scored a surprise &quot;High-Five&quot; from Paul as he leaned out of his window to say goodbye to his fans.
