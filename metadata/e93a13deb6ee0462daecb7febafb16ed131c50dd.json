Modern Cryptography \n    is an indispensable resource for every advanced student of cryptography \n    who intends to implement strong security in real-world applications. \n\n    Leading HP security expert Wenbo Mao explains why conventional crypto \n    schemes, protocols, and systems are profoundly vulnerable, introducing \n    both fundamental theory and real-world attacks. Next, he shows how to \n    implement crypto systems that are truly &quot;fit for application,&quot; and \n    formally demonstrate their fitness. \n\n    He begins by reviewing the foundations of cryptography: probability, \n    information theory, computational complexity, number theory, algebraic \n    techniques, and more. He presents the &quot;ideal&quot; principles of \n    authentication, comparing them with real-world implementation. \n\n    Mao assesses the strength of IPSec, IKE, SSH, SSL, TLS, Kerberos, and \n    other standards, and offers practical guidance on designing stronger \n    crypto schemes and using formal methods to prove their security and \n    efficiency. Finally, he presents an in-depth introduction to \n    zero-knowledge protocols: their characteristics, development, \n    arguments, and proofs. Mao relies on practical examples throughout, \n    and provides all the mathematical background students will need.\n\n    +------------------------[  N O T I C E  ]----------------------------+\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n+-|-|-Ã‚Â¨ Ã‚Â¨  Ã‚Â·                                                       Ã‚Â·  Ã‚Â¨ Ã‚Â¨-|-|-+\n| | |                                                                     | | |\n| |     So little hate, so much time.
