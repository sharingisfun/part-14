Third Annual Pipe Dream showed them stretching out the meaning of &quot;Southern rock,&quot; while A Rock and Roll Alternative was their commercial breakthrough -- either body of songs is worth owning and worth hearing more than once. \n\n Bruce Eder, All Music Guide\n\n\nThis album is the quintensental Southern Rock Album! It has everything from the bluegrass sound in Doraville to the hard hitting southern blues of Blues in Maude's flat. Angel really provides the focus for the vocal talent of Ronnie Hammond. Who you gonna run to combines his vocals with a sweet southern blues riff.\n\nRock and Roll Alternative has several pop top 40 tunes that you will remember like Sky High, Georgia Rhythm, So Into You, and Neon Nights.\n\nThe real diamond is Third Annual Pipe Dream This album was a part of my collection for years until it was lost in a move.
