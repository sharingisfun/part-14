Although called &quot;the most anti-Semitic country in Europe,&quot; why did Romania's Jews survive the Holocaust in greater numbers than others?\n\nThis folder contains both the original PDF - which is browseable and searchable - as well as the converted EPUB from Calibre, which is certainly readable on a tablet or similar device but has formatting issues due to the original being a scanned copy of the book itself. The generated metadata.opf file and front cover are also included.
