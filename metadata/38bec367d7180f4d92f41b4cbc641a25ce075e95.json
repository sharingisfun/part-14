But Errol's father has been dead for years. Late one night, curious and a little unnerved, Errol sneaks into the graveyard where his father is buried. The man he finds there will change his life. Soon Errol's on the run from mad scientists and homeland security death squads, and befriended by creatures that are the stuff of nightmares.
