Sosia Camillina is on the run from a couple of street toughs, and after rescuing her, Falco wants to find out why. It soon becomes clear that Sosia knows a dangerous secret about a stockpile of silver ingots - or &amp;#039;pigs&amp;#039; - and there are those who will stop at nothing to prevent her telling what she knows. Hoping for future favours from Sosia&amp;#039;s rich, influential uncle, Falco embarks on an intricate case of smuggling, murder and treason that reaches as far as the Emperor&amp;#039;s palace, and beyond the seven hills of Rome. Soon, Falco finds himself in an inhospitable outpost of the Empire called Britain, where the weather is filthy, the natives restless and the women angry. There, he meets Helena Justina, a spirited aristocrat who becomes an important part of his life. But, if he does not tread carefully, the treacherous puzzle of the silver pigs could be the death of him...\n\nEpisode 1:\n----------\nOur hero chances upon an illegal trade in precious metal, the silver pigs of the title, after rescuing a senator&amp;#039;s daughter from a kidnap gang.\n\nEpisode 2:\n----------\nThings have taken a turn for the worse and he now finds himself investigating a murder, and, worse still, is forced to visit a remote and dangerous outpost of the Empire - Britain.\n\nEpisode 3:\n----------\nInvestigating the illegal import of the silver pigs or ingots, the Roman Detective Falco has chanced upon a plot to overthrow the Emperor Vespasian.\n\nEpisode 4:\n----------\nIn the final episode of our Roman detective adventure, Falco discovers the identity of Sosia&amp;#039;s murderer, unmasks the identity of the plotters against the Emperor and finds that true love can cross the boundaries of the strict Roman class structure.\n\nDirected by:\n------------\nPeter Leslie Wilde\n\nWith:\n-----\nFalco....Anton Lesser\nHelena....Fritha Goodey\nAelia....Susan Jeffrey\nDecimus....Robert Lister \nDomitian....Declan Wilson\nFalco&amp;#039;s Mother....Frances Jeater\nGaius Hilaris....Ian Brooker\nLenia....Gillian Goodman\nMarcia....Helen Monks\nPertinax/Julius....Sean Connolly\nPetronius....Ben Crowe\nPublius....Richard Derrington\nSosia....Felicity Jones\nTitus....Jonathan Keeble\nTriferus / Cornix....Alex Jones\nVespasian....Michael Tudor Barnes\n\n-----------------------\nType : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate : 128\nMode : joint stereo\nFrequency : 44100 Hz\nEncoder : Lame 3.95\n-----------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78fe18330e8e04e7651ff6ada665f85cb35112b2","amp;dn":"Falco+-+The+Silver+Pigs+-+A+Detective+Story+from+Ancient+Rome+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78fe18330e8e04e7651ff6ada665f85cb35112b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,254,24,51,14,142,4,231,101,31,246,173,166,101,248,92,179,81,18,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
