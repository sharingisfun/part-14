Guelzo Gettysburg College Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania\n\nJohn Locke Scripps, who had convinced Lincoln to write his first campaign autobiography, asserted that the 16th president had become &quot;the Great American ManÃ¢â‚¬â€the grand central figure in American (perhaps the World's) History.&quot; Historians still find it hard to quibble with this opinion of Lincoln's place in the story of America. Lincoln was the central figure in the nation's greatest crisis, the Civil War. His achievements in office make as good a case as any that he was the greatest president in U.S. history.\nWhat made Lincoln great? What was it about him that struck those who knew him? This course explores those questions with the help of an authority who, in his own words, has &quot;spent many years trying to get to know this man from afar,&quot; and in doing so has become one of the country's most distinguished Lincoln scholars and an award-winning author for his books about Lincoln.\n\nProfessor Allen C. Guelzo will lead you on &quot;a great adventure,&quot; a tour of Lincoln's life, from his forebears' arrival in America through an evaluation of how his legacy lives on for us today. You will come to know Lincoln through the eyes of those who knew, lived with, and worked with him.\n\nFor Lincoln buffs and those simply wishing to know him much better, this course opens a compelling view into his thinking and career.\n\nIn addition to asking what it was like to know Lincoln, Professor Guelzo explores three themes:\n\nWhat ideas were at the core of his understanding of American politics?\nWhy did he oppose slavery, and what propelled him, in the 1850s, into the open opposition to slavery that led to his election to the presidency in 1860?\nWhat particular gifts equipped Lincoln to lead the nation through the &quot;fiery trial&quot; of the Civil War?\n\n01 - Young Man Lincoln\n02 - Whig Meteor\n03 - Lincoln, Law, and Politics\n04 - The Mind of Abraham Lincoln\n05 - Lincoln and Slavery\n06 - The Great Debates\n07 - Lincoln and Liberty, Too\n08 - The Uncertain President\n09 - The Emancipation Moment\n10 - LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Triumph\n11 - The PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sword\n12 - The Dream of Lincoln\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75484ec7f9152963a8f0134208a80c7d70e47384","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Mr.+Lincoln+-+The+Life+of+Abraham+Lincoln","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75484ec7f9152963a8f0134208a80c7d70e47384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,72,78,199,249,21,41,99,168,240,19,66,8,168,12,125,112,228,115,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
