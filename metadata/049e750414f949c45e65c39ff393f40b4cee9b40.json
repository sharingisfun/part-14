It was a black-and-white newsstand publication in a magazine format and thus did not require the approval or seal of the Comics Code Authority.  The anthology magazine was initially published quarterly but later went bimonthly. Each issue's stories were introduced by the host character, Uncle Creepy.\n\nRuss Jones, the founding editor of Creepy but left in 1965 and Archie Goodwin became the editor of Creepy. Goodwin, who became one of comics' foremost and most influential writers, helped to establish the company as a major force in its field.  Artists during this era included Neal Adams, Dan Adkins, Reed Crandall, Johnny Craig, Steve Ditko, Frank Frazetta, Gray Morrow, John Severin, Angelo Torres, Alex Toth, Al Williamson and Wally Wood. Originally published quarterly, Creepy switched to bi-monthly by the end of 1965.\nGoodwin resigned as the editor of Creepy after issue 17 (October 1967). Due to a lack of funds, the majority of the magazine's leading artists left, and Warren was forced to rely on reprints, which would be prevalent in the magazine until issue 32 in April 1970. A variety of editors ran the magazine during this period, including Bill Parente, Nicola Cuti and Warren himself. Things would pick up starting in 1969 with the premiere of Vampirella magazine. Some of Creepy's original artists, including Frazetta, Crandall and Wood, would return, as did Goodwin, who was associate editor for issues 35 through 39.\n\nA variety of editors continued to manage Creepy after Goodwin's second departure, including Billy Graham and J. R. Cochran. William Dubay, who had started at Warren as an artist with issue 32 in 1970 would become editor of the magazine for issues 50 through 78, except for a short period of time in 1974 where Goodwin returned for issues 61 through 64. During this period the frequency of Creepy and Warren's other magazines was upped to nine issues per year.\nAnother major development occurred in late 1971 when artists from the Barcelona Studio of Spanish agency Selecciones Illustrada started appearing in Creepy and other Warren magazines. Artists from Spain would go on to dominate Creepy and the other Warren magazines throughout the 1970s. These artists included Esteban Maroto, Jaime Brocal, Rafael Aura LeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n, Martin Salvador, Luis GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a, Fernando FernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez, JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez, JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Bea, Isidro MonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, Manuel SanjuliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n and Enrich Torres. Additional artists from S.I.'s Valencia Studio joined Warren in 1974 including JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Ortiz, Luis Bermejo, and Leopold SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nchez. Notable writers during Dubay's era as editor included Gerry Boudreau, Budd Lewis, Jim Stenstrum, Steve Skeates and Doug Moench.\nThemed specials dominated Dubay's era as editor, and included two Edgar Allan Poe issues (69 and 70), three Christmas issues (59, 68 and 77), three issues dedicated to a single artist (71, 72 and 74), a science fiction issue (73) and an issue where every story was based on the cover painting (64). This era also featured stories that were printed in color, many of which were done by Richard Corben. Towards the end of his period as editor, many artists from Creepy's first golden era returned, including Alex Toth and John Severin.\n\nDubay resigned after issue 78 and was replaced by Louise Jones, his former assistant. Jones would edit the magazine until issue 116 in March 1980. Former DC Comics publisher Carmine Infantino joined Warren shortly after she became editor and did pencils for over 50 stories. Much like the wave of Spanish artists that dominated Creepy throughout the mid-1970s, a number of artists from the Philippines joined Warren during her period as editor, including Alex NiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o, Alfredo Alcala and Rudy Nebres, remaining with Creepy until its end in 1983. While he had resigned as editor, Dubay remained with Warren and became their dominant writer during this period. Other dominant writers during this period included Bruce Jones, Bob Toomey, and Roger McKenzie.\n\nAfter Louise Jones resigned as editor following issue 116, Dubay returned to edit the magazine using the alias &quot;Will Richardson&quot; until issue 126. After Dubay's departure, various editors including Chris Adames and Timothy Moriarty held the position. Reprints would once again start predominantly appearing in the magazine, with many reprint issues being dedicated to a single artist. Jim Warren's last Creepy (#145) was published February 1983, and then he went bankrupt. Harris Publications bought rights after Warren's bankruptcy and published a single issue (#146) in 1985.\n\nIn 2000, after a protracted legal dispute with Harris Publications, Jim Warren and Warren Publishing finally regained sole ownership of all rights to his two iconic and flagship comic book franchises Creepy and Eerie.\n\nIn July 2009, Dark Horse Comics and New Comic Company LLC released the new Creepy comic. The issue was edited by Shawna Gore with Dan Braun and Craig Haffern. Writers included Mike Woods, Dan Braun, Joe Harris, Saskia Gutekunst, and a Bill Dubay. Artists are Bernie Wrightson, Angelo Torres, Jason Alexander Smith.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:049e750414f949c45e65c39ff393f40b4cee9b40","amp;dn":"Creepy+%28Warren%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"049e750414f949c45e65c39ff393f40b4cee9b40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,158,117,4,20,249,73,196,94,101,195,159,243,147,244,11,76,238,155,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
