Therefore\none should not give up the work born of his nature, even if such work is full of fault.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Bhagvad-Gita (18.48)\n\nOFDM for wireless communications systems / Ramjee Prasad\n\n\nMy wireless (mobile) garden is full of flowers with varieties of flavors, for example,\nCDMA, OFDM, and so forth.\nLast year I realized my ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOFDM flowerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has become a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œparagonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with the successful\ncompletion of the work of of several masters, doctoral, and postdoctoral\ncandidates, for example Mohindar Jankiraman, Dusan Matic, Klaus Witrisal, Uma\nJha, Richard van Nee, Shinsuke Hara, Hiroshi Harada, and so on. Therefore, I\ndecided to put together in one place their interesting and valuable contributions,\nparticularly of those of Klaus, Jankiraman, Uma, and Richard.\nAlthough I coauthored OFDM for Wireless Multimedia Communications with\nRichard and Multicarrier Techniques for 4G Mobile Communications with Shinsuke,\nthis book is very different in that it presents an overview of the wireless local\narea network (WLAN), wireless personal area network (WPAN), frequencydomain\nchannel model, a novel hybrid OFDM concept, and a practical OFDM\nsystem.\nFigure P.1 illustrates the coverage of this book. This book illustrates the role of\nOFDM in developing an adaptive system by designing OFDM-based wireless wide\narea networks (WWANs), WLANs, and WPANs. It is based on the contributions of\nseveral researchers who had or have been actively involved in growing the OFDM\nflower in the wireless (mobile) garden under my gardenership.\nAs a gardener, I have tried my best to provide enough water and energy to nurture\nthe OFDM flower up until this point. In the future, it will sow several other\ninteresting colors, which I will bring to you at that time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f1d35928ace6035a9884eb454c318cee06651c","amp;dn":"Artech+House+-+OFDM+For+Wireless+Communications+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f1d35928ace6035a9884eb454c318cee06651c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,241,211,89,40,172,230,3,90,152,132,235,69,76,49,140,238,6,101,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
