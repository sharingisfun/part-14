Seeking payback for his humiliating loss, Sebulba has a new beefed-up Podracer and lust for revenge. But it's not going to be easy: Anakin has grown into a boldly skilled Podracer pilot. Thus the stage is set for Star Wars? Racer Revenge?, bringing newer, faster, and even more dangerous Podracing to the galaxy-taking you on a one-way ride to ultimate victory. Jockey for position with a tangle of Podracing opponents or leave the pack behind at intense, nerve-jangling, planet-scorching simulated speeds of up to 600 mph. Crash and bash competitors into oblivion as you take them out of the race for good.\n\n\nDo you missing a game? Write a comment with the game you want and I will try to upload that game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e2a8d394210f105bb4650a06c9f5d4a5e23340","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Racer+Revenge+%5BPS2%5D+%5BPAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e2a8d394210f105bb4650a06c9f5d4a5e23340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,226,168,211,148,33,15,16,91,180,101,10,6,201,245,212,165,226,51,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
