Intended as a spoof of the common &quot;women in prison&quot; genre, it follows a sadistic female prison warden who sexually abuses the lesbian inmates, and features numerous gratuitous sex scenes between the prisoners and prison employees. The film was banned in the United Kingdom after independent film distributor Redemption_Films attempted to distribute the film in 1994, and X-rated in the United States due to its graphic depiction of coercive sex.\n\nIn a prison, women rebel against the guards' sadism and sexual abuse and decide to run away. Some manage to escape and are chased by the Police. \n\nIt was released on DVD by Blue Underground on 30 May 2006.\n\n\nDirector: Oswaldo de Oliveira\n\nWriter:Oswaldo de Oliveira\n\nStars:Maria Stella Splendore, Marta Anderson, Danielle Ferrite\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c014ffb8b19790447c5b321a5115b9129351b43","amp;dn":"Bare+Behind+Bars+-+sexploitation+women+in+prison+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c014ffb8b19790447c5b321a5115b9129351b43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,1,79,251,139,25,121,4,71,197,179,33,165,17,91,145,41,53,27,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
