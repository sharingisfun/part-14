The open house is slow, but when her last visitor pulls up in a van as she's about to leave, Annie thinks it just might be her lucky day after all. Interwoven with the story of the year Annie spent as the captive of a psychopath in a remote mountain cabin, which unfolds through sessions with her psychiatrist, is a second narrative recounting events following her escape - her struggle to piece her shattered life back together and the ongoing police investigation into the identity of her captor. The truth doesn't always set you free. Still Missing is that rare debut find - a shocking, visceral, brutal, and beautifully crafted novel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e291b09c60c462f4bd540c91cb08321423a954","amp;dn":"Chevy+Stevens+-+Still+Missing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e291b09c60c462f4bd540c91cb08321423a954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,226,145,176,156,96,196,98,244,189,84,12,145,203,8,50,20,35,169,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
