It started out\n    as a normal day where Howard and the crew were discussing his sexual close\n    encounter with Pamela Anderson.  The mood of the show goes from a fun time\n    in the studio to a complete disaster of terrorist attacks and mass panic.\n    Howard stayed on the air throughout the entire incident to give a real\n    look and opinion on the attacks as well as raw emotion from those calling\n    in to the show such as Crazy Cabby, Zolar, and Joey Boots.\n\n    No other coverage compared to the extremely real emotion that was invoked\n    by the cast and callers.  The crew was able to speculate and try and peice\n    together the events to form some sort of opinion on what exactly was going\n    on.  I remember this show very clearly as I am a New Yorker and was tuned \n    in this entire day.  The anger I felt was leveled by the true anger that\n    Howard and the crew showed.  It was really a place to vent and feel more\n    safe knowing that others were feeling the same way.\n             \n    This is a true testament to the importance of the Howard Stern Show and\n    is probably one of the most drama filled days in the history of it.  No\n    other show compared to the craziness that went on that day.  I remember\n    that it took awhile before they actually aired this Howard TV episode\n    because they certainly did not air it anytime soon after the actual day\n    it all occured.  It's a great special and well put together and definitely\n    is something all Stern fan's would love to see again.  If you never heard\n    or saw this at all then you really need to see it!\n\n\n\n\n Lineage: Howard Stern On Demand &gt; Pinnacle HDTV Capture Card &gt; 640x480 .avi\n                       Edited For The True Stern Fan.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13203c4dfb5601b9d7d472aa96df436b76de622e","amp;dn":"Howard+TV+-+September+11%2C+2001+Retrospective%28wush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13203c4dfb5601b9d7d472aa96df436b76de622e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,32,60,77,251,86,1,185,215,212,114,170,150,223,67,107,118,222,98,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
