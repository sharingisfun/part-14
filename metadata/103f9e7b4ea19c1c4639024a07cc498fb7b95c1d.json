When a married print is created, this frame \nis slightly re-cropped by the frame line and optical soundtrack down to Academy \nratio (1.37:1). The movie projector then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the \nAcademy frame to the intended aspect ratio (1.85:1 or 1.66:1). When the 4:3 \nfullscreen video master is created, many filmmakers may prefer to use the full \nAcademy frame (open matte) instead of creating a pan and scan version from \nwithin the 1.85 framing. Because the framing is increased vertically in the open \nmatte process, the decision to use it needs to be made prior to shooting, so \nthat the camera operator can frame for 1.85:1 and &quot;protect&quot; for 4:3; otherwise \nunintended objects such as boom microphones, cables, and light stands may appear \nin the open matte frame, thus requiring some amount of pan and scan in some or \nall scenes. Additionally, the unmatted 4:3 version will often throw off an \notherwise tightly-framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above \nactors (particularly with 1.85:1).\n\nThe standardization of widescreen TVs and the growing use of 3-perforation 35mm \nfilm (with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1) to save on film costs has made the open \nmatte process less popular in recent years.

For the accomplishment of this goal, the outstanding scientists in the \nfield have been recruited by a character named Exeter, who has set up a \ncompletely-equipped laboratory in Georgia.\n\nOne of the most thrilling sequences occurs as huge meteors attack the space ship \nas it is working its way to Metaluna. Ingeniously-constructed props and \nequipment, together with strange sound effects also are responsible for \nfurthering interest, which is of the edge-of-the-seat variety during the latter \nhalf of the film. For an added fillip, there&amp;#039;s a Mutant, half human, half \ninsect, which boards the ship as it escapes from Metaluna.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssemble your Interociter...\n\nExeter would have only one rival for Most Compelling Alien of the Fifties; that \nwould be Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still). The differences between the two \nare profound. From the moment he appears, Klaatu is an arresting presence, an \nadvanced being even at his most humane. Exeter, in contrast, comes from a \ntechnologically advanced culture, but he is very human: emotional, powerless to \nresist fate, but resilient and optimistic in the face of total destruction, a \nsymbol of ethical perseverance. Side by side they serve as a reminder that \nhumanity can aspire to more than one goal. One question the film doesn&amp;#039;t answer: \nWere there more Exeters on Metaluna, or was he unique?\n\nAs with Klaatu, the performance of Exeter is crucial. Morrow strikes the right \nnote: His dignified, soulful portrayal lays this alien bare for the audience. At \nfirst, This Island Earth slyly packages itself as Meacham&amp;#039;s story; but bit by \nbit Exeter takes over the film from this square-jawed, deep-voiced, \ntwo-dimensional scientist-cum-hero. Reason and Domergue do a fine job with their \nforgettable roles; nonetheless Exeter is much the more interesting character. \n(The supporting cast includes poor Russell Johnson in another role later \novershadowed by his unfortunate three-hour tour.)\n\nThe art direction and special effects--always trumpeted as two and a half years \nin the making--are superb, and not just for 1954. Tremendous effort went into \ncommunicating the scale of destruction on Metaluna, which is mutilated by \nmeteors remote-controlled from enemy spacecraft. (Brilliantly, the barely \nglimpsed Zahgon ships look harsh and alien even from the standpoint of the \nMetalunans.) Yet the creators had the sense to remember that the purpose of \neffects is setting. The people behind today&amp;#039;s effects-obsessed science fiction \ndreadnoughts need to see This Island Earth immediately. \nScifi.com\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 PLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck you have installed the right codecs, as listed in this .nfo file, before\ntrying to play it.
