It provoked a storm of controversy when it was released in Russia. Russian military and security bodies were horrified by claims the story was true. The Federal Security Service, successor to the KGB, said no such mission ever took place, and war veterans condemned it as an insult to the memory and sacrifice of real Red Army heroes.\n\nAt the awards ceremony there was a heated moment amongst believers and non believers that the event ever took place \n\nMy upload pages at SB &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n Director: Aleksandr Atanesyan \n\n\n\n Andrey Panin ...
