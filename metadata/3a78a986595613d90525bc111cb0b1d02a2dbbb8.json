The album was released on October 17, 1968. It was later reissued by Repertoire Records and included ten more tracks.\n\nThe Easybeats were a rock and roll band from Australia. They formed in Sydney in late 1964 and split at the end of 1969. They are widely regarded as the greatest Australian pop band of the 1960s and were the first Australian rock and roll act to score an international pop hit with their classic 1966 single &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; (the folk-pop group, The Seekers, had international hits in 1965). Their manager was former Sydney real estate agent, Mike Vaughan.\nThe band's line-up exemplified the influence of post-war migration on Australian society. All five founding members were from families who had migrated to Australia from Europe: lead singer Stevie Wright and drummer Gordon &quot;Snowy&quot; Henry Fleet were from England; rhythm guitarist George Young was from Scotland; lead guitarist Harry Vanda and bassist Dick Diamonde were from The Netherlands.\n\nTracklist:\n01. &quot;Good Times&quot; (Harry Vanda, George Young) - 3:23\n02. &quot;See Saw&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 2:39\n03. &quot;Fancy Seeing You Here&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 2:36\n04. &quot;Sha La La La Leah&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 3:11\n05. &quot;What in the World&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 2:18\n06. &quot;Bring a Little Lovin'&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 2:25\n07. &quot;Land of Make Believe&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 3:13\n08. &quot;We All Live Happily&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 4:05\n09. &quot;Falling off the Edge of the World&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 3:00\n10. &quot;The Music Goes Round My Head&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 2:51\n11. &quot;Come in You'll Get Pneumonia&quot; (Vanda, Young, Tony Cahill) - 3:46\n12. &quot;Hello How Are You&quot; (Vanda, Young) - 3:20\n(CD Bonus Tracks)\n13. &quot;Can't Take My Eyes off You&quot; - 3:35\n14. &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot; - 2:57\n15. &quot;I Can't Stand It&quot; - 2:57\n16. &quot;Good Times&quot; (Different Mix) - 3:22\n17. &quot;Lay Me Down and Die&quot; (Instrumental Version) - 3:02\n18. &quot;Lay Me Down and Die&quot; (Vocal Version) - 2:52\n19. &quot;Fast Version&quot; - 2:20\n20. &quot;Hello How Are You&quot; (Original First Version) - 4:03\n21. &quot;Come in You Pnuemonia&quot; (First Version) - 3:26\n22. &quot;Falling off the Edge of World&quot; (Second Version) - 2:36\nRunningtime: 01:07:59","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a78a986595613d90525bc111cb0b1d02a2dbbb8","amp;dn":"The+Easybeats+-+Vigil+%281968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a78a986595613d90525bc111cb0b1d02a2dbbb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,120,169,134,89,86,19,217,5,37,188,17,28,176,177,208,42,45,187,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
