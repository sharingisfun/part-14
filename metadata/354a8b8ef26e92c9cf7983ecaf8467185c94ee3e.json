He is mainly known as a member of the  progressive rock band Yes, supergroup Asia and new wave duo The Buggles,\r\n\r\n The year, both Trevor Horn and Downes joined Yes and recorded the album Drama as a part of the band. The following year however, Yes disbanded.\r\n\r\nGreg Lake, a school friend of Robert Fripp, was a founding member of King Crimson. Lake was primarily a guitarist, but agreed to switch to bass at Fripp's request. Lake had some involvement in writing the lyrics for King Crimson's debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King, although Peter Sinfield was the primary lyricist. Lake also ended up producing the album after their contracted producer, Tony Clarke, walked away from the project.\r\n\r\nIn The Court of the Crimson King, released in 1969, made King Crimson far more successful than any of Fripp and Lake's earlier projects. Lake's vocals, which ranged from serene and soothing to acerbic and distorted, were a striking element of the album. \r\nHowever, Lake stayed with King Crimson for only about a year, leaving soon after their debut album to start the rock trio Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Despite this, at Fripp's request, Lake sang on King Crimson's second album, In the Wake of Poseidon.\r\n\r\nDownes has also recorded a number of solo albums and collaborated with many other artists such as his then former bandmate John Wetton, former Deep Purple Glenn Hughes and Ride The Tiger with Greg Lake.\r\n GREG LAKE &amp; GEOFF DOWNES titled â€œRIDE THE TIGERâ€ has finally seen the light of day! Greg Lake is the co-founder of KING CRIMSON and EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER (ELP), and . Geoff Downes is the keyboardist in THE BUGGLES, ASIA and YES,â€.\r\n\r\nâ€œRide the Tigerâ€ contains six songs which the duo wrote together - one went on to became an ASIA song and two became ELP songs. Four of these tracks had been released on compilations before, but this is the FIRST TIME they have been collected together with TWO PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED tracks PLUS one alternate mix.\r\nOr in other words these two have so much history its not funny enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBUM: Ride The Tiger\r\n\r\nYEAR: 2015\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY: UK\r\n\r\nSTYLE: Progressive Rock\r\n\r\nLABEL: Manticore Records\r\n\r\nDURATION: 0:32:06\r\n\r\nFILE FORMAT: MP3\r\n\r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps\r\n\r\nSite:\tgeoffdownes.com \r\n\r\nSize: 74 MB (Files: 8) \r\n\r\n\r\n01.
