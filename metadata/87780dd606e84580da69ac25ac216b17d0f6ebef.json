What makes this CD stand out from his many similar dates is that Ken Peplowski's clarinet and tenor are well featured, adding variety to the music and a lead voice for Byrd to play off of. Otherwise the music is predictably excellent, with such classics as &quot;One Note Samba,&quot; &quot;Corcovado,&quot; &quot;Dindi,&quot; &quot;O Pato,&quot; and &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; receiving very favorable treatment.
