A policeman, Michael Colefield, is reluctantly drawn into the group after a confrontation with his 'turned' former best friend, Jack Beresford, when Michael, defending himself after being bitten, is forced to 'kill' Jack.\n\nStylish, dark and often humourous, Ultraviolet delivered a blend of vampire myth with a modern slant. It is notable that the programme never once mentions the word vampire, instead referring to the antagonists as 'leeches' or a 'code 5 infection'. \n\n\n6 episodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e191c0eecd2281e58ccda1a92b9ab39449ebc9ea","amp;dn":"Ultraviolet%2C+TV%2C+Complete+series.+better+torrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e191c0eecd2281e58ccda1a92b9ab39449ebc9ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,145,192,238,205,34,129,229,140,205,161,169,43,154,179,148,73,235,201,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
