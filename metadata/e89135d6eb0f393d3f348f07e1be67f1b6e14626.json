I could not have been more impressed - this is even more powerful than the book that I loved.\n\nIt is such a liberating experience to sit there and absorb the teaching as Tolle gently strips away the layers of illusion we mis-interpret as ourself. I have watched these DVD's on their entirety four times now, and each viewing is as fresh as the first time.\n\nThis is the most powerful spiritual teaching I have ever read or viewed - I cannot recommend it highly enough","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e89135d6eb0f393d3f348f07e1be67f1b6e14626","amp;dn":"Eckhart+Tolle+-+The+Flowering+of+Human+Consciousness+%5B2+DVD+-+ri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e89135d6eb0f393d3f348f07e1be67f1b6e14626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,145,53,214,235,15,57,61,63,52,143,7,225,190,103,241,182,225,70,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
