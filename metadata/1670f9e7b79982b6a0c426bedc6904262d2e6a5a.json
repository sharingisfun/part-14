Her seamless delivery and powerful, emotive style hearken back to the great stylists of an earlier era. Anyone having had the pleasure of hearing her, whether it be live, on the radio or on CD, will actually SEE the pictures she paints with her voice, FEEL the emotion in every note, and HEAR the traditional roots of the country music she was raised on. Her secret? &quot;There&amp;#039;s no secret, she says, &quot;I&amp;#039;ve been very Blessed with a wonderful gift. I love music and I love people. My goal is to combine the two - to try and touch the hearts of those I can&amp;#039;t see or may never meet - by bringing them back to a cherished memory or by putting a smile on the face of a stranger. It is said that music is a universal language. I simply want to share my gift with those willing to listen to what I hope will be a meaningful message.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1670f9e7b79982b6a0c426bedc6904262d2e6a5a","amp;dn":"Dawn+Sears+-+Dawn+Sears+%5B2005%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1670f9e7b79982b6a0c426bedc6904262d2e6a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,112,249,231,183,153,130,182,160,196,38,190,220,105,4,38,45,46,106,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
