If your ISP DOES count uploads then they most likely have on and off-peak service aswell SO say if your getting 30 gigs of downloads a month, your most likely getting 20gigs off-peak and 10gigs on-peak which means 20 gigs 12 at night - 7 in the morning and 10 gigs 7 in the morning - 12 at night SO just seed in the off-peak hours as this won't slow your internet down. i really don't see why it's such a problem. you don't get anything out of it, but it's what keeps torrents and sites like TPB alive so just do it.\n\n\n*Please also note that if you wanna watch it on the tv, chuck it on a usb, external hardrive or ipod, (doesn't work with the touch) plug it into your 360, PS3 or DVD Player with a USB imput. Go play from external device. If the quality isn't good enough, go desplay settings and change the screen size so it's smaller and better quality*\n\nThank                     a      n n      n n  p p p p     s s s s s s s s s s                        aaa     n  n     n n p   pp   p  s s s s s s s s s\n                        aaaaa    n n n    n n p  p  p   p  s s \n                       a a a a   n nn n   n n p  p  p   p   s s\n                     a a    a a  n n n n  n n p   pp   p     s s\n                    a a      a a n n  n n n n p p p p p       s s\n                    a aaaaaaaa a n n   n nn n p p            s s\n                    a a      a a n n    n n n p p           s s\n                    a a      a a n n     n  n p p         s s \n                    a a      a a n n     n  n p p s s s s  s \n                             s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s \n                              --------------------------  \n                                 P R O D U C T I O N\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c028775b190b09ebd3e545d32ab82cf663763e0","amp;dn":"Family.Guy.The.Starwars.Episode+-+%5BMp4.DVDRip%5D+%5BREQUESTED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c028775b190b09ebd3e545d32ab82cf663763e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,2,135,117,177,144,176,158,189,62,84,93,50,171,130,207,102,55,99,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
