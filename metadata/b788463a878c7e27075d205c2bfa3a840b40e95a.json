Since its inception by the late director Henri-Georges Clouzot the film was plagued with bad luck. He began filming it in 1964. There are only two characters in the film and on the third day of shooting the female lead became gravely ill. Later during rehearsals with a new actress, the director had a heart attack. Though he lived until 1977, he never got around to finishing it. The script was passed on to producer Marin Karmitz by Clouzot's widow. Paul wanted to buy the beautiful resort hotel he worked at for 15 years. His happy and spirited wife Nelly goes along with it. She is already a mother and contented with her life. Paul, who incurred tremendous debts to get the hotel, is not so happy. He is stressed to the breaking point. After he suspects his wife of philandering he slowly goes insane. He also begins increasing his consumption of alcohol and sleeping pills. Their lives become a living hell.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: L'Enfer.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,425,885,184 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:38:00\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 648x384 (AR: 1.688)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1738 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.279 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109731/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109731/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip\n\nClaude Chabrol - L'enfer (1994)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b788463a878c7e27075d205c2bfa3a840b40e95a","amp;dn":"Claude+Chabrol+-+L%5C%27enfer+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b788463a878c7e27075d205c2bfa3a840b40e95a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,136,70,58,135,140,126,39,7,93,32,92,43,250,58,132,11,64,233,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
