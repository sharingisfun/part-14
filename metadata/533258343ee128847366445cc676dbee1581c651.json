Twenty voices.\n\nEndless possibilities.\n\nThere's the girl who is in love with Holden Caulfield. The boy who wants to be strong who falls for the girl who's convinced she needs to be weak. The girl who writes love songs for a girl she can't have. The two boys teetering on the brink of their first anniversary. And everyone in between.\n\nAs he did in the highly acclaimed Boy Meets Boy, David Levithan gives us a world of unforgettable voices that readers will want to visit again and again. It's the realm of possibility open to us all - where love, joy, and the stories we tell will linger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:533258343ee128847366445cc676dbee1581c651","amp;dn":"The+Realm+of+Possibility+-+David+Levithan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"533258343ee128847366445cc676dbee1581c651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,50,88,52,62,225,40,132,115,102,68,92,198,118,219,238,21,129,198,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
