A team of saboteursÃ¢â‚¬â€including an expert on germ warfare, a Harvard professor, and a brilliant, debonair spymasterÃ¢â‚¬â€devise a series of Ã¢â‚¬Å“mysterious accidentsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ using explosives and biological weapons, to bring down vital targets such as ships, factories, livestock, and even captains of industry like J. P. Morgan.\n\nNew York Police Inspector Tom Tunney, head of the departmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bomb Squad, is assigned the difficult mission of stopping them. Assembling a team of loyal operatives, the cunning Irish cop hunts for the conspirators among a population of more than eight million Germans. But the deeper he finds himself in this labyrinth of deception, the more Tunney realizes that the enemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan is far more complex and more dangerous than he suspected.\n\nFull of drama and intensity, illustrated with eight pages of black and-white photos, Dark Invasion is riveting war thriller that chillingly echoes our own time.\n\nPublishers Weekly\n11/18/2013\nVanity Fair contributing editor Blum tells the story of a sabotage campaign that began in 1914 when the German ambassador to the U.S., Johann von Bernstoff, was instructed to develop an intelligence network to keep America out of WWI and prevent the shipment of supplies and war material to the AlliesÃ¢â‚¬â€both by Ã¢â‚¬Å“any means necessary.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The organization, focused in New York, opened Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Manhattan FrontÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1915 with a series of merchant-ship bombings. BlumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s central figure, police inspector Tom Tunney, an experienced undercover operative, was assigned to break what British intelligence had demonstrated to its U.S. counterparts was a terrorist operation. The Brits had depended on intercepted communications; Tunney and his Bomb Squad depended on police work. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There was no specific law against espionageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1915, but as his well-financed opponents escalated their efforts to the point of attempted murderÃ¢â‚¬â€of no less a figure than J.P. MorganÃ¢â‚¬â€and to projects for germ warfare, including anthrax, Tunney formed a picture, found Ã¢â‚¬Å“an angle of attack,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ closed in, and made arrests. BlumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first exercise in homeland security is a worthwhile page-turner, combining the best features of a police procedural and a spy novel with a firm base in verifiable events.\n\nKirkus Reviews\n\n013-11-24\nTerrifically engaging and pertinent tale of the New York City bomb squad that foiled German terrorist plots against the United States at the outbreak of World War I. Vanity Fair contributor Blum (The Floor of Heaven: A True Tale of the Last Frontier and the Yukon Gold Rush, 2011, etc.) masterly retrieves this largely forgotten, haunting history of Germany's subversive attempts to halt the U.S. ability to send munitions to the Allies fighting against it in Europe. The author pursues the key players in an episodic narrative: the agents of the Kaiser's secret intelligence service, the Abteilung IIIB, with commander Walter Nicolai extending its tentacles across the Atlantic to fund a campaign of shipping terror amid the New York and New Jersey docks; the members of the New York Police Bomb and Neutrality Squad, led by the enterprising Capt. Tom Tunney, who had lately infiltrated the anarchist Brescia Circle and diverted its attempt to bomb St. Patrick's Cathedral; and the strange and troubled Ivy League literature professor Erich Muenter, who went underground after poisoning his wife in 1906 and emerged as terrorist Frank Holt in 1915. The audacity of the German operatives, who received easy support from the plethora of German immigrants to America--e.g., the Hamburg-America Line officer Paul Koenig, who policed the shipyards in his thuggish way (&quot;a thick-bodied, bull-necked man with long, drooping arms and iron fists that could seem as hell-bent as a runaway trolley car when they were pounding away at your skull&quot;) was matched by the ingenuity of Tunney, who had a nose for the right clue and method of infiltration. Blum creates some memorable portraits, accompanied by a lively gallery of photos, and keeps the heroic good-versus-evil plot simmering along in a nicely calibrated work of popular narrative history. Instructive, yes, but also as engrossing as good detective fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3678b538799aaf09925cb590e72d49413add801","amp;dn":"Howard+Blum+-+Dark+Invasion+1915+-+America%27s+1st+Terrorist+Cell+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3678b538799aaf09925cb590e72d49413add801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,103,139,83,135,153,170,240,153,37,203,89,14,114,212,148,19,173,216,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
