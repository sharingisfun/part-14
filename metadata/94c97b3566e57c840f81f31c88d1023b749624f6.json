But for one summer, they agreed to give up all their 21st-century technology and travel back in time to discover the radical transformation of our leisure time since 1950.\r\nThe family's own home becomes their time machine as they are transported back to a different decade each week. Guided by presenters Giles Coren and social historian Polly Russell, the family's entire experience is underpinned by the Family Expenditure Survey, a government study which ran from the 50s right through to 1999. The survey's detailed spending records give us the best possible clue as to what families were doing with their leisure time across the five decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  80s \r\nThe Ashby-Hawkins family embrace the 1980s, where TV and shopping dominated the UK's leisure time. It's also the decade where technology arrives in homes in a significant way. Kids Daisy and Seth are thrilled by the new VCR and home computer, and there's even a pager for mum Steph who's now a shoulder padded businesswoman. When dad Rob is not trying out the kids' CB radio, he's going shopping for a Don Johnson makeover with fashion guru Caryn Franklin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1c/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2b/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/94/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen16.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2994 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06zyt4z","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c97b3566e57c840f81f31c88d1023b749624f6","amp;dn":"Back+In+Time+For+The+Weekend+Series+1+4of6+The+80s+720p+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c97b3566e57c840f81f31c88d1023b749624f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,201,123,53,102,229,124,132,15,129,243,28,136,209,2,59,116,150,36,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
