Equivalent to the original European game mode, the player starts\nin 1850 and experiences more than 150 years of railroad history. More\nthan 50 realistic American vehicles including trains, buses, streetcars\nand trucks are included.\n\nTo make the American experience complete, landscape and towns are\nmodified as well. Wild West stylized American towns spread in a desert\nlandscape and wait for a transport tycoon to be connected to the world.\nAlso, environment elements like trees, streets and the sky have been\nadapted.\n\nAll vehicles are realistic. Models and textures have been developed by\nusing blueprints and photographs of the original vehicles. As a result,\nthe USA DLC depicts quite a piece of American railroad and\ntransportation history.\n\nThe USA DLC has been developed in close collaboration with the modding\ncommunity. We are excited that modders have contributed more than 15\nvehicles. It s great to see such an active modding community. To\nfurther support these activities, together with the release of the USA\nDLC modding support is significantly extended.\n\nFeatures:\n\nComplete USA game mode (equivalent to European game mode)\n\nMore than 50 realistic and detailed American vehicles\n\nTrains, buses, streetcars and trucks of more than 150 years of American\nhistory\n\nAmerican landscape, towns, streets and environment\n\nNOTE: This expansion is made standalone\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1.
