It describes the six months of negotiations focusing on the &quot;Big Three&quot;, photographed together on its cover (left to right): Prime Minister David Lloyd George of the United Kingdom, Premier Georges Clemenceau of France, and President Woodrow Wilson of the United States. It is a dramatic and intimate view of those fateful days, which saw new political entities Ã¢â‚¬â€ Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Palestine, among them Ã¢â‚¬â€ born out of the ruins of bankrupt empires, and the borders of the modern world redrawn.\n\nThe book argues that the conditions imposed on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles did not lead to the rise of Adolf Hitler. \n\nIt was written by the Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan with a foreword by American diplomat Richard Holbrooke. It has won a number of awards that you have probably never heard of","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8325b76f7b1e4bc0f605072a9ed71984160c990","amp;dn":"Paris+1919%3A+%28History%29+-+Margaret+MacMillan+AZW3+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8325b76f7b1e4bc0f605072a9ed71984160c990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,50,91,118,247,177,228,188,15,96,80,114,169,237,113,152,65,96,201,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
