R.E.M. became a superstar band; HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼ never was more than a cult favorite. Nevertheless, their albums between 1981 and 1987 have proven remarkably influential; they provided the sonic blueprint for the roaring punk-pop hybrid that crossed over into the mainstream in the early '90s. Not only did they shape the sound of the music, they shaped the way independent bands made the transition to the major labels; they showed other bands that it was possible to record uncompromising music on a major label without losing any integrity or creative control. From the Replacements to Nirvana, the Pixies to Superchunk, nearly every major and minor band that appeared in the alternative underground in the late '80s and '90s owed a major debt to HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼, whether they were aware of it or not.\n\nThe band's two songwriters, guitarist Bob Mould and drummer Grant Hart, both had a knack for writing songs that essentially followed conventional pop structures, complete with memorable melodies, but were still punk songs. HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼ took the Buzzcocks' pioneering punk-pop and made it harder, both musically and lyrically. Throughout their career, HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼ never lost their edge, never turned down their amplifiers, never compromised their music. While Hart and bassist Greg Norton were an unfailingly strong rhythm section, Mould would prove to be one of the most influential guitarists of the decade. With his slashing rhythms, distorted strumming, and blazing leads, he set the stage for the alternative guitar heroes of the late '80s and the '90s.\n\n\n1. Land Speed Record (1982)\n2.
