Forming in 1987 in Leeds, England, the band was signed to 4AD Records records after their first London show by 4AD chief Ivo. Their first EP, Barging Into the Presence of God, was critically praised, but received minimal press, especially in the United States.\n\nAlbums\n\n1. Flesh Ballon, 1991 (EP)\n2.
