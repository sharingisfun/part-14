For example:\n\nWhy do Male Fairywrens bring flowers to females as a nuptial gift in the pre-dawn darkness? Especially when the gift-givers are not the official mates of the females concerned, but visitors, and furthermore they may give these gifts in full view of the official mate.\n\nWhy do gangs of White-winged Choughs 'kidnap' their neighbours' fledglings and them keep them in their 'gang'.\nWhich bird is so big, strong and fierce that stories abound of it killing humans? This book looks at accounts of murderous Cassowaries and explains just what might have happened.\nWhat happens in an albatross 'divorce'?\n\nThis book divides the world by continent and takes a series of extraordinary stories from each to illustrate a great diversity of bird behaviour. Each continent will have around five or six stories, each described in 1500 to 2000 words and examining the truths and the mythology behind each example. An intriguiguing book from an author with an author with an ability to engage with his audience.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Birds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4132a80eb5054ff625d7192cb30d2ef35f75780c","amp;dn":"Tales+of+Remarkable+Birds+by+Dominic+Couzens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4132a80eb5054ff625d7192cb30d2ef35f75780c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,50,168,14,181,5,79,246,37,215,25,44,179,13,46,243,95,117,120,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
