Most of the characters are human but as the series progresses other races are introduced, such as the cold and menacing Others from the far North and fire-breathing dragons from the East, both races thought to be extinct by the people of the story. There are three principal storylines in the series: the chronicling of a dynastic civil war for control of Westeros between several competing families; the rising threat of the Others who dwell beyond an immense wall of ice that forms Westeros' northern border; and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the exiled daughter of a king who was murdered in another civil war fifteen years previously, to return to Westeros and claim her rightful throne. As the series progresses, all three storylines become increasingly interwoven and dependent on each other.\n\nThe series is told in the limited third-person through the eyes of a number of point of view characters. By the end of the fourth volume, there have been seventeen such characters with multiple chapters and eight who only have one chapter apiece.\n\nThis Torrent includes, \n\n01 The Hedge Knight\n02 The Sworn Sword\n03 Song of Ice and Fire 1 - A Game of Thrones\n04 Song of Ice and Fire 2 - A Clash of Kings\n05 Song of Ice and Fire 3 - Storm of Swords\n06 Song of Ice and Fire 4 - A Feast For Crows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:240cdcd23e1d4a6bc9f6dd3dd20ffcf8518eb01f","amp;dn":"A+Song+of+Ice+and+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"240cdcd23e1d4a6bc9f6dd3dd20ffcf8518eb01f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,12,220,210,62,29,74,107,201,246,221,61,210,15,252,248,81,142,176,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
