For four days in Monte Carlo they're free to live someone else's life. As the weekend brings pulsating discos, high-stakes casinos, and more, Abbie is transported, finding the greatest pleasure and release she has ever known.\r\nWhat happened last night?In the morning's harsh light, Abbie awakens on a yacht, surrounded by police. Abbie, Winnie, Serena, and Bryah are arrested and accused of the foulest crime imaginable. And now the vacation of a lifetime becomes the fight of a lifetimeÂ—for survival.
