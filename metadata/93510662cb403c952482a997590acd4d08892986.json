The rhythms are tight and fluent, all those stop and go parts are played wich the precision of an atomic clock and the vibes and piano solos are as exciting as you could wish.\n\nTjader started playing latin music in George Shearing's quintet were he also met Santamaria and Bobo.  And although his music is more forceful than Shearing's take on latin jazz, he retained a feeling of intimacy, just like Shearing, playing some kind of 'latin chamber jazz'.\n\nThis incarnation of the Tjader sextet would stay together for about two years, recording a few more albums for Fantasy before Tjader switched to Verve (were he would employ Armando Peraza on percussion).  Probably none of this group's other albums for Fantasy - 'A Night At The Blackhawk', 'Tjader Goes Latin', 'Concert By The Sea', 'Concert On The Campus', 'Concerts In The Sun', 'Demasiado Caliente' - has the class of 'Latin Concert', which by the way was not actually recorded in concert.\n\nPersonnel\nCal Tjader (vib)\nVince Guaraldi (p)\nAl McKibbon (b)\nAl Torres (d)\nMongo Santamaria (cga)\nWillie Bobo (tim, d)\n\nSide A:\n01  Viva Cepeda (Tjader) 3:40\n02  Mood For Milt (Tjader) 3:10\n03  The Continental 3:50\n04  Lucero (Tjader) 4:26\n05  Tu Crees Que?
