Echoing, at various points, both bands at their most rocking, Baroque, and searching, One-Armed Bandit dazzles early on. Throughout the 13 minutes that make up the title track and the following Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bananfleur Overalt,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the listener is pulled through a suspenseful succession of passages, like a score to a Mediterranean tropical cyclone, that work in tight-riffing bass clarinet, zipping vibraphone, buzzing guitar, sighing pedal steel, dancing harpsichord, and even some distant skronk-sax over galloping and tapping rhythms that switch time signatures with an oddly elegant twitchiness. Later portions of the album are larded with so many graceless, attention-deficit hazards that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unknown exactly what the band (or is that Ã¢â‚¬Å“groopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?) was attempting to accomplish Ã¢â‚¬â€ perhaps a challenge or, more specifically, instrumental paeans to Frank Zappa and Mars Volta with horn charts. \n\n\n\n1     The Thing IntroducesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \t        0:23\n2     One-armed Bandit \t        \t7:07\n3     Bananfluer Overalt \t        6:16\n4     220 V / Spektral \t                7:03\n5     Toccata \t                \t9:10\n6     Prognissekongen \t        \t4:33\n7     Book of Glass \t                6:49\n8     Music!
