Guitarist Scott Henderson, bassist Victor Wooten, and drummer Steve Smith are three of the most inventive jazz-rock players who have pushed the style into uncharted waters during the late &amp;#039;80s and throughout the &amp;#039;90s. The clever name Vital Tech Tones infers each members primary bands: Smith&amp;#039;s Vital Information, Henderson&amp;#039;s Tribal Tech, and Wooten&amp;#039;s Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. The combined talent level of the band is astounding and the music created here is a reflection of not only their technical abilities, but also their compositional talents. The program maintains a jazz-rock fusion feel, but there is enough variety in the compositions that raise this above just another blowing session. That being stated, the cover of &quot;Giant Steps&quot; has to be heard to be believed, as does the Jimi Hendrix-influenced &quot;Lie Detector.&quot; A very rewarding session that proves that jazz-rock fusion can still be played with conviction, honesty, and integrity.\n\n\nTo check out all TQMP uploads:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&lt;/a&gt;\nOr use the TQMP searchtag.\n\nPlease feel free to join TQMP!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980&amp;#039;s cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format (flac is preferable) AND include artwork.
