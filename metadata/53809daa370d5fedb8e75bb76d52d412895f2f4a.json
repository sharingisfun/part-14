Speaking of gross (kidding), they also talk about Keith the Cop's ass, the stunts that Dave is willing to do &quot;for the show&quot;, Alex Jones, and a few different podcasts that are actually worth listening to these days. We learn about a chance meeting Dave and Ant had in the past, their thoughts on how &quot;accountability&quot; changes due to your profession, how satire is missed by many, and then hilariously discuss how red-headed people are treated. They wrap up with a conversation about Seinfeld, Mike Francesa, the TV series Fargo and True Detective, and end the show with a listener call that leads to more reminiscing about the SiriusXM days and a &quot;PSA&quot; on where you can (and should) listen to Dave more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53809daa370d5fedb8e75bb76d52d412895f2f4a","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53809daa370d5fedb8e75bb76d52d412895f2f4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,128,157,170,55,13,95,237,184,231,91,183,109,82,212,18,137,95,47,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
