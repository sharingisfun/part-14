He inspired many famous practitioners of the fingerstyle acoustic guitar such as Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, Martin Carthy, John Martyn, Paul Simon and Jimmy Page, who based his solo &quot;White Summer&quot; on Graham's &quot;She moved thru' the Bizarre/Blue Raga&quot; and &quot;Mustapha&quot;. Graham is probably best-known for his acoustic instrumental, &quot;Anji&quot; and for his pioneering use of DADGAD tuning, later widely adopted by acoustic guitarists.[2]\n\nIt was not in Graham's nature to pursue fame and fortune and he retired to relative obscurity for many years, when he engaged in charity work and teaching as well as protracted periods of drug use, before beginning to tour again in the years before his death. His childlike, almost obsessive, enthusiasm for music never left him, however, and he would gladly give a free private concert to any chance acquaintance.\n\nThe Guitar Player is an album by British guitarist Davey Graham (then Davy Graham), released in 1963. It was his first LP after releasing the EP 3/4 A.D. two years earlier.[1]\n\nIn his Allmusic review, critic Thom Jurek stated, &quot;The Guitar Player is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, instrumental acoustic guitar record of the 1960s and 1970s British folk scene.&quot;\n\nIt was reissued in 2003 on CD by Sanctuary Records with eight bonus tracks. It was also released as The Guitar Player...
