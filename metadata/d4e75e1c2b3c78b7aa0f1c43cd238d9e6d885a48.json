Harvey resents Wolfit's class consciousness and vows to rise to the top by wooing the millionaire's daughter, Heather Sears. Meanwhile he has an affair with Frenchwoman Simone Signoret. Though he regards Signoret as a mere self-gratifying conquest, she takes their romance seriously enough to kill herself when Harvey impregnates Field. Only as he leaves the chapel after marrying the millionaire's daughter does Harvey that his &quot;smart&quot; marriage, coupled with the guarantee of a fabulous business career, has been attained at the cost of his soul. Based on the novel by John Braine, Room at the Top was one of the most successful films of the British angry-young-man school; it later spawned two sequels, as well as a weekly TV series.\n\nAwards:\nWon 2 Oscars. Another 8 wins &amp; 10 nominations\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4e75e1c2b3c78b7aa0f1c43cd238d9e6d885a48","amp;dn":"Room+at+the+Top+%281959%29+Jack+Clayton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4e75e1c2b3c78b7aa0f1c43cd238d9e6d885a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,231,94,28,43,60,120,183,170,15,28,67,205,35,141,158,109,136,90,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
