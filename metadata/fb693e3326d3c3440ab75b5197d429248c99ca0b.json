He is generally considered a writer of fabulation and metafiction.\n\nCoover's best-known work, The Public Burning, deals with the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in terms that have been called magic realism. Half of the book is devoted to the mythic hero Uncle Sam of tall tales, dealing with the equally fantastic Phantom, who represents international Communism. The alternate chapters portray the efforts of Richard Nixon to find what is really going on amidst the welter of narratives. A later novella, Whatever Happened to Gloomy Gus of the Chicago Bears offers an alternate Nixon, one who is devoted to football and sex with the same doggedness with which he pursued political success in this reality. The theme anthology A Night at the Movies includes the story &quot;You Must Remember This&quot;, a piece about Casablanca that features an explicit description of what Rick and Ilsa did when the camera wasn't on them. Pinocchio in Venice returns to mythical themes.\nCoover is one of the founders of the Electronic Literature Organization. In 1987 he was chosen as the winner of the Rea Award for the Short Story.\n\n\nThe torrent contains following books in epUB format:\n\n*  Novels\n\nGerald's Party (1986)\n\nNoir (2010)\n\nPinocchio in Venice (1991)\n\nThe Brunist Day of Wrath (2014)\n\n\n\n*  Short stories &amp; Plays Collections  \n\nPricksongs &amp; Descants (1969) (collection)\n\nA Night at the Movies or, You Must Remember This (1987) (themed anthology)\n\n\nRead the following article, interviews,and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Coover&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Coover&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jun/27/robert-coover-life-in-writing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jun/27/robert-coover-life-in-writing&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bookslut.com/features/2010_03_015786.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bookslut.com/features/2010_03_015786.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb693e3326d3c3440ab75b5197d429248c99ca0b","amp;dn":"Robert+Coover+-+Gerald%27s+Party+%26amp%3B+Other+Works+%286+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb693e3326d3c3440ab75b5197d429248c99ca0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,105,62,51,38,211,195,68,10,183,91,81,151,212,41,36,140,153,202,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
