It was recorded live  using just two microphones into a Revox A77 reel to reel recorder. The music and ambience are excellent. \r\n\r\nCeremony of Angels is on the Golden String Audiophile label from Japan and features works by Back, Beethove, Mozart, Britten etc, and features solo harp and the Toyko Girls Choir. Sonics again are excellent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49c1e67e3b6966e4aee1e2875048fde067083a89","amp;dn":"Audiophile+Seasonal+Music-Cantante+Domino%2C+Ceremony+of+Angels+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49c1e67e3b6966e4aee1e2875048fde067083a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,193,230,126,59,105,102,228,174,225,226,135,80,72,253,224,103,8,58,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
