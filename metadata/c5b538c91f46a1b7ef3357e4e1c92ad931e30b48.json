But this is a very unusual class as the children, aged three to five study... philosophy! Seated in a circle around a ritually lit candle, the children, in a fresh, funny and sometimes merciless manner, approach the universal subjects of love, power, difference, growing up, death etc. Little by little the philosophy workshop becomes a privileged moment where each child reflects on the words of the other, learns how to listen and to build a discourse. From now on they will be able to think for themselves! With their emotions, their unusual expressions and their contradictions, the children of this nursery school deliver a single testimony on an innovative experiment. &quot;Just A Beginning&quot; is the fabulous true story of a school with an eye on the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5b538c91f46a1b7ef3357e4e1c92ad931e30b48","amp;dn":"Just+A+Beginning+-+Ce+n%27est+qu%27un+d%26eacute%3Bbut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5b538c91f46a1b7ef3357e4e1c92ad931e30b48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,181,56,201,31,70,161,183,239,51,87,228,225,201,42,217,49,227,11,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
