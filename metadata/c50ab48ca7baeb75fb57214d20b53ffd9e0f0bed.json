It is Swedish director Lukas Moodysson&amp;#039;s third full length film which marks a sharp change of mood from his previous two films, the uplifting love story Show Me Love and the 1970s comedy Together. Lilya 4-Ever is an unremittingly brutal and realistic story of the downward spiral of Lilya (Oksana Akinshina), a girl in the former Soviet Union, whose mother abandons her to move to the United States. The story is based on the life of Danguole Rasalaite and examines the issue of trafficking in human beings and sexual slavery.\n\nUnavailable in the North American Region 1 DVD format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c50ab48ca7baeb75fb57214d20b53ffd9e0f0bed","amp;dn":"Lilya+4-ever+-+2002+-+Swedish+Film+-+English+Subtitles+-+Lilja+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c50ab48ca7baeb75fb57214d20b53ffd9e0f0bed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,10,180,140,167,186,235,117,251,87,33,77,32,181,63,253,158,15,11,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
