Today, Century Media is revealing all the details. Find out all about it below including the cover artwork. After months of work, the long-awaited box sets have finally been sent off to the pressing plants.\n\nThe box set contains the albums Bergtatt (1994), Kveldssanger (1995) and Nattens Madrigal (1996), collectively known as The Trilogie - Three Journeyes Through The Norwegian Netherworlde (released under this title as a 1000 limited edition triple picture vinyl box set in 1997). Bonus contents will be the band's demo tape Vargnatt (1993), the rare compilation track &quot;Synen&quot; (Cthulhu Records 1997) as well as a recently unearthed 4-track rehearsal recording featuring tracks from Nattens Madrigal.\n\nWith the exception of Nattens Madrigal, now with a slightly more compassionate re-mastering courtesy of Tom KvÃƒÂ¥lsvoll at Strype Audio, Oslo, all the material has been considerately re-mastered to analog tape by Jaime Gomes Arellano in Orgone Studios, London, and consulted by Ulver's mastermind Kristoffer Rygg.\n\nTrolsk Sortmetall 1993 - 1997 comes as a brazen 5CD box set with a canvas-bound slipcase and 100+ page booklet as well as a 4LP box (plus rehearsal tape). The layout has been done by Metastazis, who has previously worked with Ulver and has for this project been given access to lots of never before seen archival material.\n\nHardcover book with 104 pages of unpublished photos and paraphernalia, original Norwegian lyrics, presentations and their English translations, comments by the band as well as liner notes by Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen (founder of Head Not Found Records and the man behind Slayer Mag), Chris Bruni (Profound Lore Records), Michael Moynihan (author of Lords Of Chaos) and Mark Pilkington (Strange Attractor Press).\n\nThe 5CD box will be limited to 3000 copies worldwide.Somehow I dont think its gonna work out like that.\nCode\nContents Of This Upload:\n\n   CD 1: Vargnatt\n\n   CD 2: Bergtatt - Et Eeventyr i 5 Capitler\n\n   CD 3: Kveldssanger\n\n   CD 4: Nattens Madrigal - Aatte Hymne til Ulven i Manden\n\n   CD 5: Nattens Madrigal - 4 track rehearsal, summer 1995\n\nCDrips CBR320 (LAME 3.99), properly tagged (iTunes ready) + 700x700 album cover attached to mp3 files.\nGenre:\tBlack\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t393.96 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n37 files\nAdded:\t22/11/2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:671f10f5cd5402fe06f7111e5c94751cde1778c4","amp;dn":"Ulver+-+Trolsk+Sortmetall+1993-1997+%282014%29+5CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"671f10f5cd5402fe06f7111e5c94751cde1778c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,31,16,245,205,84,2,254,6,247,17,30,92,148,117,28,222,23,120,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
