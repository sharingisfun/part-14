This text discusses solving reaction engineering problems through logic rather than memorization and the use of algorithms. It is unique in that it provides many worked examples with real chemistry that use today's technology and software to solve them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba9413157f5247d2ee4ac10df31dfc07fcc4a06","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2004%5D+Elements+of+Chemical+Reaction+Engineering+%283rd+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba9413157f5247d2ee4ac10df31dfc07fcc4a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,169,65,49,87,245,36,125,46,228,172,16,223,49,223,192,127,204,74,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
