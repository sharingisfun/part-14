His 2007 album ROCK N ROLL JESUS completes that transition. A big album that bowls straight up the middle, ROCK N ROLL JESUS is Kid's homage to the grits and gravy of classic rock, a 21st-century update of FM radio fare from the 1970s.\n\nGone for most part is his hip-hop posturing and in-your-face putdowns; in their place are invocations of Skynyrd, Bob Seger, Steve Miller, and the like. &quot;All Summer Long,&quot; a bouncy, sunny tune that bears a striking resemblance to &quot;Sweet Home Alabama,&quot; is a case in point; while &quot;Roll On&quot; has the smooth-rolling feel of the Eagles' early work. Rock cuts loose, to be sure, as on the head-banging &quot;So Hott,&quot; but even these tracks are injected with a retro feel, summoning classic AC/DC more than anything from the '00's. Longtime Rock fans might miss the bad attitude, but fans of classic '70s rock should feel right at home.\n\nRock &amp; Roll Jesus CD \n\nRecording information: Blackbird Studios, Nashville, TN; East Iris Studios, Nashville, TN; The Allen Roadhouse.\n\nAuthor: Kid Rock.\n\nPhotographer: Clay Patrick McBride.\n\nUnknown Contributor Roles: Paul T.
