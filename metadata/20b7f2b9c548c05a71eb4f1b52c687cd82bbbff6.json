Located in the Himalayan Range, 25 miles west of Mount Everest, Cho OyuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s massive bulk straddles the border between Nepal and Tibet. Known as one of the easiest 8,000-meter peaks to climb, it is becoming more popular than Everest. But contrary to popular belief, in the rarified air above 26,906 feet, nothing comes easy.\n\nFollow this team of climbers as they reveal, through their own words, the physical and mental barriers confronted throughout their journey. From landslides destroying roads in Nepal, to a selfless rescue attempt ending in tragedy, this is a film about the true nature of Himalayan expeditions. In the end, only a small handful in this large expedition reaches the ultimate goal. Join us on an incredible journey through the timeless culture of Nepal and the breathtaking landscapes of the Tibetan Plateau. Witness the unpredictable nature of Himalayan climbing and the diminishing affect altitude can have on the human body as we climb without oxygen to 26,906 feet.
