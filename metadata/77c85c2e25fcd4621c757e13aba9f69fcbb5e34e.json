Then she suddenly retired to run her own boutique and raise her family. Now with her daughter Rosalind, Jojo is ready to show the fashion world she&amp;#039;s still got style. Does she still have the impeccable sense of mixing and matching that earned her the nickname, Mistress of Mix? Help Jojo storm back onto the runway as she stages fabulous fashion shows from New York to Paris to Milan. Make stylish outfits from cute tops, elegant dresses and stunning heels as you showcase your fashion sense on the runway. \n\nThe Design \n\nWe originally conceived this game as another spinning plates retail game, but this time with a dash of fashion. However, after developing an early prototype it became clear that the game wasnÃƒÂ¢??t fulfilling on the promise of high fashionÃƒÂ¢??running around a boutique, serving customers didnÃƒÂ¢??t feel glamorous enough. The game was fun, but didnÃƒÂ¢??t capture the more subjective decisions of style and making cool looking outfits. So we went back to the drawing board to see if we could devise a game system that allowed players choice in the clothes they picked out and arranged. The design challenge was, ÃƒÂ¢??How do we make paper-dolling into a fun goal-oriented game?ÃƒÂ¢?? For that we devised a system to describe clothing attributes and match them to styles. The end result is game where you get to make interesting and fun clothing choices as you assemble outfits. ItÃƒÂ¢??s a matching game along very different vectors. Instead of simply color matching outfits, youÃƒÂ¢??re looking for more natural characteristics like long sleeves to wear in the winter or miniskirts and platform boots to wear in Mod outfits. \n\nAssemble thousands of different stylish outfits as you unlock hundreds of unique clothing items and accessories \nExplore 35 different clothing styles ranging from Western to Bridal to Eveningwear \nPlay 60 action puzzle levels by matching styles and finding hot signature outfits from different clothing mixes \nCreate, save and export your favorite outfits in Dress-Up Mode \nSystem Requirements\n\nWindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2000/XP/Vista \nPentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 4 processor, 800 MHz \n256 MB RAM \n38 MB hard drive space \nMinimum Screen Resolution: 800x600 \nDirect3D enabled Graphics Card \nDirectX version 7.0 or later \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c85c2e25fcd4621c757e13aba9f69fcbb5e34e","amp;dn":"Jojo%5C%27s+Fashion+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c85c2e25fcd4621c757e13aba9f69fcbb5e34e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,200,92,46,37,252,212,98,28,117,126,19,171,169,246,159,203,181,227,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
