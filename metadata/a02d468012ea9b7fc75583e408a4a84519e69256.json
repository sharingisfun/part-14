The current lineup includes two original members in bassist Matt Verschoor and drummer Dick Vijgen along with two younger musicians in vocalist/ guitarist Leon Lohmann and guitarist Ivo Metz. Spurred on by the gigs and success of this full length, the quartet decided to write another set of songs and release a follow up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s see if Ã¢â‚¬Å“Warrior SoulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can hold up to the standard the band has pushed forth.\n\nStylistically EAR DANGER prefer playing close to the NWOBHM vest Ã¢â‚¬â€œ soaring vocals, easy on the ear/ shout a long choruses, guitars and bass leading the music charge while the drumming has this youthful energy to raise fists and chants. The title track opens the proceedings, a glorious rally cry for the cause, the lead break in line with speedier RAVEN Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while the follow up Ã¢â‚¬Å“Star IllusionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a boat load of JUDAS PRIEST elements in the opening two riffs that nick Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rapid FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“British SteelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album.\n\nLeon may not be the most pitch perfect singer, but a lot of times in this genre attitude can more than make up for deficiencies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and I believe his sharp metal intuition matches up well to the semi-gallops, classic 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s hooks, and general rocking material at hand. Check out Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Am Your EnemyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“CrusaderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for his charm, something that I could have easily pictured coming from 1981-1983. And the cover art is as Ã¢â‚¬ËœTraditional MetalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as you can get- a clear indication that their lifelong commitment will not waver.\n\nI can picture this band galvanizing the younger metal bands to keep the purity of the genre at heart when they create new material. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Warrior SoulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is another fantastic record, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so glad that EAR DANGER kept the faith Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as the long journey is paying off. 4 Star Rating\nTracklist:\n1.
