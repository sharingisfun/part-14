In his recovery, he returned to his childhood roots in the Lutheran church and embraced his Christianity that continues to inform his life and work today.\n\nIn the pages of this book, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find insightful comments from some of the biggest names in heavy metal, along with life lessons for every reader. Whether religious or not, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be enthralled, informed, and inspired by this tell-all book on discovering meaning in a life of rock and roll.\nGenre: Biography/Memoir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bece34dd6c349e5ad5d729b6fb45649f3c23b68","amp;dn":"My+Life+with+Deth+Discovering+Meaning+in+a+Life+of+Rock+%26amp%3B+Ro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bece34dd6c349e5ad5d729b6fb45649f3c23b68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,236,227,77,214,195,73,229,173,93,114,155,111,180,86,73,243,194,59,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
