This one gets off to a bluesy start with &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; and &quot;You Don't Love Me,&quot; plus a jazzy version of &quot;Who's Been Talking&quot; that lets Derek soar into the stratosphere. The lovely Susan Tedeschi joins the band for her only West Coast guest appearance, on Bob Dylan's &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's Alright.&quot;\n\nIf you love extended jams, the second half of this show is what you are looking for!  &quot;New Instrumental&quot; continues to grow into yet another classic ABB instrumental jam, with this tune drawing from Derek's jazz influences. &quot;Black Hearted Woman&quot; is an overwhelming show of force, proving that nobody can deliver raw rock power like the ABB can. &quot;Jessica&quot; is a beautiful conversation between all the band members, as the music ebbs and flows like a river finding its way to the ocean.\n\nPat Simmons of the Doobie Brothers, who opened for the Allmans at this show, sits in on a raucous &quot;Southbound&quot; encore that put an exclamation point on the evening!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e93b3be378a61f588d937da6757c9fdb955832b0","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+05%2F22%2F2009+%5B320k+MP3%5D+Valley+Center","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e93b3be378a61f588d937da6757c9fdb955832b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,59,59,227,120,166,31,88,141,147,125,166,117,124,159,219,149,88,50,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
