Donald Rimstidt\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/29972/cover/9781107029972.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/29972/cover/9781107029972.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nabout book :-\n\nThis well-organised, comprehensive reference and textbook describes rate models developed from fundamental kinetic theory and presents models using consistent terminology and notation. Major topics include rate equations, reactor theory, transition state theory, surface reactivity, advective and diffusive transport, aggregation kinetics, nucleation kinetics, and solid-solid transformation rates. The theoretical basis and mathematical derivation of each model is presented in detail and illustrated with worked examples from real-world applications to geochemical problems. The book is also supported by online resources: self-study problems put students' new learning into practice, and spreadsheets provide the full data used in figures and examples, enabling students to manipulate the data for themselves. This is an ideal overview for graduate students, providing a solid understanding of geochemical kinetics. It will also provide researchers and professional geochemists with a valuable reference for solving practical and scientific problems.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/29972/cover/9781107029972.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/29972/cover/9781107029972.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nJ. Donald Rimstidt is a Professor Emeritus of Geochemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). During his 30-year career there he has taught several graduate courses, including Aqueous Geochemistry, Environmental Geochemistry, Geochemical Kinetics, and Geochemical Thermodynamics. The effective pedagogic methods from those courses, for building quantitative skills and instructing modelling techniques, underlie this book. Professor Rimstidt is the author or co-author of more than 100 papers, including his seminal article 'Kinetics of Silica-Water Reactions' (with Hu Barnes, 1980) which forms the basis of the quasi-thermodynamic presentation of transition state theory presented in this book.\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:102d35b7bdd00233659b59cc48bbd4665db91c84","amp;dn":"Geochemical+Rate+Models%3A+An+Introduction+to+Geochemical+Kinetics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"102d35b7bdd00233659b59cc48bbd4665db91c84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,45,53,183,189,208,2,51,101,155,89,204,72,187,212,102,93,185,28,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
