But he was not always such a roaring success. &quot;The Life of Lee&quot; is an utterly hilarious and very moving autobiography charting his ups and downs on the way to the top. Lee takes us on a darkly humorous journey through his childhood spent running wild on a Bristol housing estate, his unconventional school days and through a grim teenage period of numerous dead-end jobs. The book also reveals how as a boy Lee got his first taste of showbiz, accompanying his entertainer father around the rowdy, unforgiving working-men's club and theatre circuit. Desperately struggling to be accepted, this quiet young loner always saw himself as an outsider. But he finally met the love of his life and accidentally discovered the one place where he felt at home: the stage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:388223211537964ca1757802b47f0f6446c8f43c","amp;dn":"The+Life+Of+Lee+By+Lee+Evans+%28Epub%2CMobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"388223211537964ca1757802b47f0f6446c8f43c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,130,35,33,21,55,150,76,161,117,120,2,180,127,15,100,70,200,244,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
