But Martin wanted to be a writer even if it meant turning his back on the family legacy. Then his wife goes missing, and Martin is forced to delve into the dark history Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and darker secrets Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of that same family. It's a path that will lead him back to the Bronx Kill: that lonely, godforsaken stretch of land where many years earlier his grandfather had been brutally murdered, and where finally he will learn the truth about his wife's disappearance. It's a truth more monstrous than he could ever have imagined. Entertainment Weekly &quot;It&quot; writer Peter Milligan (GREEK STREET, HUMAN TARGET) joins forces with New York cartoonist and fine artist James Romberger (Seven Miles a Second) for an urban mystery drenched in family secrets. Don't miss the newest sure-fire hit from Vertigo Crime!\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded] - Memoir (#1-6):\n\n\nthepiratebay.se/torrent/8800461\n\n\n** If you have any question please feel free to ask! **\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df9940215c263655e3dc3f96aa76b990251cfa5a","amp;dn":"The+Bronx+Kill+%28Vertigo%29+%5BGN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df9940215c263655e3dc3f96aa76b990251cfa5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,153,64,33,92,38,54,85,227,220,63,150,170,118,185,144,37,28,250,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
