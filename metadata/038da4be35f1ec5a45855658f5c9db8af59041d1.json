Assistant Navy Secretary Theodore Roosevelt decides to experience the war first hand by promoting and joining a volunteer cavalry regiment. The regiment, later known as the Rough Riders, brings together volunteers from all corners of the nation and all walks of life. When Roosevelt and his men finally land on Cuba, they face ambush, intense enemy fire, and a desperate, outnumbered charge up a defended hill.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:038da4be35f1ec5a45855658f5c9db8af59041d1","amp;dn":"Rough+Riders++%28Western+1997%29++Tom+Berenger%2C+Sam+Elliott+%26amp%3B+Ga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"038da4be35f1ec5a45855658f5c9db8af59041d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,141,164,190,53,241,236,90,69,133,86,88,245,201,219,138,245,144,65,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
