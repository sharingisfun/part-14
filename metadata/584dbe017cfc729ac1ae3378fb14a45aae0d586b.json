O Caroline\n \nThis is an excellent audience recording of a unique performance.\n\nThe Progman Cometh Festival was simultaneously the most wonderful and the most\nweird concert going experience that I have ever had. Wonderful because I am a big\nfan of Canterbury music and I never expected to see such a fantastic assembly of\nmusicians (Richard Sinclair, Phil Miller, Pip Pyle, Allan Holdworth, Hugh Hopper,\nElton Dean, John Marshall, Kevin Ayers, Daevid Allen, etc.) perform in various\nconfigurations over a weekend. Weird because there was no more than 75 people\nin attendance even though the hall could hold 1000. The festival was poorly\npromoted and I was lucky to hear about it through a friend. In any case,\nit was a tremendous weekend of music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:584dbe017cfc729ac1ae3378fb14a45aae0d586b","amp;dn":"Daevid+Allen+%26amp%3B+Kevin+Ayers-University+Of+Errors+%282002-08-18%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"584dbe017cfc729ac1ae3378fb14a45aae0d586b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,77,190,1,124,252,114,154,193,174,51,120,251,20,164,90,174,13,88,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
