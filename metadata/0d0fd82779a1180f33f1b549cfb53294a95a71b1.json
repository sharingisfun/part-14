The rarity value of these items, however, far outweighs any concerns about video or audio quality.\n\nWith many thanks to SpinyNorman, the original ripper, for all his efforts.\n\nEnjoy, and seed generously! :)\n\nVideo: 704x528, 25fps XVid\nAudio: 128 kbit/s, MP3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d0fd82779a1180f33f1b549cfb53294a95a71b1","amp;dn":"Monty+Python+-+Industrial+Films","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d0fd82779a1180f33f1b549cfb53294a95a71b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,15,216,39,121,161,24,15,51,241,181,73,207,181,50,148,169,90,113,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
