Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here's what I want. I want everybody to back off and let me play football. I want you to go back to practicing medicine because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m ready for you to be happy again - not this forced shit that you keep trying to sell me. I want Brad to get his house finished because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m tired of listening to his DIY project updates. I want Jenny to decide on a hair color. I want Aiden and Rachael to either figure their shit out or leave each other alone, because AidenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chick drama is annoying. I want Mark to quit trying so hard to be my buddy again. I want my parents to get off my back about us living in sin. I want you to pick a date to marry me. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I want. What am I going to get? None of it, because I have to do another interview to try to patch the gaping wound that is my life with a Band-Aid.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f3a4d77ea69db2026ad401928b2fc12c7bbbea","amp;dn":"Finding+Infinity-+Harper%2C+Layne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f3a4d77ea69db2026ad401928b2fc12c7bbbea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,243,164,215,126,166,157,178,2,106,212,1,146,139,47,193,44,123,187,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
