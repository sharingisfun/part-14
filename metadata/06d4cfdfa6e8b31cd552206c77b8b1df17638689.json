Joining Coltrane (tenor sax) are Lee Morgan (trumpet), Curtis Fuller (trombone), Kenny Drew (piano), Paul Chambers (bass), and Philly Joe Jones (drums). \n\nThe triple horn arrangements incorporate an additional sonic density that remains a trademark unique to both this band and album. Of particular note is Fuller's even-toned trombone, which bops throughout the title track as well as the frenetic &quot;Moments Notice.&quot; Other solos include Paul Chambers' subtly understated riffs on &quot;Blue Train&quot; as well as the high energy and impact from contributions by Lee Morgan and Kenny Drew during &quot;Locomotion.&quot; The track likewise features some brief but vital contributions from Philly Joe Jones -- whose efforts throughout the record stand among his personal best. Of the five sides that comprise the original Blue Train, the Jerome Kern/Johnny Mercer ballad &quot;I'm Old Fashioned&quot; is the only standard; in terms of unadulterated sentiment, this version is arguably untouchable. \n\nFuller's rich tones and Drew's tastefully executed solos cleanly wrap around Jones' steadily languid rhythms. Without reservation, Blue Train can easily be considered in and among the most important and influential entries not only of John Coltrane's career, but of the entire genre of jazz music as well.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Blue Train\n02 - Moment's Notice\n03 - Locomotion\n04 - I'm Old Fashioned\n05 - Lazy Bird\n06 - Blue Train (alt. take 1) (bonus track)\n07 - Blue Train (alt. take 2) (bonus track)\n08 - Lazy Bird (alt. take) (bonus track)\n\n*2014 Universal Japan / Blue Note / Capitol | BN 75th The Masterworks | TYCJ-81001\n                {2014 Japan SHM-CD Blue Note 24-bit Remaster}\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Coltrane - tenor sax\nLee Morgan - trumpet\nCurtis Fuller - trombone\nKenny Drew - piano\nPaul Chambers - bass\n&quot;Philly&quot; Joe Jones - drums\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, Seed and Sharing.
