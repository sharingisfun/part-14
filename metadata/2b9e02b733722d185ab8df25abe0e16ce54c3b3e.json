Gain the confidence to begin to learn and speak Filipino (Tagalog). Master basic conversational skills, including greetings and introductions, simple questions and answers, shopping and much more. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFilipino (Tagalog) Learning Tips\nTagalog Learning Tips (Filipino)\nIn Filipino, most letters of the alphabet have only one corresponding sound, making learning to read easy. Vowel sounds are not combined in Filipino words. When two vowels appear together, each is pronounced as a separate syllable. For example, babae (woman) is pronounced as ba-ba-e. \nFilipino uses affixes, which are letters that attach to root words. Affixes determine the wordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meaning. For example: will eat kakain \nis eating kumakain \nate kumain \n\nLearning prepositions is easy in Filipino since the language has only two prepositions, nasa and sa. \nContractions are commonly used in Filipino. For example: pula na libro (red book) becomes pulang libro \nbata na lalaki (young male) becomes batang lalaki \n\nFilipino speakers employ polite speech when conversing with strangers or elders. Use of the word po or plural pronouns in speech are common ways to show respect. \nWhen asking a question that can be answered with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“yesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“no,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ speakers use the question marker ba. Rosetta Stone will teach you how to use this important word in asking questions. \nIn addition to learning the Filipino words for numbers, you will learn the Spanish words for the numbers one through twelve, which are used in telling time. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis level will help you:\nBuild vocabulary and language basics Spell and write accurately \nSpeak without a script \nRetain what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned \nRead and understand in your new language \nSample topics include: \nAge, family relations, household items Introductions and greetings \nTimes of day and calendar terms \nBuying and selling \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRequirements for Rosetta Stone User Workstations\nWindows (32-bit editions only) 2000, XP or Vista, Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5 512 MB RAM \n1 GHz or faster processor speed \n600 MB free hard-drive space (per level) \n16-bit sound card \n800 x 600 display resolution (1024 x 768 recommended) \nInternet or phone connection required for product activation \nSpeech recognition feature requires a headset microphone (included with purchase) \n16X CD-ROM Drive (for installation) \nNote for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ users: \nCurrent Rosetta Stone products have been engineered to install and run on the Windows Vista operating system.
