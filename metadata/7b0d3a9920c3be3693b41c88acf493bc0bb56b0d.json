I checked out several of his other artbooks but didn't find any of them nearly as interesting as this one. The &quot;people&quot; in this book genuine look as if they are experiencing emotion to me. Sadness, frustration, confusion, anger. It's not a very long book, but I liked it enough to pass it along to those who have been checking out the various artbooks I've uploaded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b0d3a9920c3be3693b41c88acf493bc0bb56b0d","amp;dn":"Abe+Yoshitoshi+-+Not+Found","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b0d3a9920c3be3693b41c88acf493bc0bb56b0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,13,58,153,32,195,190,54,147,180,28,136,172,244,147,188,11,181,107,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
