But that natural talent isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t foolproof; 50 years of padded running shoes and poor posture mean about 80% of runners suffer from injury every year.\n\nChapter 2\nThe Human Foot Is An Evolutionary Masterpiece\nWith its complex system of springs, levers and nerve endings, the foot is one of the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major sensory organs. Humans are naturally good at walking, running and sprinting. Jogging, or, slow, sticky heel-striking in padded shoes is not a natural\nmovement and is responsible for countless runnersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ injuries.\n\nChapter 3\nProprioception: Our Sixth Sense\nProprioception is the sense of our bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position and orientation. We use this sense to move and the more feedback, the better the movement. About 70% of that feedback comes via pressure receptors, mostly located in the feet. The human foot needs protection, but thick, shock-absorbing soles greatly reduce sensory feedback and therefore limit the quality of movement.\n\nChapter 4\nFootwear That Makes Sense\nTo run barefoot is your default setting, but to do this in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world, you need a shoe that gives a balanced, unrestricted and protected experience, while also allowing maximum sensory feedback between your feet and your brain - from sole to soul.\n\nChapter 5\nReawaken Your Innate Barefoot Running Skill\nYou have the hardware, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve forgotten the software. Re-building your barefoot running technique will take time, particularly if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been wearing padded footwear all your life. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an exciting, joyful and probably  life-changing journey. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to help take you through it, step-by-step. Literally.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4993d95d65434e5358aeb63c72a88a9b1b1a7af4","amp;dn":"Proprioception+-+Making+Sense+of+Barefoot+Running.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4993d95d65434e5358aeb63c72a88a9b1b1a7af4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,147,217,93,101,67,78,83,88,174,182,60,114,168,138,155,27,26,122,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
