The extension registry is maintained by SGI and contains specifications for all known extensions, written as modifications to the appropriate specification documents. The registry also defines naming conventions, guidelines for creating new extensions and writing suitable extension specifications, and other related documentation. OpenGL Extension Viewer is a reliable software which displays the vendor name, the version implemented, the renderer name and the extensions of the current OpenGL 3D accelerator. The OpenGL diagnostic tool performs some OpenGL initialisation and graphical test. It will use the desktop resolution. So in case of slow downs or initialisation errors, use a smaller desktop resolution. \n\nMore Info: \n\nOpen GL is developed by realtech-vr.com. It is compatible with Windows 2K/2003/XP &amp; Vista.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8ad7a494301faaf0115355d78e57039d91b202f","amp;dn":"%28Software%29+OpenGL+Extension+Viewer+3.1.0+-+DLLOZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8ad7a494301faaf0115355d78e57039d91b202f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,173,122,73,67,1,250,175,1,21,53,93,120,229,112,57,217,27,32,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
