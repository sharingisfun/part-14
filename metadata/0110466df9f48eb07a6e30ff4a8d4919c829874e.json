Across the three garments, they will be looking for avant-garde cutting-edge designs and the trickiest pattern cutting ever seen on the Sewing Bee.\n\nThe formidable first challenge sees the sewers taking on a pattern as complex as origami - with no diagrams to help them. The brain-teasing instructions almost prove too much for one of the finalists.\n\nThe next challenge sees alterations so extraordinary they leave Patrick speechless, and finally they are asked to fit an avant-garde dress for a model they weren't expecting, before Claudia Winkleman announces the winner of this year's Great British Sewing Bee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0110466df9f48eb07a6e30ff4a8d4919c829874e","amp;dn":"The+Great+British+Sewing+Bee-S03E06--x264-HD-WebDL--STS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0110466df9f48eb07a6e30ff4a8d4919c829874e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,16,70,109,249,244,142,176,122,110,48,255,74,141,73,25,200,41,135,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
