By the age of 14 he was already leading his own bands (his first was Trio Carnival) and by the 1980s he had developed his unique bop-inflected and decidedly postmodern approach to the tango, an approach that has him artfully straddling the musical past, present, and future with casual yet acute balance. For all his association with the international avant-garde, Saluzzi still maintains his allegiance to the regional folk traditions of his youth, and that connection gives his sometimes fragmented compositions an uncommon center of gravity. Saluzzi's lengthy discography includes the albums Kultrum, Once Upon a Time -- Far Away in the South (both from 1985), Volver (1986), Andina (1988), Argentina (1990), Mojotoro (1991), Rios (1995), Cite de la Musique (1997), Senderos (2005), Juan Condori (2006), and Ojos Negros (2007), most of which were released on the ECM imprint.\n-- allmusic.com\n\nAlbum review.\nMesmer would be proud. This album presents Saluzzi's bandoneon without accompaniment, unlike most of his recent work performed in a large or small group. The pieces are all cut of the same cloth and show a surprising sensitivity and what might be called 'songfullness'. Definitely worth having for those times when listening is on your agenda, and you can give your full attention. Best in the dark, on a quiet evening.\n-- user review @ amazon.com\n\nTracks\n01- Dance\n02- Winter\n03- Transmutation\n04- Remoteness\n05- Tango Of Oblivion\n06- Choral\n07- Waltz For Verena\n08- Andina\n09- Memories\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:243fa4435cde37e26a4f34813be9dee04e0c1557","amp;dn":"Dino+Saluzzi+-+Andina+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"243fa4435cde37e26a4f34813be9dee04e0c1557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,63,164,67,92,222,55,226,106,79,52,129,59,233,222,224,78,12,21,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
