Carey Bell is definitely among them.\n\nHarpslinger is a combination of two recording sessions originally held in England in 1988 and 1989. Carey Bell is accompanied by his son Lurrie Bell on guitar among others. This is the period when Mr. Bell started his way up to the peak of his artistry, when he perfected his chirping and twittering and simultaneously powerful harp playing making it mesmerizing and mysterious at highest grade whatever the composition, venue, or studio work it was.\n\nThis album showcases Carey Bell's equally masterful performance whether it is Rabon Tarrant's 12-bar &quot;Blues With A Feeling&quot; or Little Walter's &quot;Last Night&quot;, or up-tempo &quot;Strange Woman&quot; or... better you name the song. Music-wise Blues is all about the feeling and Carey Bell's Blues is heartfelt, deep down, absorbed from origins and blowing out and waving like an ocean.\n\nThis is the musician who matters. This is the music that matters. This is the Blues.\n\npastblues.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b94cc4fbd4c536f273b65833522379b68572ea89","amp;dn":"Carey+Bell+-+Harpslinger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b94cc4fbd4c536f273b65833522379b68572ea89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,76,196,251,212,197,54,242,115,182,88,51,82,35,121,182,133,114,234,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
