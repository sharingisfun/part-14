Items of note are working auxillery intake doors on the upper and lower fuselage, pilots that disappear when the engines shut down, plus intake covers and other ancillary items that appear when you shut down the aircraft. \n\nFor the Royal Navy Phantom, we have modeled the aircraft to angle correctly when engaging the extendable nose leg prior to carrier launch. plus displaying the launch shuttle and harness wires for launching! \n\nWe have taken on board comments from FGR.2 customers and improved the virtual cockpit by increasing the resolution of the side consoles. Gone are the old FS98 coded gauges, we have created a whole new suite of gauges in XML format for higher resolution in 2D and VC views. \n\nOther features include working switches, radios, levers and other effects and silky smooth gauge refresh rates on most systems. Also included is a 2D panel which comes with a VFR view for flying fast down low, and an IFR panel popup with enlarged instruments for ease of use when navigating from place to place! Tour the world with the IRIS Phantom! \n\nThe exterior model has also retained our trademarked quality which has been built from a our established range of aircraft, and the product features a number of different models as has come to be expected from IRIS, including for the FIRST time in Flight Simulator, the EMI reconnaissance pod carried by the RAF Phantom FGR.2 in Germany during the Cold War! \n\nWe have also once again had the privilege to employ the sound genius of Christoffer Petersen who has provided us with some excellent sounds for the Phantom recorded from the real deal which I am sure will have you playing with that volume control! \n\nAnd for those of you with the latest version of Microsoft Flight Simulator, FSX, we have optimised and adjusted Chris&amp;#039; excellent soundset for the Phantom to fine form in FSX featuring full 360 degree sound panning! Now hear the roar of the engines from the rear of the aircraft and the turbine jet whine from the front. Those tower flybys will NEVER be the same again! \n\nOur resident artists have provided you with some new paintschemes of the FG.1 and FGR.2 during its service, from the well known to the unique ones not seen regularly including the famous &amp;#039;Black Mike&amp;#039; of 111 Squadron. \n\nIf you have any requests or questions regarding the IRIS Phantom FG.1, or other products available from IRIS Flight Simulation Software, please drop us an e-mail at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8febeef9e6ebcfe6fde6fcfce6e2fae3eefbe6e0e1fca1ece0e2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; or visit our forums at http://www.irissimulations.com/phpBB2/ \n\nBelow is a brief summary of the product and be sure to visit the screenshots forum to view our latest images of this magnificent aircraft! \n\n\n- 32 Bit cockpit textures for superb clarity in flight. \n- Backlit canopy gauges for accuate night-time flying \n- Interactive Virtual Cockpit including over 40 interactive objects. \n- GMax programmed XML parts such as correctly modelled Auxillery intake doors in both upper and lower fuselage surfaces, drooping ailerons on engine shutdown, correctly automated intake splitter plates and more. \n- Appearing Intake Covers, warning labels and disappearing pilots on engine shutdown. \n- Custom Soundpack designed by Christoffer Petersen made from actual recordings of the Phantom featuring new enhancements such as oxygen mask effects and more. \n- Full 360 degree sound panning for FSX only. \n- Loads of custom animations for the phantom, including working tailhook, control surfaces, refueling probe, pilot and wso canopies, speedbrakes and much much more. \n- Enhanced flight dynamics complete with full loadout details for user control of multiple configurations. \n- A total of eighteen superb quality external models featuring different loadouts for the most commonly used in RAF and RN service \n- Ten detailed textures for the RAF and RN Phantom from 700P, 767 and 892 Naval Air Squadrons of the Royal Navy, plus textures from 111 Squadron, 2(AC) Squadron, 4 Squadron and 43 Squadron of the Royal Air Force in both camouflage and air defence grey plus &amp;#039;Black Mike&amp;#039; of 111 Squadron! \n- HUGE value for money, over fifty combinations of the Phantom to pick from and fly! \n- Full effects suite consisting of specially designed afterburner effects, wingtip vorticies, upper wing shockwave effect and more... \n- Full paintkit in PSD format for use in Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro for repainters to use, complete with weathering, backgrounds and panel lines all predrawn for easy repaints! \n- Authentic new 2D panel with VFR and IFR views, plus popup windows and custom programmed XML gauges throughout. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b88477ea1aeb8ceaddb97f3be74523a8a34af6de","amp;dn":"FSX+IRIS+Phantom+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b88477ea1aeb8ceaddb97f3be74523a8a34af6de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,132,119,234,26,235,140,234,221,185,127,59,231,69,35,168,163,74,246,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
