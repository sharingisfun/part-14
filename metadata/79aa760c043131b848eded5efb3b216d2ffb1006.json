She is a werewolf who hosts a popular syndicated radio phone-in show based in Denver called &quot;The Midnight Hour&quot;. The program focuses on supernatural issues.\n\nThe only rip in this collection that is mine is Book 10 - it is among my first - please let me know if there are any issues.  Converted using SoundTaxi 128kbps\n\nMy thanks to the original uploaders for the rest of the series.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79aa760c043131b848eded5efb3b216d2ffb1006","amp;dn":"Carrie+Vaughn+-+Kitty+Norville+Series+1-11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79aa760c043131b848eded5efb3b216d2ffb1006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,170,118,12,4,49,49,184,72,237,237,94,251,59,33,109,47,251,16,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
