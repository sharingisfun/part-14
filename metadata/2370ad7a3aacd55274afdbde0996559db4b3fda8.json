The film is based on a story by Gerald Drayson Adams and Leo Katcher and stars Mark Stevens, Edmond O'Brien, Gale Storm, Donald Buka and Gale Robbins. \n\nThe film opens with an especially noirish sequence where Rocky and Dan respond to a report of suspicious activity at a warehouse. They discover two young women in a parked car on the lonely street outside the run down building, doing a piss-poor job looking out for their beaus up to no good inside. Rocky and Dan put the bracelets on the girls and make for the warehouse. Inside, they corner the suspects and short gunfight ensues Ã¢â‚¬â€ Rocky grazes one of the youths with a shot from his service piece. Back at the station, the delinquents put on a tough act, but one of the girls falls apart, pleading and Ã¢â‚¬Å“blubberingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (per Dan) to be let go. Though Rocky wonders about justice for a wayward teenager, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plain that age and gender donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t carry any water with Dan Ã¢â‚¬â€ stone-faced as the hysterical girl is taken into custody, screaming over and over Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to go to jail!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dragged away.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Unjustly overlooked, Between Midnight and Dawn is one of the strongest Ã¢â‚¬Å“BÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ films noirs. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With a screenplay full of hardboiled one-liners, assured direction, and outstanding performances from the two principals, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprising this noir is so often overlooked.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.33gb\nDuration.... 01:29:05\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 540\nData Rate.... 2015kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
