The earliest music is from 1950 BC (the oldest music with notation, from a cave in Egypt, track 20, about 43 seconds, on the album 'Music of the Ancient Sumerians, Egyptians, and Greeks'). The latest is from the Renaissance in Northern Europe (except for 3 tracks of John Kenneth Tavener on one of the 'In Nomine' albums. How did those get in there?).\n\nI've stopped seeding all my other torrents (that are fully distributed) and promise that I will not seed anything else until this torrent, and my BÃƒÂ©la BartÃƒÂ³k torrent, are fully distributed with multiple seeds!\n\nLazlo Toth\n\n(I'm now writing my name in blood on a document that my wife has thrust at me saying what I have just said to you!)\n\nHere is a directory list:\n\nAir(s) de Cour - FouchÃƒÂ©court\nAncient Sumerians-Egyptians-Greeks\nCalliope - Renaissance Revel\nCapilla Flamenca - A-La-Mi-Re Manuscripts\nChants de l'Ãƒâ€°glise de Rome - Peres\nFlemish Masters 17th-18th Centuries\nFretwork Consort of ViolsEnglish Viol\nFretwork Consort of ViolsIn Nomine\nFretwork Consort of ViolsTavener\nMonteverdi's Contemporaries - David Munrow, Morley Consort\nMotets (16) on Psalm 116 - Helbich\nMusic For Prince Charles - Parley of Instruments\nMusic of the Crusades - David Munrow, Early Music Consort of London\nO Dolorosa Gioia - Concerto Italiano\nPalacio song book- Ferdinand II &amp; Isabel I\nPiffaro - Flemish Renaissance Wind Music\nPiffaro - German Renaissance Wind Music\nPleasures of the Court - David Munrow, Early Music Consort of London &amp; Morley Consort\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55efd7b4d407117c8befb14ddbce6d0925c0f837","amp;dn":"Early+Music+Collection-EAC-LAME+VBR+%28lt%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55efd7b4d407117c8befb14ddbce6d0925c0f837","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,239,215,180,212,7,17,124,139,239,177,77,219,206,109,9,37,192,248,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
