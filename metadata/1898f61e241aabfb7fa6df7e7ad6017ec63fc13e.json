Sangoro Tanaka lives in just such a paradise. At 83, he's a guardian of one of Japan's secret water gardens. Here - over a thousand years - towns and villages have developed a unique system to make springs and water part of their homes. From inside these homes, the streams pour into Japan's largest freshwater lake, Lake Biwa - an area 5 times the size of Paris - near the ancient capital of Kyoto. This is a habitat so precious the Japanese have a special word for it: &quot;Satoyama&quot; - villages where mountains give way to plains. They are exceptional environments essential to both the people who maintain them and to the wildlife that now share them.\n\n\nTHE FIRST PART OF THIS DOCUMENTARY FILMED IN 1998 AS WELL AS PLENTY OF MORE HIGHRES MOVIES DEDICATED TO NATURE OF JAPAN CAN BE FOUND AMONG MY UPLOADS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1898f61e241aabfb7fa6df7e7ad6017ec63fc13e","amp;dn":"Satoyama%3A+Japan+s+Secret+Watergarden+-+part+II+%28BBC%2C+NHK%3B+2004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1898f61e241aabfb7fa6df7e7ad6017ec63fc13e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,152,246,30,36,26,171,251,127,166,223,126,122,214,1,126,198,63,193,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
