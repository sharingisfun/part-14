As Venturi's &quot;gentle manifesto for a nonstraightforward architecture,&quot; Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture expresses in the most compelling and original terms the postmodern rebellion against the purism of modernism. Three hundred and fifty architectural photographs serve as historical comparisons and illuminate the author's ideas on creating and experiencing architecture.\n\nIt is impossible to imagine the world of architecture in the last 20 years without Robert Venturi. His writings have played an overwhelming role in creating what we might call the post-modern impulse in architecture, the intellectual climate that eased architecture out of the straitjacket of orthodox modernism. Twenty-five years have passed since the Museum of Modern Art issued Mr. VenturiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgentle manifesto,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the book he titled Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture and that quarter-century has only confirmed the observation Vincent Scully made in his introduction to the original edition that the book is Ã¢â‚¬Ëœprobably the most important writing on the making of architecture since Le CorbusierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœVers une Architecture,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ of 1923.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Author\nRobert Venturi is a partner in the firm of Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Inc., Philadelphia. He has taught at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania, and was a Fellow and later Architect in Residence at the American Academy in Rome.
