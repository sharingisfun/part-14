The recording software was left running throughout the entire production and was later edited down to the most important points filling four hours for the DVD.\n\nSplit into sessions, the DVD covers the construction and production ethics used by todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s professional dance artists to create funky house. These sessions include what to listen for, the inspiration, the ideas, sampling, manipulation, pitching, frequency tuning and editing, vocals, building a groove, processing, effects, arrangement and mixing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d37c60361c7e3a97a76ff9891db9b3ac7975e4","amp;dn":"Dance+Music+Production+Vol.1%3A+Dance+Floor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d37c60361c7e3a97a76ff9891db9b3ac7975e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,211,124,96,54,28,126,58,151,167,111,249,137,29,185,179,172,121,117,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
