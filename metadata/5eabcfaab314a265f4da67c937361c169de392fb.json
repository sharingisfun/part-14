A team of archaeologists, historians and forensic experts is working to identify unknown soldiers and finally lay them to rest. Finding The Fallen is a documentary series that follows the work of this team as they move through time and across the battlefields of France and Belgium, releasing the fallen and their stories of courage and sacrifice from the mud of the First World War battles in which they fought and died.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Loos 1915 - the Underground War \nTunnels and craters in the heart of a French coalfield hide horrors from the First World War. More than 50,000 British soldiers were killed or wounded here in a hellish battle that moved underground. Our team of archaeologists, historians, and forensic experts is here to excavate the lip of a gigantic crater that was created by a massive underground explosion. They discover a mass grave and, within the burial site, clues to one of the fallen soldiers, a German from Bavaria. A simple uniform button, a regiment number on an epaulette, and a postcard inside a music book, lead to the identity of this soldier: a gifted violinist named Leopold Rotharmel turned warrior in the German unit that would later be called the Storm Troopers.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\nFinding-the-Fallen-Screen0.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen1.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen2.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen3.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen4.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen5.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen6.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen7.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen8.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen9.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen10.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen11.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen12.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen13.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen14.jpg Finding-the-Fallen-Screen15.jpg \n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2081 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.517:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:47.520\nNumber Of Parts: 5\nPart Size: 785 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eabcfaab314a265f4da67c937361c169de392fb","amp;dn":"DC+Finding+the+Fallen+3of5+Loos+1915+The+Underground+War+XviD+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eabcfaab314a265f4da67c937361c169de392fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,171,207,170,179,20,162,101,244,218,103,201,55,54,28,22,157,227,146,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
