However, the computer's mind told her the humans must be destroyed as weak, imperfect beings, and a race of super-humans, the Galerians, must be created. But Rion, the hero of the first game, destroyed Dorothy in a dramatic battle. Now Rion is brought back to life and learns that Dorothy was able to execute a destructive program before her death. Once again, Rion must face and defeat Dorothy's creations, the Galerians.\n\nGalerians Ash is an action-adventure along the lines of Resident Evil and other survival horror titles. Rion can fight enemies using various psychic techniques. The more he uses a technique, and the more damage he sustains, the more &quot;addicted&quot; he becomes, and when the addiction meter reaches the limit, his hit points get gradually depleted, and he cannot walk normally anymore. Like in other survival horror games, you rely heavily on healing and restoring items. Enemies also drop items that would raise Rion's maximum hit points or make his weapons stronger, in a RPG-like fashion.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Incredible graphics, heart-thumping gameplay and intense cinematic effects \n  immerse gamers in a frightening, action-packed world.\n\n* An epic struggle between man and machine, with heavy concepts derived from a\n  future world where mind and matter meld.\n\n* Unique arsenal of psychic powers and psychokinetic weaponry, with new and \n  improved weapons, pharmaceutical items and abilities.\n\n* Captivating cast of organic and artifically rendered good and evil, with new and \n  returning characters.\n\n* The next exciting Galerians chapter, full of twists on an already &quot;twisted&quot; \n  story.\n\n\nGame Description Galerians (PS1):\n\n500 years in the future, a boy wakes up in a hospital with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. Gradually, with the use of psychic powers, you find clues to unlock your past. \n\nPrimarily an adventure game, gameplay is very similar to the Resident Evil series, although the puzzles tend to be a bit more realistic. Galerians is also a fairly cinematic game, using many atmospheric cutscenes to unfold the story.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nFor PS2 Game (DVD):\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nIf Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.\n(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)\n\n\nFor PS1 Game (CD-R):\n\nBurn With Alcohol 120%, (Included in download).\n\nSet DataType to Playstation (Write Method Raw/Dao) and burn at 8x speed.\n\n(No CD-RW will not work).\n\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden CD/DVD Media to burn both games with for best quality, or if other media isn't working.\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61c123f69c2b9d35e8792df1040c808e2dae6409","amp;dn":"Galerians+%28Dual+Pack%29+%5BNtsc%5D+PS2+%26+PS1+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61c123f69c2b9d35e8792df1040c808e2dae6409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,193,35,246,156,43,157,53,232,121,45,241,4,12,128,142,45,174,100,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
