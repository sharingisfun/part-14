A big thank you to him for all his hard work.\n\nFirst part of a series of Vinyl-to-CD transfers of Classic Hendrix Bootlegs. \nTransferred from Mint &amp; Excellent condition vinyl albums. All albums normalized, \nbut otherwise left mainly as is - just a few very audible vinyl pops have been removed here and there.\n\nPlease note: Vinyl bootlegs were mostly pressed in low cost factories, and the quality of the LPs - although \nunplayed and untouched by human hands - weren't always the best. Some minor pops and clicks are present on some \nof these discs, as they were on the LPs when these initially were brand new. If minor clicks make you nervous, \nyou should definitely stay away from this set","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d3cbc3ae8257f7105c7bba1fa20858b533e6fa2","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+Original+Vinyl+Transfer+Series+1st+Batch-Pt.2+%2810","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d3cbc3ae8257f7105c7bba1fa20858b533e6fa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,60,188,58,232,37,127,113,5,199,187,161,250,32,133,139,83,62,111,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
