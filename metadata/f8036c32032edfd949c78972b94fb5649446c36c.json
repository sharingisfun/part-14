Their keyboardist uses the Korg MS2000 synthesizer to achieve a very 8-Bit videogame-influenced sound.\nHORSE the band have jokingly labeled themselves as nintendocore because of the references to certain Nintendo characters in some songs, including Cut Man, from the popular 8-bit NES game Mega Man in the song ?Cutsman?; Birdo, one of the bosses from the NES game Super Mario Bros. 2, in the song ?Birdo?; and the rabbit-like nemesis from Nintendo?s The Legend of Zelda in the song ?Pol?s Voice?.\n\nAlthough the focus of HORSE?s lyrics can be considered slightly trivial at times, often they are used metaphorically, to suggest other topics, personal or otherwise.\nNot all of HORSE the band?s lyrics reference video games. According to vocalist Nathan Winneke, ??There are only three of our songs which reference Nintendo characters. I was reading some review of our new album and this guy was trying to link all our songs to Nintendo, I was like, ?What the f**k!???? (Metal Hammer UK, www.metalhammer.co.uk)\n\nThe band booked their own DIY tours starting the summer of 2002, including a 3-month world tour spanning 7 countries. They headlined nearly all of the shows they played. After being picked up by the Agency Group, they began to appear on more legitimate packages, first touring with The Dillinger Escape Plan, Hella, and Between the Buried and Me in late 2005.
