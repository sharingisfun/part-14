Whatever about the main album the bonus cd is amazing, easily the best thing I have ever heard. I have tried to find anything similiar to this but have failed. I am an old pothead and only imagine that this is something modern called &quot;dope beatz&quot; or ambient or something like that - I don't know. I think it is just fantastic. It is in my mind the ultimate chill out album. If you see it get it - beg, borrow or steal. I actually think it is better than the main album and I know it is the only decent bonus cd I have ever bought.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed4b1ce6a8ce655f8dc3d24d4e08381adebcc135","amp;dn":"Freak+Power-The+Fried+Funk+Food+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed4b1ce6a8ce655f8dc3d24d4e08381adebcc135","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,75,28,230,168,206,101,95,141,195,210,77,78,8,56,26,222,188,193,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
