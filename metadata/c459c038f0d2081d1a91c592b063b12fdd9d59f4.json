You can find both .package and .Sim3Packs in seperate folders in the torrent. The .sim3pack's decrapified, and rigfixed, of course.\nIt's a month set, not like shits on TPB (missing items, previous month items,etc), if you want to get ALL the updates released in current month, always take mine. \n\nSo there's a FiXER_v7 folder in the torrent (which fixes the new bugged items), you have to use the .packages inside to get work some new items, which got fucked up, because of the decrapifier. If you do this right, everything is going to work.
