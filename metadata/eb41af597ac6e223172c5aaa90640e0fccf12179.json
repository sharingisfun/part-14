Mitzi (Wiley, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-470-40665-6\r\n\r\nDiscover the materials set to revolutionize the electronics industry\r\n\r\nThe search for electronic materials that can be cheaply solution-processed into films, while simultaneously providing quality device characteristics, represents a major challenge for materials scientists. Continuous semiconducting thin films with large carrier mobilities are particularly desirable for high-speed microelectronic applications, potentially providing new opportunities for the development of low-cost, large-area, flexible computing devices, displays, sensors, and solar cells.\r\n\r\nTo date, the majority of solution-processing research has focused on molecular and polymeric organic films. In contrast, this book reviews recent achievements in the search for solution-processed inorganic semiconductors and other critical electronic components. These components offer the potential for better performance and more robust thermal and mechanical stability than comparable organic-based systems.\r\n\r\nSolution Processing of Inorganic Materials covers everything from the more traditional fields of sol-gel processing and chemical bath deposition to the cutting-edge use of nanomaterials in thin-film deposition. In particular, the book focuses on materials and techniques that are compatible with high-throughput, low-cost, and low-temperature deposition processes such as spin coating, dip coating, printing, and stamping. Throughout the text, illustrations and examples of applications are provided to help the reader fully appreciate the concepts and opportunities involved in this exciting field.\r\n\r\nIn addition to presenting the state-of-the-art research, the book offers extensive background material. As a result, any researcher involved or interested in electronic device fabrication can turn to this book to become fully versed in the solution-processed inorganic materials that are set to revolutionize the electronics industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb41af597ac6e223172c5aaa90640e0fccf12179","amp;dn":"Solution+Processing+of+Inorganic+Materials+-+David+B.+Mitzi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb41af597ac6e223172c5aaa90640e0fccf12179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,65,175,89,122,198,226,35,23,44,90,170,144,100,14,15,204,241,33,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
