It is a kind of sequel to Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ALOHA JERRYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ CD (Audionics 2013-01-2) - once again dedicated to the eighth Las Vegas season.\n\n These recordings were captured almost a month to the day of the Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Aloha From HawaiiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ satellite broadcast, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inevitable to make some comparisons. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been said that Elvis was depressed about having to return to Las Vegas again following the huge success of the broadcast, but this newly discovered recording does not bear that out at all.\n\n Elvis sounds more relaxed and more at ease on this recording, and there is an intimacy present on this recording that is missing from Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½AlohaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interesting to note that many of the songs that he performed during the satellite show are missing here. In fact, the layout of the show is somewhat reminiscent of the structure of the Las Vegas shows in August 1970, with a strong mix of recent material and Elvis classics.\n\n All recordings presented on this CD are previously unreleased. The February 13th, 1973 dinner show is completely new even to die-hard Elvis fans. It was never in circulation and it is taken from an original Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½booth recording, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ made from a booth close to the stage and PA speakers. It is remarkably superior to usual audience tapes and soundwise fully comparable with our Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ALOHA, JERRYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Audionics 2013-01-2), February 23, 1973 Closing Night.\n\n As a bonus, more of SOUNDBOARD tracks from the Dinner Show of February 10th, 1973 are included. Only part of this show was recorded, using a bass-heavy mix, possibly as a guide for future Fender bass players if Scheff left the Elvis Presley Show. Other tracks from this concert were used as a bonus on our Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ALOHA, JERRY!Ã¢â‚¬Å“ release. Once again, this is a previously unknown recording.\n\n This release is presented in deluxe digipack with live and candid photos taken during January / February Ã¢â‚¬â„¢73 Vegas season and with appropriate liner notes. If you have enjoyed Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ALOHA, JERRY!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ then you will be not disappointed by Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ECHOES OF ALOHAÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½!  \n\nEnjoy!\nThanks to the original uploader!\nJeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:242be74ef51d2c81c133e1f4f51206764d17f6dc","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Echoes+of+Aloha+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"242be74ef51d2c81c133e1f4f51206764d17f6dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,43,231,78,245,29,44,129,193,51,225,244,245,18,6,118,77,23,246,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
