It took courage to write this book and it will take courage to read \n\nit. It will give you an extraordinary stimulus to think and reflect. Our inherited\n\nbeliefs are idols deeply rooted in our psyche and emotions. The breaking of\n\nthese idols is no less a calamity than breaking the stone idols of an idol\n\nworshiper. Therefore, this book is recommended only for the open-minded\n\nreader with considerable moral courage.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4109b45e746d77c9c2ef366bf5b5f2aa90110dc","amp;dn":"The+Criminals+of+Islam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4109b45e746d77c9c2ef366bf5b5f2aa90110dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,16,155,69,231,70,215,124,156,46,243,102,191,91,95,42,169,1,16,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
