He is regarded as one of the first contemporary writers of Arabic literature, along with Tawfiq el-Hakim, to explore themes of existentialism. He published 34 novels, over 350 short stories, dozens of movie scripts, and five plays over a 70-year career. Many of his works have been made into Egyptian and foreign films.\n\nMost of Mahfouz's early works were set in Cairo. Abath Al-Aqdar (Mockery of the Fates) (1939), Rhadopis (1943), and Kifah Tibah (The Struggle of Thebes) (1944), were historical novels, written as part of a larger unfulfilled project of 30 novels. Inspired by Sir Walter Scott (1771Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1832), Mahfouz planned to cover the entire history of Egypt in a series of books. However, following the third volume, he shifted his interest to the present and the psychological impact of social change on ordinary people. Mahfouz's prose is characterised by the blunt expression of his ideas. His written works covered a broad range of topics, including socialism, homosexuality, and God. Writing about some of these subjects was prohibited in Egypt. In his works, he described the development of his country in the 20th century and combined intellectual and cultural influences from East and West. His own exposure to the literature of non-Egyptian culture began in his youth with the enthusiastic consumption of Western detective stories, Russian classics, and such modernist writers as Marcel Proust, Franz Kafka and James Joyce. Mahfouz's stories are almost always set in the heavily populated urban quarters of Cairo, where his characters, mostly ordinary people, try to cope with the modernization of society and the temptations of Western values.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Adrift on the Nile\n\n* Akhenaten - Dweller in Truth a Novel\n\n* Before the Throne\n\n* Cairo Modern  \n\n* Cairo Trilogy\n\n  - Palace Walk (Cairo Trilogy, Part 1)\n\n  - Palace of Desire (Cairo Trilogy, Part 2)\n\n  - Sugar Street (Cairo Trilogy, Part 3)\n\n* Karnak Cafe\n\n* Khan Al-Khalili\n\n* Midaq Alley  \n\n* Morning and Evening Talk\n\n* Rhadopis of Nubia\n\n* The Day the Leader Was Killed \n\n* The Dreams\n\n* The Mirage\n  \n* The Seventh Heaven\n\n* The Thief &amp; the Dogs\n\n* Thebes at War\n\n* Three Novels of Ancient Egypt\n\n* Voices from the Other World\n \n===================================================================================\n\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naguib_Mahfouz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naguib_Mahfouz&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2062/the-art-of-fiction-no-129-naguib-mahfouz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2062/the-art-of-fiction-no-129-naguib-mahfouz&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1988/mahfouz-facts.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1988/mahfouz-facts.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400afd87449cc9e0e6509eaf177e1aa4c195383a","amp;dn":"Naguib+Mahfouz+-+Nobel+Prize+in+Literature%2C1988+%2820+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400afd87449cc9e0e6509eaf177e1aa4c195383a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,10,253,135,68,156,201,224,230,80,158,175,23,126,26,164,193,149,56,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
