It has few frills, but it does have some thrills, and in particular it has a cleverly written story that is told at a brisk pace, with a good deal of interesting and pleasingly macabre detail.\n\nFrederick Loren (Vincent Price) has invited five strangers to a party of a lifetime. He is offering each of them $10,000 if they can stay the night in a house. But the house is no ordinary house. This house has reputation for murder. Frederick offers them each a gun for protection. They will all arrived in a hearse and will either leave in it $10,000 richer or leave in it dead!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://akas.imdb.com/title/tt0051744/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://akas.imdb.com/title/tt0051744/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c85d2202580cc3277cebe0dda95410a83eec50b3","amp;dn":"The+House+on+Haunted+Hill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c85d2202580cc3277cebe0dda95410a83eec50b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,93,34,2,88,12,195,39,124,235,224,221,169,84,16,168,62,236,80,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
