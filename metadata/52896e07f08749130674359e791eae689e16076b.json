Not all tracks were originally released during that decade, and \nnot all were featured on the &quot;official&quot; soundtracks of their respective films. \nIn fact, not all the films featured had &quot;official&quot; soundtracks, but included \nsome of the songs you'll see here during the film itself.\n\nSome films have multiple tracks included in this set. Of these, two were ripped \ndirectly from the audio of DVDs that I own, while the rest were compiled from \nvarious sources and re-tagged as a custom compilation. I have included the track \nlisting in a separate PDF file. You'll need a PDF reader; if you don't have one,\nthere are plenty available for free on the Web. Acrobat, Foxit and Sumatra are\na few of the most popular. The track listing is also in a JPG for compatibility.\n\nPlease don't change the tags! As mentioned above, most of these are non-album \ntracks, and I believe many of the &quot;official&quot; soundtracks are out of print. Just \nqueue up the playlist in your favorite boombox -- I mean, media player, kick up \nyour Adidas, grab your favorite soft drink (anything but New Coke), and enjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52896e07f08749130674359e791eae689e16076b","amp;dn":"50+Best+1980s+Teen+Movie+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52896e07f08749130674359e791eae689e16076b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,137,110,7,240,135,73,19,6,116,53,158,121,30,174,104,158,22,7,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
