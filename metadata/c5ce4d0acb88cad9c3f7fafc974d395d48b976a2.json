Jocelyn Bell Burnell.\nProfessor Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell describes how she discovered pulsars, the by-products of supernova explosions which make life in the universe possible. She describes the moments of despair and jubilation as the discovery unfolded and her excitement as pulsars took the scientific world by storm. Reflecting on the nature of scientific discovery, she talks about the connections between religion and science and how she sees science as a search for understanding rather than as a quest for truth.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ry9jq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ry9jq&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1404 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: HE-AAC v1\nAudio Bitrate: 96 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nRunTime Per Part: 59 mins\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 630 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: PDTV\n\nSRT available from MVGroup\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5ce4d0acb88cad9c3f7fafc974d395d48b976a2","amp;dn":"BBC+Beautiful+Minds+1of3+468p+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5ce4d0acb88cad9c3f7fafc974d395d48b976a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,206,77,10,203,136,202,217,195,247,250,252,151,77,57,93,72,185,118,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
