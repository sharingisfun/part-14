In this compelling book, award-winning journalist Ray Moynihan teams up with drug assessment \nspecialist Barbara Mintzes to investigate the creation of female sexual dysfunction or FSD, and the marketing machine that promises to &quot;cure&quot; it. \nThe authors go inside the corridors of medical power to visit drug companyÃ¢â‚¬â€œsponsored scientific meetings and medical education events where doctors \nare being trained to see womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexual problems as the symptoms of FSD Ã¢â‚¬â€ a pharmaceutically treatable condition. Moynihan and Mintzes explore \nthe underlying causes of sexual dissatisfaction among women and expose how global drug companies exploit those problems in an attempt to create \nthe next billion dollar disease.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\n&quot;LIVE AND LET LIVE&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33275cdfca86e915961cfa40aca5e3cc83e3e257","amp;dn":"Sex%2C+Lies%2C+and+Pharmaceuticals-+How+Drug+Companies+Plan+to+Profi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33275cdfca86e915961cfa40aca5e3cc83e3e257","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,39,92,223,202,134,233,21,150,28,250,64,172,165,227,204,131,227,226,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
