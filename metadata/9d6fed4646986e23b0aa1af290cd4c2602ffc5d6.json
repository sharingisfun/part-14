Whenever a sequence of interdependent decisions occurs, making a single decision raises the need for anticipation of its future impact on the entire decision process. Anticipatory support is needed for a broad variety of dynamic and stochastic decision problems from different operational contexts such as finance, energy management, manufacturing and transportation. Example problems include asset allocation, feed-in of electricity produced by wind power as well as scheduling and routing. All these problems entail a sequence of decisions contributing to an overall goal and taking place in the course of a certain period of time. Each of the decisions is derived by solution of an optimization problem. As a consequence a stochastic and dynamic decision problem resolves into a series of optimization problems to be formulated and solved by anticipation of the remaining decision process.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6fed4646986e23b0aa1af290cd4c2602ffc5d6","amp;dn":"Anticipatory+Optimization+for+Dynamic+Decision+Making+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d6fed4646986e23b0aa1af290cd4c2602ffc5d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,111,237,70,70,152,110,35,176,170,26,242,144,205,76,38,2,255,197,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
