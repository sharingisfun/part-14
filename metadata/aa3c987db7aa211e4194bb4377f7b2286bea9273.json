Several of his works, notably his novels Satantango (SÃƒÂ¡tÃƒÂ¡ntangÃƒÂ³) (1985) and The Melancholy of Resistance (Az ellenÃƒÂ¡llÃƒÂ¡s melankÃƒÂ³liÃƒÂ¡ja) (1989) have been turned into feature films by Hungarian film director BÃƒÂ©la Tarr. Krasznahorkai has been honoured with numerous literary prizes, among them the highest award of the Hungarian state, the Kossuth Prize.\n\nKrasznahorkai's works have had a limited audience outside of Hungary and Germany. Only with recent translations of Satantango, The Melancholy of Resistance, War and War, Seiobo There Below, as well as Animalinside (a collaboration with artist Max Neumann) in English by George Szirtes and Ottilie Mulzet and published by New Directions has his work received critical notice in the United States. Further, because BÃƒÂ©la Tarr's films are limited in distribution and seen as experimental and intellectually opaque, his impact on film has not received much popular notice.\n\nSeiobo -- a Japanese goddess -- has a peach tree in her garden that blossoms once every three thousand years: its fruit brings immortality. In Seiobo There Below, we see her returning again and again to mortal realms, searching for a glimpse of perfection. Beauty, in Krasznahorkai's new novel, reflects, however fleetingly, the sacred -- even if we are mostly unable to bear it. Seiobo shows us an ancient Buddha being restored; Perugino managing his workshop; a Japanese Noh actor rehearsing; a fanatic of Baroque music lecturing a handful of old villagers; tourists intruding into the rituals of Japan's most sacred shrine; a heron hunting.... Over these scenes and more -- structured by the Fibonacci sequence -- Seiobo hovers, watching it all.\n\n================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following book in ePUB format:\n\n* Seiobo There Below - Laszlo Krasznahorkai, Translated from the Hungarian by Ottilie Mulzet (2013, New Directions)\n\n================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Krasznahorkai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Krasznahorkai&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/laszlo-krasznahorkai-interview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/laszlo-krasznahorkai-interview&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2011/07/04/110704crat_atlarge_wood&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2011/07/04/110704crat_atlarge_wood&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thewhitereview.org/interviews/interview-with-laszlo-krasznahorkai/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thewhitereview.org/interviews/interview-with-laszlo-krasznahorkai/&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musicandliterature.org/features/2013/12/11/a-conversation-with-lszl-krasznahorkai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musicandliterature.org/features/2013/12/11/a-conversation-with-lszl-krasznahorkai&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================================================================================\n\nFor Laszlo Krasznahorkai's other works see:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10285071/Laszlo_Krasznahorkai_-_Hungarian_Author__(3_books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10285071/Laszlo_Krasznahorkai_-_Hungarian_Author__(3_books)&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa3c987db7aa211e4194bb4377f7b2286bea9273","amp;dn":"Seiobo+There+Below+-+Best+Translated+Book+Award+Winner%2C+2014+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa3c987db7aa211e4194bb4377f7b2286bea9273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,60,152,125,183,170,33,30,65,148,187,67,119,247,178,40,107,234,146,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
