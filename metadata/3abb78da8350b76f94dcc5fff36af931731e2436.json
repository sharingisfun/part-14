But when an eccentric old woman named Mariah gives Griffin a box of shiny pennies, it sets in motion a desperate quest. The old woman was a wish stealer, who stole each penny from a wishing fountain decades earlier. Somehow, Griffin has to redeem the lost wishes, or the opposite of her own wishes will come true--and it could literally be a matter of life or death. Griffin's mission to right Mariah's awful wrongs allows her to meet some extraordinary people, and to do good beyond her wildest imagination. But can she do enough to reverse the curse in time to save the people she loves the most?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3abb78da8350b76f94dcc5fff36af931731e2436","amp;dn":"The+Wish+Stealers+-+Tracy+Trivas.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3abb78da8350b76f94dcc5fff36af931731e2436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,187,120,218,131,80,183,111,148,220,197,255,243,106,249,49,115,30,36,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
