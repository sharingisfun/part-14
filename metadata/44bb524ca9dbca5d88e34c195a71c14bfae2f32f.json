Blending bluegrass with folk, Krauss was instantly acclaimed from the start of her career, but it wasn't until her platinum-selling 1995 compilation Now That I've Found You that she became a mainstream star. Between her 1987 debut Too Late to Cry and Now That I've Found You, she matured from a child prodigy to a versatile, ambitious, and diverse musician and, in the process, made some of the freshest bluegrass of the late '80s and early '90s. \n\nWhen she was five years old, Krauss began playing the violin, taking classical lessons. She soon tired of the regimen of classical playing and began performing country and bluegrass licks. At the age of eight, she began entering talent contests in and around her native Champaign, IL. Two years later, she had her own band. In 1983, when she was 12 years old, she won the Illinois State Fiddle Championship and the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass in America named her the Most Promising Fiddler in the Midwest. In 1985, Krauss made her recording debut on an album, playing on a record made by her brother Viktor, Jim Hoiles, and Bruce Weiss. The album was called Different Strokes and appeared on the independent Fiddle Tunes label. Later that year, she signed to Rounder Records. She was 14 years old at the time. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tRounder Records\nCat.#\t\t\t610 6552\t\t\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.86% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Simple Love\n02.Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us\n03.Let Me Touch You For Awhile\n04.The Lucky One\n05.So Long, So Wrong\n06.Empty Hearts\n07.Every Time You Say Goodbye\n08.Wish I Still Had You\n09.Broadway\n10.Baby, Now That I've Found You\n11.Sawing On The Strings\n12.Restless\n13.When You Say Nothing At All\n14.A Living Prayer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44bb524ca9dbca5d88e34c195a71c14bfae2f32f","amp;dn":"Alison+Krauss+Essential+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44bb524ca9dbca5d88e34c195a71c14bfae2f32f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,187,82,76,169,219,202,93,136,227,76,25,90,113,193,75,250,226,243,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
