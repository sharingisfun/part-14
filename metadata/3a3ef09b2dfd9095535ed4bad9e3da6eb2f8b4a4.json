It was recorded around the time of his divorce from Janet Planet, the same woman to whom he had dedicated the passionate love songs of 1971's &amp;quot;Tupelo Honey.&amp;quot; This album is emotionally wrenching, a powerful statement on love gone bad. The melancholy mood of Veeden Fleece compels the listener to enter the singer's world of heartbreak. Though occasionally verging on the depressing, there is such immediacy and honesty in the music that you can't help but feel alive after a listen. Spare and subtle moments abound, such as &amp;quot;Fair Play,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Streets of Arklow,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Country Fair.&amp;quot; He pulls no punches in his tortured and confessional &amp;quot;Cul de Sac.&amp;quot; Irish spiritualism melds with the flow of jazz and the compelling power of soul music, forming one perfectly realized recording. This was the final installment of Van's unparalleled 1968-1974 period, and would be followed by his mysterious three year absence from the music world.\n\nVan Morrison\nVeedon Fleece (1974)\nCD to mp3 @ 320 kbps + covers\n\n01 Fair Play \n02 Linden Arden Stole The Highlights \n03 Who Was That Masked Man \n04 Streets Of Arklow \n05 You Don't Pull No Punches But You Don't Push The River \n06 Bulbs \n07 Cul De Sac \n08 Comfort You \n09 Come Here My Love \n10 Country Fair \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a3ef09b2dfd9095535ed4bad9e3da6eb2f8b4a4","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Veedon+Fleece+%281974%29+%2B+covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a3ef09b2dfd9095535ed4bad9e3da6eb2f8b4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,62,240,155,45,253,144,149,83,94,212,186,217,227,218,110,178,248,180,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
