Sam and the rest of the crew, Fire Officer Steele and Fireman &quot;Elvis&amp;#039; Cridlington are ever ready to speed into action at the first sign of an emergency. Sam is also joined by a host of fun and engaging new characters including a new Mountain Rescue Station manned by the rugged Tom Thomas and a stray but talented dog, Dusty.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0432870f8f353cef071444c8d6fb96f73d381f29","amp;dn":"Fireman.Sam.To.The.Rescue%5B2005%5D-Bearmeister.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0432870f8f353cef071444c8d6fb96f73d381f29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,50,135,15,143,53,60,239,7,20,68,200,214,251,150,247,61,56,31,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
