DMZ and The Massive creator Brian Wood launched an all-out assault on the comics medium in 1997 with Channel Zero, an influential, forward-thinking series that combined art, politics, and graphic design in a unique way. Touching on themes of freedom of expression, hacking, cutting-edge media manipulation, and police surveillance, it remains as relevant today as it did back then.\n\nThe Channel Zero collection contains the original series, the prequel graphic novel Jennie One (illustrated by Becky Cloonan), the best of the two Public Domain design books, and almost fifteen years of extras, rarities, short stories, and unused art. Also featuring the now-classic Warren Ellis introduction and an all-new cover by Wood, this is the must-have edition. See where it all began!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about anger as a positive force of creation . . . SomeoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remembered what comics are for. Meet Brian Wood.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Warren Ellis\n\n\nDescription:\n\nBig Brother meets Dark Angel in New York City\n\nSpecial interest groups have bullied the government into passing the Clean Act, effectively killing freedom of speech and silencing the country into submission. TV and God become one and the same as America wages its own Holy War against its citizens. Meet Jennie 2.5, media slut turned info-terrorist, out to save the country from itself, and restore free will and self-expression.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e921d409ac53c9cadb73d8b7957f556b3d9e8f5","amp;dn":"Channel+Zero+-+The+Complete+Collection+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e921d409ac53c9cadb73d8b7957f556b3d9e8f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,146,29,64,154,197,60,156,173,183,61,139,121,87,245,86,179,217,232,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
