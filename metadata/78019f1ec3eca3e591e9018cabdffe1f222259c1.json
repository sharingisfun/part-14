These subjects are familiar: portfolio choice, trading volume, the risk-return tradeoff, option pricing, bond yields, and the management, supervision, and measurement of extreme and infrequent risks. Yet their treatments are exceptional, drawing on current data and evidence to reflect recent events and scholarship. A landmark in its coverage, this volume should propel financial econometric research for years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78019f1ec3eca3e591e9018cabdffe1f222259c1","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Financial+Econometrics%2C+Volume+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78019f1ec3eca3e591e9018cabdffe1f222259c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,1,159,30,195,236,163,229,145,233,1,140,171,223,254,31,34,34,89,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
