The software is nearly ubiquitous and understanding its capabilities is an enormous benefit to engineers in almost any field and at all levels of experience. What Every Engineer Should Know About Excel offers in nine self-contained chapters a practical guide to the features and functions that can be used, for example, to solve equations and systems of equations, build charts and graphs, create line drawings, and perform optimizations. The author uses examples and screenshots to walk you through the steps and build a strong understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWith this book, you will learn how toâ€¦\r\nSet up the keyboard for direct entry of most math and Greek symbols\r\nBuild a default scatter graph that is applicable to most simple presentations with little cosmetic modification\r\nApply many types of formats to adjust the cosmetics of graphs\r\nUse 3D surface and area charts for data and functional representations, with associated cosmetic adjustments\r\nCorrelate data with various types of functional relations\r\nUse line drawing tools to construct simple schematics or other diagrams\r\nSolve linear and nonlinear sets of equations using multiple methods\r\nCurve student grades using Excel probability functions\r\nModel device performance using different types of regression analysis involving multiple variables\r\nManipulate Excel financial functions\r\nCalculate retirement accumulation with variable contribution rate and retirement payouts to match increases in inflation\r\nApply Excel methods for optimization problems with both linear and nonlinear relations\r\nUse pivot tables to manipulate both experimental data and analytical relationships\r\nCalculate experimental uncertainties using Excel\r\nAnd much more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0306926f3938a311c055e51923570bb2e5acd9ce","amp;dn":"What+Every+Engineer+Should+Know+About+Excel+-+J.+P.+Holman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0306926f3938a311c055e51923570bb2e5acd9ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,6,146,111,57,56,163,17,192,85,229,25,35,87,11,178,229,172,217,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
