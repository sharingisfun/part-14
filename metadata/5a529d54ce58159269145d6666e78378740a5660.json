The band had by this time been trimmed into an incorruptible and totally buffed rock machine that night after night pumped out 20 of their world hits with an energy that seemed inexhaustible. The film really captures the ecstatic mood of a typical concert in South America in the spring 2012, from the introduction of &quot;Dressed for Success&quot; to the sing-along party in the final encore &quot;Church of Your Heart.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Dressed For Success\n02. Sleeping In My Car\n03. The Big L\n04. Silver Blue\n05. Stars\n06. She's Got Nothing On (But The Radio)\n07. Perfect Day\n08. Things Will Never Be The Same\n09.
