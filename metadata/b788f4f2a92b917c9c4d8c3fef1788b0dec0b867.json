Bach's Suites for Solo Cello (TEL3197802) was released in 2010 and went straight to the top of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillboardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ classical chart.\n\nLast year he brought out a critically acclaimed CD devoted to music for cello and piano by Brahms (TEL3266402). This, his latest release, features one of the most enduring works in the romantic repertoire, Antonin DvorakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cello Concerto. The orchestra on the disc, which also includes two of the composerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Symphonic Poems Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Water GoblinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“In NatureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s RealmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is the Indianapolis Symphony and the conductor is Jun MÃƒÂ¤rkl.\n\nZuill Bailey made his Telarc debut early in early 2009 with a CD called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Russian Masterpieces for CelloÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a disc which featured music by Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich.\n\nTowards the end of last year he joined forces with pianist Simone Dinnerstein in a critically acclaimed recording of BeethovenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complete works for piano and cello. Since then his recording of J S BachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cello suites has been a massive success particularly in the USA where it spent four weeks in a row at No. 1 on the Billboard classical chart, and even made the top 30 in the New Artists chart.\n\nAntonin DvorakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cello Concerto in B minor, Op. 104, B. 191 was written in 1894Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1895 for his friend, the cellist HanuÃ…Â¡ Wihan.
