Using irreverent wit, an engagingly personal style, and a battery of examples, Chang blasts holes in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“World Is FlatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ orthodoxy of Thomas Friedman and other liberal economists who argue that only unfettered capitalism and wide-open international trade can lift struggling nations out of poverty. On the contrary, Chang shows, todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic superpowersÃ¢â‚¬â€from the U.S. to Britain to his native KoreaÃ¢â‚¬â€all attained prosperity by shameless protectionism and government intervention in industry. We have conveniently forgotten this fact, telling ourselves a fairy tale about the magic of free trade andÃ¢â‚¬â€via our proxies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade OrganizationÃ¢â‚¬â€ramming policies that suit ourselves down the throat of the developing world.\n \nUnlike typical economists who construct models of how the marketplace should work, Chang examines the past: what has actually happened. His pungently contrarian history demolishes one pillar after another of free-market mythology. We treat patents and copyrights as sacrosanctÃ¢â‚¬â€but developed our own industries by studiously copying othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ technologies. We insist that centrally planned economies stifle growthÃ¢â‚¬â€but many developing countries had higher GDP growth before they were pressured into deregulating their economies. Both justice and common sense, Chang argues, demand that we reevaluate the policies we force on nations that are struggling to follow in our footsteps.\n\nPublisher: Bloomsbury Press; First Edition edition (December 26, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1596913991\nISBN-13: 978-1596913998\n\nee a tiny collection of my torrents.
