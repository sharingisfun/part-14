These forces -  what Nobelist Richard Feynman termed &quot;exchange forces&quot; -  can be up to a thousand times more powerful than the base magnet strength. With the camera running, one of the cars even accelerates from rest loaded with a 35-pound lead weight. Filmed at Virginia Tech over 20 years ago and hosted by dr. Gerhard Beyer, Distinguished Professor and co-researcher (one of the original atomic bomb scientists), it also shows how the team of Beyer, Johnson and Davis actually performed their ground-breaking work of mapping the real magnetic fields surrounding magnets. These are actually very different and much more complex than what most of us have been taught. The surprising data revealed by these plots underpins the magnetic gate prototype. The video also offers some provocative end notes that further explain the pioneer work of world-renowned magnetism researcher Howard Johnson. Discovering Magnetism is compelling viewing for the curious person of any age who wants to learn how things really work in the world of magnets. 20 min. long. A must see for everyone.\n\nVideo specs:\nVideo codec: divx, 720x480, 1200 bps\nAudio codec: mp3, 44kHz, Stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ecb2e70a54c05fa78188e83eca729d96cccae6e","amp;dn":"Discovering+Magnetism+-+Magnetic+Gates+%28Howard+Johnson%29+%282006%29.a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ecb2e70a54c05fa78188e83eca729d96cccae6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,203,46,112,165,76,5,250,120,24,142,131,236,167,41,217,108,204,174,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
