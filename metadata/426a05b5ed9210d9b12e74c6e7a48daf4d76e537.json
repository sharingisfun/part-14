They've always been something of a laughing stock in the metal community. They are however, a fantastic gateway band. If you want to get a youngster into death metal, SFU is the way to start them off. If you send someone straight into Dying Fetus, it can be quite overwhelming. Believe it or not, SFU were one of the bands that got me into death metal; so they'll always have a special place in my heart.\n\nEven though everyone laughed in their faces, they stuck to their guns for quite a few albums; 12 to be exact. And in 2012, they shocked the world. They detached the jaws from faces and tore the eyes out of many heads. The reason being, that they put out a GOOD album. And I do mean that. &quot;Undead&quot; (the predecessor to &quot;Unborn&quot;) is a very, very good death metal album. I won't go into too much detail, but I would recommend listening to it before this one, because the 2 were meant to go hand in hand. Considering the wide appreciation for &quot;Undead&quot;, it wasn't a huge surprise that the band wanted to make a follow up album. And lone behold, a year later, they brought us Unborn.\n review excerpt by Metal4Blood, \n\n                        \nTracklist\n\n01. Neuro Osmosis\n02. Prophecy\n03. Zombie Blood Curse\n04.
