This prompts Eliza to hire Henry Higenbottam (a modern day version of Henry Higgins), a marketing self-image guru who is left with the task of rebranding Eliza's image in the hopes to show her that there is more to life out there than just playing Candy Crush Saga with an iPhone and connecting with a Facebook page.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fc295d3243911d2470a33456c7cd38422e8f497","amp;dn":"Selfie.S01E07.HDTV.x264-KILLERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fc295d3243911d2470a33456c7cd38422e8f497","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,194,149,211,36,57,17,210,71,10,51,69,108,124,211,132,34,232,244,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
