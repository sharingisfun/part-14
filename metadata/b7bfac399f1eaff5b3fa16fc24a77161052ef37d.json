It's also filled with advanced features: two flashes, built-in high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, a burst mode, and a video mode that shoots 120 frames per second slow motion.\n\nIn this course, photographer, author, and educator Ben Long explores the iPhone 5s as a serious photographic instrument, using its built-in features as well as a hand-selected collection of accessories and apps that will extend your iPhone's power. He details the basics of shooting with the iPhone, and then delves into the camera's more advanced capabilities such as panoramas, HDR, and video. Ben also explores workflow issues, including editing, sharing, and printing photos and transferring them to a computer.\n\n\n- Greetings for Alina-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7bfac399f1eaff5b3fa16fc24a77161052ef37d","amp;dn":"+-+Shooting+with+the+iPhone+5s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7bfac399f1eaff5b3fa16fc24a77161052ef37d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,191,172,57,159,30,175,245,179,250,22,252,36,167,113,97,5,46,243,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
