An album I grew up playing every day, familiar as a pair of old shoes. Everything about it, the canned audience, Gene's worn out voice, thew abridged guitar and drum solos, is ingrained into my brain. Is it a good live album? Is it even live? That's for you to decide.\n\nBut Alive II isn't the Alive II that was originally planned. A whole album was mixed and assembled, then shelved, ultimately never to be released. The Lost Alive II has circulated amongst bootleggers for many years. This is actually a better album than the released one.\n\nSo what I've done here is to expand the released Alive II with the Lost Alive II. I've added songs that weren't there, longer solos, new sequencing, songs they avoided because they were already on Alive.\n\nBTW, It's certainly not all live. Hard Luck Woman and Tomorrow And Tonight were never played live before the album was released.\n\n01 Detroit Rock City\n02 King of the Nighttime World\n03 Take Me\n04 Ladies' Room\n05 Makin' Love\n06 Love Gun\n07 I Stole Your Love\n08 Christine Sixteen\n09 I Want You\n10 Shock Me\n11 Ace's Solo\n12 Hard Luck Woman\n13 Cold Gin\n14 Do You Love Me\n15 Calling Dr. Love\n16 Tomorrow and Tonight\n17 God of Thunder/drum solo\n18 Rock and Roll All Nite\n19 Beth\n20 Shout It Out Loud\n21 All American Man\n22 Rockin' In The USA\n23 Larger Than Life\n24 Rocket Ride\n25 Any Way You Want It","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9eb6f00c8cd893804190de6a5d9efe11a487d9","amp;dn":"KISS+-+Expanded+Alive+II+%28by+%7D%7Beywood%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9eb6f00c8cd893804190de6a5d9efe11a487d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,158,182,240,12,140,216,147,128,65,144,222,106,93,158,254,17,164,135,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
