A freak accident occurs while testing a new space walking suit and Jonathan is drifted away into space and is presumed dead by his colleagues. He is found alive and well nearly 25 years later thanks to the cold-sleep module connected to the suit. Three years later, Jonathan (now a private investigator working in the former Los Angeles) is visited by his former wife, Lorraine. She asks for Jonathan's help in solving the disappearance of her current husband, Kenzo Hojo, the only clues he left behind being a torn leaf, a set of capsules, and the word &quot;Plato&quot;. Jonathan is reluctant to take her case at first. However, after Lorraine leaves his office, she is attacked and murdered by a man in a black motorcycle suit. Jonathan, unable to catch the culprit, decides to fulfill his ex-wife's final request and travels to Beyond. There he is reunited with his former partner from his LAPD days, Ed Brown, who agrees to help Jonathan investigate the circumstances surrounding Hojo's disappearance and Lorraine's murder.\n\nHow to Play \n1) Run ePSXe.exe inside the Epsxe v.170 Folder\n2) Skip Config\n3) Click File &gt; Run ISO &gt; Policenauts Disc 1.iso\n4) Enjoy the Game\n\nForums:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.fuwanovel.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.fuwanovel.org&lt;/a&gt;\nPolicenauts page:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/144&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/144&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou may have to tamper with the Config.
