As they are visiting a small island village off the coast of west Australia, that is easier said than done. The weekend began with the aforementioned couple and their friends Louise and David sailing out to Rocknest Island to visit their friends Garth, a doctor, and Juliet. The island is truly beautiful, as is the watercolor-like cinematography, and everyone has a good time. It is Emma who drops the bomb, and even Harry is surprised, for he has made no plans for their ceremony. It turns out that neither of the island ministers can do the job on such short notice. Emma then drops another bomb, telling them that she is terminally ill. This galvanizes all to action, and in very little time and with much resourcefulness, the wedding takes place followed by a grand party.\n\nAlso known as: Bailando Bajo La Luz Del Faro, Majakan varjossa, Hennes sista ÃƒÂ¶nskan, ÃÂ¢ÃÂ°ÃÂ½Ã‘â€ Ã‘â€¹ Ã‘Æ’ ÃÂ¼ÃÂ°Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂºÃÂ°, Ã¤Â»Å Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥ï¿½ÂªÃ§Ë†Â±Ã¤Â½Â , Ã¨Ë†Å¾Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ï¿½Â¯Ã§ï¿½Â«Ã©Ëœâ€˜Ã§ï¿½Å Ã¥Â¤â€ž.\nCountry: Australia\nStudio: Lotteries Commission of West Australia, Silver Turtle\nDuration: 01:30:19\n\nInfo:\n\n[mediainfo]\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 3\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 30mn\nBit rate : 1 986 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 536 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.206\nStream size : 1.25 GiB (91%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 30mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 124 MiB (9%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duratio : 500 ms\nLanguage : English\n\n[/mediainfo]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797bd24bf7ef1d588b1fda6e39feea958d4f28b9","amp;dn":"Under+the+Lighthouse+Dancing+1997+DVDRip+XviD+Naomi+Watts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797bd24bf7ef1d588b1fda6e39feea958d4f28b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,123,210,75,247,239,29,88,139,31,218,110,57,254,234,149,141,79,40,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
