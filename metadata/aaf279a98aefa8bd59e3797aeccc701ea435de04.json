Mathematicians largely agreed that it was impossible to predict the probability of an occurrence. Then, in 1654, Blaise Pascal wrote to Pierre de Fermat explaining that he had discovered how to calculate risks. The two collaborated to develop what is now known as probability theory; a concept that allows us to think rationally about decisions and events.\n\nIn The Unfinished Game, Keith Devlin masterfully chronicles Pascal and Fermat's mathematical breakthrough, connecting a centuries-old discovery with its remarkable impact on the modern world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf279a98aefa8bd59e3797aeccc701ea435de04","amp;dn":"The+Letters+-+Pascal+and+Fermat+-+The+Unfinished+game+%282008%29+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf279a98aefa8bd59e3797aeccc701ea435de04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,242,121,169,138,239,168,189,89,227,121,122,236,204,112,30,164,53,222,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
