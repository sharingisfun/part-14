After the mayor chooses the winner, the teams get ready to sell and are given their Speed Bump. The teams must keep a minimum of five dishes on their menu for the rest of the race. On day two, the teams must use another famed Chicago food in all their dishes Ã¢â‚¬â€ polish sausage. Once the teams sell 300 sausages, they race to Mike Ditka's restaurant, where he himself awards the prize and punishment. The winning team will get a five-hour head start to the next city.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 22-Sep-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f5685ca011c1881b7b824c16b8d224750161f7f","amp;dn":"The.Great.Food.Truck.Race.S04E06.WS.DSR.x264-NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f5685ca011c1881b7b824c16b8d224750161f7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,86,133,202,1,28,24,129,183,184,36,193,107,141,34,71,80,22,31,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
