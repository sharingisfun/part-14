Pitney is sometimes characterized (or dismissed) as a shallow teen idol-type prone to operatic ballads. It's true that some of his biggest hits -- &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart,&quot; &quot;I'm Gonna Be Strong,&quot; &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love,&quot; and &quot;Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa&quot; -- are archetypes of adolescent or just-post-adolescent agony, characterized by longing and not a little self-pity.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Cub Koda):\n\nJust what the title implies, this Bear Family collection features a nice overview of the highs and lows from Pitney's lengthy career. Gathering up his earliest non-hit sides (some recording under different pseudonyms) along with some of his biggest hits, this provides us with a picture of an artist in development and eventually hitting his hitmaking stride. Along the way you're treated to the original demos of &quot;Hello, Mary Lou&quot; and &quot;Today's Teardrops,&quot; early duet sides as Jamie and Janie, a German sung version of &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; and other early rarities. A fascinating collection done up with usual Bear Family quality. A good one to add to any basic greatest hits collection.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/hits--misses-r206774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/hits--misses-r206774&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001B1G&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001B1G&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
