Like many of her peers in the so-called &quot;girl singer&quot; movement -- Doris Day, Kay Starr, Peggy Lee, Patti Page, et al. -- Clooney's style was grounded in jazz, particularly big-band swing. She wasn't an improviser or a technical virtuoso, and lacked the training to stand on an equal footing with the greatest true jazz singers. However, she sang with an effortless, spirited swing, and was everything else a great pop singer of her era should have been. Her phrasing and diction were flawless, and her voice was warm, smooth, and relaxed; moreover, she was a sensitive and emotionally committed interpreter of lyrics. Some of her biggest hits were dialect-filled novelty songs, like her star-making breakthrough &quot;Come On-a My House&quot; from 1951, but she generally preferred to tackle more sophisticated fare, and recorded with numerous duet partners, jazz orchestras, and top-tier arrangers. Changing tastes and various personal problems conspired to stall her career in the '60s, culminating in a nervous breakdown in 1968. However, she mounted a successful comeback in the late '70s, and continued to tour and record for Concord Jazz up until her death from lung cancer in 2002.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tVocal\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.You Started Something\n02.It's Like Taking Candy From A Baby\n03.Grieving For You\n04.A You're Adorable (The Alphabet Song)\n05.You're Just In Love\n06.Beautiful Brown Eyes\n07.Come On-A My House\n08.Mixed Emotions\n09.I'm Waiting Just For You\n10.If Teardrops Were Pennies\n11.I Wish I Wuz (Hi Ho Fiddle Dee Dee)\n12.Be My Life's Companion\n13.Tenderly\n14.Half As Much\n15.Botch-A-Me (Ba-Ba Baciami Piccina)\n16.Too Old To Cut The Mustard\n17.Blues In The Night\n18.Who Kissed Me Last Night\n19.You'll Never Know\n20.If I Had A Penny\n21.Hey There\n22.This Ole House\n23.Sisters\n24.Mambo Italiano\n25.Count Your Blessings (Instead Of Sheep)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6617831f16f0359727cc16593f6d9b668394d67a","amp;dn":"Rosemary+Clooney+-+Greatest+Hits+%5C%2748-%5C%2754+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6617831f16f0359727cc16593f6d9b668394d67a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,23,131,31,22,240,53,151,39,204,22,89,63,109,155,102,131,148,214,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
