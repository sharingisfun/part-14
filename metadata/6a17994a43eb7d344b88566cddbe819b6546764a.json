This\ncan be seen on 1973's Tanx, which included new guitar effects, chord changes,\nstring arrangements and other studio &quot;tricks&quot; Bolan had not employed before.\n\nHe had been listening to a sizable amount of US soul and R&amp;B, no doubt\ninfluenced by his new affair with a backup singer and clavinet player he had hired\nfor his 1973 US tour - Gloria Jones. These new sounds, in retrospect, were a year\nand a half before David Bowie's pioneering &quot;Young Americans&quot; album, often\ncredited with making the most successful transition from UK glam rock (which was\nlosing popularity) to radio-friendly, soul-influenced pop/rock. However, as\nsuccessful as Bolan was in combining his new influences with his old, the\nboogie/rockabilly sound at the core of the classic T.Rex sound can still be heard in\nthe guitar work and the harmonies,in particular on the track &quot;Nameless Wildness&quot;.\n\nThe songs reflect a darker mood than on Bolan's earlier releases, with lead track\n&quot;Venus Loon&quot; having quite grotesque subject matter. This was surely refective of\nBolan's inner uncertainty about his status in the rock world now that he was no\nlonger a teen idol. Other songs such as &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Change&quot; contain similar\nforebodings and dark imagery. The music, too, is ambitious and complex,\ncontaining some of Marc's most inventive extended guitar solos.\n\nThe album divided fans and critics into the two camps that would remain with him\nuntil his death - those that derided him as a washed-up teen idol, and those who\nbelieved he would eventually make a resurgence in popularity. At that moment,\nhowever, Zinc Alloy marked a downturn in his fortunes - the contemporaneous\nalbum single, &quot;Teenage Dream&quot;, made it only to #13 in the UK charts. While that\nwould be a success for most groups, Bolan had spent all of 1971-1973 enjoying\nconstant Top Ten and Top Five UK hits, including four #1's.\n\nT.Rex would not enjoy another Top 20 UK hit until &quot;New York City&quot;, in the summer\nof 1975..\n\n\n\n \nAll tracks composed by Marc Bolan.\n\n\n   1. &quot;Venus Loon&quot; ~ 3:01\n   2. &quot;Sound Pit&quot; ~ 2:50\n   3. &quot;Explosive Mouth&quot; ~ 2:26\n   4. &quot;Galaxy&quot; ~ 1:48\n   5. &quot;Change&quot; ~ 2:47\n   6. &quot;Nameless Wildness&quot; ~ 3:06\n   7. &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; ~ 5:45\n   8. &quot;Liquid Gang&quot; ~ 3:17\n   9. &quot;Carlisle Smith &amp; the Old One&quot; ~ 3:16\n  10. &quot;You've Got to Jive to Stay Alive - Spanish Midnight&quot; ~ 2:35\n  11. &quot;Interstellar Soul&quot; ~ 3:26\n  12. &quot;Painless Persuasion v. the Meathawk Immaculate&quot; ~ 3:26\n  13. &quot;The Avengers (Superbad)&quot; ~ 4:28\n  14. &quot;The Leopards Featuring Gardenia and the Mighty Slug&quot; ~ 3:36\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:46:19\nTotal Size...........: 308.14 MB\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll tracks accurately ripped\n\nNo errors occurred\n\nEnd of status report","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a17994a43eb7d344b88566cddbe819b6546764a","amp;dn":"T.Rex+-+Zinc+Alloy+-+1974+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a17994a43eb7d344b88566cddbe819b6546764a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,23,153,74,67,235,125,52,75,136,86,108,221,190,129,155,101,70,118,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
