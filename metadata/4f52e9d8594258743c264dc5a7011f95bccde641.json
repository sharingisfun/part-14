But what does this elusive idea really mean, and why has it become so important? This pacey introduction sheds new light on the issues involved, offering readers a comprehensive account of competing conceptions of global governance, and evaluating the ways in which rival theories strive to make sense of our complex world.\n\nIn a series of short, accessible chapters, Timothy Sinclair guides readers through the key perspectives on this crucial topic. In each, he assesses a range of actors and assumptions using real world issues - from global financial crisis and climate change to the politics of gender relations - to show how questions of global governance carry quite specific implications for the everyday lives of people in different parts of the world. Supplemented by thought-provoking Ã¢â‚¬Ëœproblems to considerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, as well as annotated reading guides at the end of each section, the book equips students to make up their own minds which approach or approaches might be cogent and for what purposes. Written with verve and clarity, this compelling introduction brings problems of global governance to life ably showing why and how they are both relevant and compelling for all citizens in the 21st century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f52e9d8594258743c264dc5a7011f95bccde641","amp;dn":"Global+Governance-+Sinclair+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f52e9d8594258743c264dc5a7011f95bccde641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,82,233,216,89,66,88,116,60,38,77,197,167,1,31,149,188,205,230,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
