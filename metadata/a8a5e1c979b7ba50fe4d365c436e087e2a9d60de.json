At the age of fourteen, Sappho is seduced by the beautiful poet Alcaeus, plots with him to overthrow the dictator of their island, and is caught and married off to a repellent older man in hopes that matrimony will keep her out of trouble. Instead, it starts her off on a series of amorous adventures with both men and women, taking her from Delphi to Egypt, and even to the Land of the Amazons and the shadowy realm of Hades.\n\nErica JongÃ¢â‚¬â€always our keenest-eyed chronicler of the wonders and vagaries of sex and loveÃ¢â‚¬â€has found the perfect subject for a witty and sensuous tale of a passionate woman ahead of her time. A generation of readers who have been moved to laughter and recognition by Jong's heroines will be enchanted anew by her re-creation of the immortal poet.\nGenre: Historical Fiction ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a5e1c979b7ba50fe4d365c436e087e2a9d60de","amp;dn":"Sappho%27s+Leap+by+Erica+Jong.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a5e1c979b7ba50fe4d365c436e087e2a9d60de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,165,225,201,121,183,186,80,254,77,54,92,67,110,8,126,42,157,96,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
