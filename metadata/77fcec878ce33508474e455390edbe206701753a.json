Between 1968 and 1973, Ten Years After scored eight Top 40 albums on the UK Albums Chart. In addition they had twelve albums enter the US Billboard 200, and are best known for tracks such as &quot;I'm Going Home&quot;, &quot;Hear Me Calling&quot;, &quot;I'd Love to Change the World&quot; and &quot;Love Like a Man&quot;.\n\nThe band subsequently broke up after their final 1974 Columbia album, Positive Vibrations.
