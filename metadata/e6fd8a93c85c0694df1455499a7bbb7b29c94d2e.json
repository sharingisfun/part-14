Eric Clapton had the biggest reputation, having established himself as a guitar hero first with the Yardbirds, and then in a more blues-intensive environment with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. (In the States, however, he was all but unknown, having left the Yardbirds before &quot;For Your Love&quot; made the American Top Ten.) Bassist/singer Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker had both been in the Graham Bond Organisation, an underrated British R&amp;B combo that drew extensively upon the jazz backgrounds of the musicians. Bruce had also been, very briefly, a member of the Bluesbreakers along with Clapton, and also briefly a member of Manfred Mann when he became especially eager to pay the rent. \n\n\nGenre................: Classic Rock\nYear.................: 2005\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Covers, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\nCD1 - In The Studio\n\n01.I Feel Free\n02.N.S.U.\n03.Sweet Wine\n04.I'm So Glad\n05.Strange Brew\n06.Sunshine Of Your Love\n07.World Of Pain\n08.Tales Of Brave Ulysses\n09.Swlabr\n10.We're Going Wrong\n11.White Room\n12.Sitting On Top Of The World\n13.Passing The Time\n14.Politician\n15.Those Were The Days\n16.Born Under A Bad Sign\n17.Deserted Cities Of The Heart\n18.Anyone For Tennis\n19.Badge\n20.Doing That Scrapyard Thing\n21.What A Bringdown\n\n\nCD2- Live\n\n01.N.S.U.
