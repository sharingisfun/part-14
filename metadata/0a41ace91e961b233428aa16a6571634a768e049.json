They have been     |\n|  touring all around Sweden and earned a reputation as a solid live rock    |\n|  act.                                                                      |\n|                                                                            |\n|  Their first demo, &quot;Old&quot; was recorded in 2000. The result was a 5-track    |\n|  CD and only 500 copies were pressed, selling out immediately. With many   |\n|  successful gigs and increased popularity among fans the band were able    |\n|  to release some material on their own, including four EP's and one full   |\n|  album, which have sold 10.000 copies between them.                        |\n|                                                                            |\n|  Describing their sound as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhard rock with distinct pop influencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½        |\n|  Takida proceeded in 2005 to get signed to a record label and went on to   |\n|  record their debut album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMake You BreatheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which was released in Sweden  |\n|  in April 2006. &quot;Losing&quot; - the first single from the new album entered     |\n|  the Swedish charts at No. 2 and stayed in the top for weeks. The album    |\n|  grew to be a huge success and was the biggest selling hard rock album in  |\n|  Sweden of 2006.                                                           |\n|                                                                            |\n|  Continuous touring followed, but the band still made time to record       |\n|  their second album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBury The LiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which was released May 2007. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBury    |\n|  The Lies,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ continued in the same vein as the previous album, with         |\n|  infectious rhythms, guitar hooks that stick in your head and deeply       |\n|  personal lyrics and choruses.                                             |\n|                                                                            |\n|  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBury The Lies was pretty hard to record due to a lack of time,           |\n|  performance anxiety and an enormous pressure from the outside. Everybody  |\n|  in the band felt like it was now or never, and that sometimes made it     |\n|  hard to think straight about both music and lyrics. Parts of the album    |\n|  we had to sort of force through, but it was a good experience to work     |\n|  under pressure; it proved that we were capable of working under those     |\n|  circumstances.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                           |\n|                                                                            |\n|  The first single Halo quickly grew to be a hit in the rock radio          |\n|  circuit. The band now gets an official nod from the industry with two     |\n|  Swedish Grammy nominations. The second single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCurly SueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ became a huge   |\n|  radio hit and stayed 10 weeks as No. 1 on the Swedish Tracks Chart ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a    |\n|  national radio chart, voted for by the public.                            |\n|                                                                            |\n|  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnother positive experience in making this album was that everybody in   |\n|  the band contributed in writing all of the songs.
