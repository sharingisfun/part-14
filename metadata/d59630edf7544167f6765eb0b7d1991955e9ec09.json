You can see from this why silent movies were a special art form unto themselves. \n\nA grasping capitalist of the classic sort works all sorts of devious schemes, only to get his comeuppance in the end - or does he? That last shot is quite funny. It rather reminds me of Dr. Mabuse - The Gambler, which is considered a classic.\n\nAnother youtube reseed in mp4 format. The aspect ratio is wrong, but I didn't want to risk degrading the image by running it through SUPER converter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d59630edf7544167f6765eb0b7d1991955e9ec09","amp;dn":"L%27argent+%281928%29+Antonin+Artaud+Brigitte+Helm+Alfred+Abel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d59630edf7544167f6765eb0b7d1991955e9ec09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,150,48,237,247,84,65,103,246,118,94,176,183,209,153,25,85,233,236,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
