Before the band had even released a single, the U.K. weekly music press was proclaiming them as the &quot;Best New Band in Britain,&quot; but Suede managed to survive their heavy hype due to the songwriting team of vocalist Brett Anderson and guitarist Bernard Butler. Equally inspired by the glam crunch of David Bowie and the romantic bed-sit pop of the Smiths, Anderson and Butler developed a sweeping, guitar-heavy sound that was darkly sensual, sexually ambiguous, melodic, and unabashedly ambitious. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb7a3b1d7680a13849bfcd900df3866b7167d46b","amp;dn":"Suede+-+Bloodsports+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb7a3b1d7680a13849bfcd900df3866b7167d46b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,122,59,29,118,128,161,56,73,191,205,144,13,243,134,107,113,103,212,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
