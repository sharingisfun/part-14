Force: Animal Drawing is the comprehensive guide to developing artistic animals that are creative, dynamic and anatomical, bridging the gap between foundational art and advanced techniques. Artists and animators alike all find animal inspiration when animating characters- be they human or inhuman. For a unique 'larger than life' character, readers will learn to apply the unique facets of animal movement, locomotion, expressions, facial features, physical build and personality to their traditional and digital art.\n\nReaders will also adapt key industry tricks and techniques to personify animal animations with key characteristics of a human's face. Explore the practical application of force theories and learn from today's leading character designers with the included artist interviews and an extended video tutorial.\n\nFind inspiration in observation, and explore the artistic connection between a overzealous dog or dictatorial cat and your animations. Adapt key industry tricks and techniques to personify your animal animations with key characteristics of a specific person's face.\n\nReach new heights of dramatic and visual impact by applying locomotive animal anatomy as it relates to an animating and drawing with a specific focus on force, form and shape.\n\nGorgeously illustrated with both traditional and exaggerated observational life-drawing models, learn to apply the unique facets of animal movement, locomotion, expressions, facial features, physical build and personality to your animations.\n\nApply abstract force theories with practical techniques, artist interviews and real world experience with a hands-on video tutorial, created specifically for animating animal movement, form and personality.\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:647a5e3e27c42ac416c53a97c13f23950a00e786","amp;dn":"Force+Animal+Drawing+Animal+locomotion+and+design+concepts+for+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"647a5e3e27c42ac416c53a97c13f23950a00e786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,122,94,62,39,196,42,196,22,197,58,151,193,63,35,149,10,0,231,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
