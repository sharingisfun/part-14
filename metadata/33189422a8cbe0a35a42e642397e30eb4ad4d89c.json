Would she walk again? Speak? Her hard-won recovery, though far from complete, has now allowed her and Mark to ask larger questions that confront us as a nation: How can we address our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s epidemic of gun violence? How can we protect gun rights for law abiding citizens, while keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill? What can we do about gun trafficking and other threats to our communities?\n\nEnough goes behind the scenes of Gabby and MarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creation of Americans for Responsible Solutions, an organization dedicated to promoting responsible gun ownership and encouraging lawmakers to find solutions to gun violence, despite their widespread fear of the gun lobby. As gun owners and strong supporters of the Second Amendment, Gabby and Mark offer a bold but sensible path forward, preserving the right to own guns for collection, recreation, and protection while taking common-sense actions to prevent the next Tucson, Aurora, or Newtown. Poll after poll shows that most Americans agree with Gabby and MarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reasonable proposals.\n\nAs the book follows Gabby and Mark from the halls of Congress to communities across the country, it provides an intimate window into the recovery of one of our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most inspiring public figures and reveals how she and her husband have taken on the role of co-advocates for one of the defining issues of our time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33189422a8cbe0a35a42e642397e30eb4ad4d89c","amp;dn":"Enough+-+Gabrielle+Giffords+and+Mark+Kelly+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33189422a8cbe0a35a42e642397e30eb4ad4d89c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,24,148,34,168,203,224,163,90,66,230,66,57,126,48,235,74,212,216,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
