Peter Singer, Tom Regan and other philosophers associated with the\nso-called animal rights movementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which is probably better referred to as the\nanimal protection movement, given that not all of its adherents employ a theory of\nrightsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½have advocated vegetarianism and veganism as the dietary embodiments\nof their philosophies. On the other side of the debate, philosophers who have\nchallenged animal protection often argue that animals occupy a minimal to nonexistent moral status, and go on to invoke this as a premise in a defense of\nmeat-eating. Despite the disagreements between the two camps, both take it for\ngranted that the philosophy of animal protection and the practice of avoiding meat\nrise and fall together.\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3879a6a87327b291c059a9deee253fbb84c7bc2","amp;dn":"Food+Fight%21+Davis+versus+Regan+on+the+Ethics+of+Eating+Beef","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3879a6a87327b291c059a9deee253fbb84c7bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,135,154,106,135,50,123,41,28,5,154,157,238,226,83,251,184,76,123,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
