The man himself emerges as one of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most remarkable self-creations, a prosperous lawyer who became an ascetic in a loincloth wholly dedicated to political and social action. Lelyveld leads us step-by-step through the heroicÃ¢â‚¬â€and tragicÃ¢â‚¬â€last months of this selfless leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long campaign when his nonviolent efforts culminated in the partition of India, the creation of Pakistan, and a bloodbath of ethnic cleansing that ended only with his own assassination. \n\nIndia and its politicians were ready to place Gandhi on a pedestal as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Father of the NationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but were less inclined to embrace his teachings. Muslim support, crucial in his rise to leadership, soon waned, and the oppressed untouchablesÃ¢â‚¬â€for whom Gandhi spoke to Hindus as a wholeÃ¢â‚¬â€produced their own leaders. \n\nHere is a vital, brilliant reconsideration of GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary struggles on two continents, of his fierce but, finally, unfulfilled hopes, and of his ever-evolving legacy, which more than six decades after his death still ensures his place as IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social conscienceÃ¢â‚¬â€and not just IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n\nBONUS:\n__\n\nThe Story of My Experiments with Truth (ePub + PDf)\n\nSeries: Vintage\nPaperback: 448 pages\nPublisher: Vintage; Reprint edition (April 3, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307389952\nISBN-13: 978-0307389954\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
