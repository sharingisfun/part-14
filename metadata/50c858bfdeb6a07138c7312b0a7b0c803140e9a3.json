Then the act has a comeback with another company. What do you do? Release a compilation of previously released tracks that are still available on various other albums. At least a few people will mistake it for new product and take it home.\n\nby William Ruhlmann, AMG\n\nIt's easy to see why someone who was in junior high in the 70's would love this CD. I certainly did. Each song takes you back to a time when life was definitely less hectic and, for this 40-something, much more romantic. Starting with &quot;Saturday in the Park&quot; from 1972, and with songs that were played constantly through 1979, Chicago has put together a greatest hits album which appears to be aimed specifically at those who graduated from high school some 20 or so years ago. How many of us heard &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; played by our high school bands at ballgames? That has to bring back some pretty great memories! With &quot;If you Leave me now,&quot; &quot;Wishing you were here,&quot; and &quot;I've Been Searching&quot; used to cover the sentimental loves of our youths, Chicago gives us a chance to reacapture that innocent love of life, and with &quot;Song for You&quot; as the last song on the CD, gives us some hope that there is still that lasting love out there somewhere. This is a great CD that continually plays at my home....in my car....at the office.\n\nBy A Customer, amazon\n\nI've always enjoyed Chicago's lush sound with the horns and vocals. This album really covers a lot of what makes the band so great. From the title ballad, which really touches you even after many years, you move on to &quot;Saturday in the Park&quot; which really captures that carefree mood.\n\n&quot;Feelin' Stronger Everyday&quot; is not only a feel-good dancy song but has one of the best ending sequences of any song I've heard. Then of course there is the super-classic &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; which surely every classic song singer knows by heart :)\n\n&quot;Baby, what a big surprise&quot; is another classic that gets your heart going. There's something about truly each song here on this album. You can leave the CD in your stereo and play it each day, and find something in there to enjoy.\n\nHow can you even compare to the horns of &quot;Does anybody really know what time it is&quot; - never mind the lyrics, which get you thinking ...\n\nTrue classic work.\n\nBy Lisa Shea, amazon \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50c858bfdeb6a07138c7312b0a7b0c803140e9a3","amp;dn":"Chicago+-+If+You+Leave+Me+Now+%282014%29+%5BTeichiku+Records%5D+FLAC+Beo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50c858bfdeb6a07138c7312b0a7b0c803140e9a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,200,88,191,222,182,160,113,56,199,49,43,10,123,12,128,49,64,233,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
