The documentary features interviews with surviving ghetto residents and a re-enactment of testimony from Willy Wist, one of the camera operators who filmed scenes for Das Ghetto. It premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the &quot;World Cinema Documentary Editing Award&quot;, the film was released theatrically in the US on 18 August 2010.\n\nThe film's distributor, Oscilloscope, appealed to the MPAA over the film's R-Rating, but were unsuccessful in reclassifying the film. Oscilloscope says the R-rating is inconsistent with cultural norms because the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, which is visited by school children, has more graphic footage.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nAt the end of WWII, 60 minutes of raw film, having sat undisturbed in an East German archive, was discovered. Shot by the Nazis in Warsaw in May 1942, and labeled simply &quot;Ghetto,&quot; this footage quickly became a resource for historians seeking an authentic record of the Warsaw Ghetto. However, the later discovery of a long-missing reel, inclusive of multiple takes and cameraman staging scenes, complicated earlier readings of the footage.\n\nA FILM UNFINISHED presents the raw footage in its entirety, carefully noting fictionalized sequences (including a staged dinner party) falsely showing &quot;the good life&quot; enjoyed by Jewish urbanites, and probes deep into the making of a now-infamous Nazi propaganda film.\n\nA FILM UNFINISHED is a film of enormous import, documenting some of the worst horrors of our time and exposing the efforts of its perpetrators to propel their agenda and cast it in a favorable light.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97cfee4966fcbf290440ae15087335595ea95b42","amp;dn":"A+Film+Unfinished+%5BNazi+Propaganda+Footage%5D+2007+-+x.264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97cfee4966fcbf290440ae15087335595ea95b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,207,238,73,102,252,191,41,4,64,174,21,8,115,53,89,94,169,91,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
