This rich heritage of art should be made accessible to an audience which would be eager to share the esthetic and spiritual experiences inherent in prints if they were aware of this heritage. This book was designed to serve as a visual reminder that such great treasures do exist, and that many of them are within the means of almost everyone to own, contemplate, and enjoy. Unlike paintings in which only a single original exists and consequently becomes a rare and expensive object, prints are a multiple medium of expression. Except for print rarities that have been lost or destroyed by the ravages of time and accident, all prints exist in many proofs of a single subject.
