These movies proved popular enough that they were spun off into a series, which placed Kolchak in Chicago with the Independent News Service. Each week for 20 weeks he investigated various supernatural and supranatural creatures, ranging from aliens to vampires to Aztec sacrificial cults. \n---\n1. The Ripper   9/13/1974\nA serial killer who preys on women haunts Chicago, and Kolchak comes to believe that the killer is the original Jack the Ripper, a seemingly immortal killer who has slain women in many cities over the last century.\n\nThis was originally released on Demonoid and has been circulating sporadically via DHT. \nI thought it would be good to try to join the swarms together and give it new life. \nI&amp;#039;m sure Kolchak would approve. ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c76eb0ff8a35453b68aa50ff5aad1cd7d04b1d","amp;dn":"KOLCHAK+THE+NIGHT+STALKER+01+The+Ripper+%5Bretr%3Ftv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c76eb0ff8a35453b68aa50ff5aad1cd7d04b1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,199,110,176,255,138,53,69,59,104,170,80,255,90,173,28,215,208,75,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
