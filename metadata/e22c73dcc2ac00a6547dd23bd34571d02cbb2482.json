Representing the culmination of more than 10 years of sustained development, FL Studio 8 is now the most flexible virtual music studio in the industry. FL Studio is the most complete virtual studio currently available. It will play any sample file (wav), generator (softsynth), VSTi &amp; DXi) or midi instrument you feed it. You will be creating wav, mp3 or midi songs or loops only minutes after launching it.  \n \n\nFL Studio is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for Windows PCs (or Intel Mac/ Bootcamp). With a full feature-set and aggressive pricing (inc. lifetime free updates), FL Studio may be your ideal DAW! FL Studio can be used as a scratchpad for your ideas or to produce completely mastered tracks ready for publication. It&amp;#039;s up to you! \n\nFL Studio is a fully featured, open-architecture music creation and production environment for PC. No extra software is required to produce any style of music, as a complete kit of instruments and studio tools is included in the cost of the package. With the included plugins, sounds and tools the user can create complete songs, backing tracks, loops or sizzling beats. Completed songs can be saved to WAV, MP3, OGG, MIDI, ZIP or the native project format (.FLP). \n\nChief Software Architect, Didier Dambrin has realized his vision of creating an open-architecture virtual studio environment where the only constraint on the users is their own imagination. This philosophy is reflected in FL Studio 8GÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œs flexible audio and control data routing, free-form Playlist design and interoperability with industry standards (VST/VSTi/VST2, DXi, DXi2, Buzz, ReWire, MIDI, MP3, WAV, OGG). Didier notes GÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£We don&amp;#039;t try to protect our data &amp; come up with new formats only for marketing reasons. We use existing standards as much as possible, and allow FL Studio to be used as a plugin in other hostsGÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥. In version 8, particular emphasis has been given to improved workflow through enhanced interface design, so that ideas can be crystallized and creativity captured.\n\nFeaturs of FruityLoops Studio 8:\n\n\nInstruments\nMake virtually any sound. FL8 includes 29 virtual synthesizers covering acoustic/synthetic bass, electric guitar and plucked string simulation, sampler tools including piano, general sample playback, and beat-slicing, and a range of synthesis techniques (subtractive, modelling, FM, granular and additive). With FL Studios newest addition, FL Synthmaker - a fully modular environment, you can now create &amp; share your own FL instruments, effects &amp; dashboards without the need to write basic code.\n\nAudio Recording &amp; Editing\nCapture audio from a single vocalist or a full symphony orchestra. FL8 can record up to 64 simultaneous tracks of audio. The Playlist workspace can contain an unlimited number of audio tracks and allows you to arrange discrete audio events in any order or position the creative process dictates with complete flexibility. Audio tools allow the user to time-stretch, pitch-shift, beat-slice, chop, edit and creatively destruct audio. FL8 audio editing is further enhanced with Edison, the recording wave editor. Edison is a fully integrated audio editing and recording tool with spectral analysis, convolution reverb, loop-recording, loop-construction tools and moreGÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âª FL Studio imports/exports WAV, MP3 and OGG formats.\n\nSequencing\nRecord musical performances and ideas in the most logical way. FL8 functions as both a pattern and track based sequencer, depending on user preferences. Tools include an unlimited track Step-sequencer, an industry-leading Piano Roll and Automation Clips. FL Studio supports MIDI and input from all standard Controllers.\n\nFL8 is the fastest way from your brain to your speakers.\n\nArranging\nDetermine your own project design. In FL8, you decide how your project will be laid out. Unlike the competition, FL8&amp;#039;s Playlist is a totally flexible and virtually unbounded space where Note Pattern, Audio and Automation data can be arranged and edited to suit your creative ideas and preferred workflow.\n\nMixing/Mastering\nThe most powerful mixer in its class. FL8 includes an industry-leading 64 stereo track mixer. Each track can hold a stack of 8 effects (VST, DX or FL) and, if desired, be routed to any of the other 64 tracks or one of 4 dedicated &amp;#039;send&amp;#039; channels. The 44 included effects plugins span - Maximization, Limiting, Compression, Delay, Distortion, Equalization (graphic &amp; parametriuc), Filtering, Phasing, Flanging, Chorus, Vocoding and Reverb. These will take you from the creative broad-brush effects like reverb, through to the minutia of the mastering process with multiband compression/limiting and parametric EQ.\n\nKey new features and changes.
