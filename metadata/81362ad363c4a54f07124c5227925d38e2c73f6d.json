We love it because it has proved brilliantly adaptable, encompassing the Victorian parlour and modern open-plan living with equal ease.\r\nDan is in Toxteth, Liverpool 8. Famous for the riots that ripped it apart in the 1980s, Toxteth has a far richer and more varied history than that one tragic episode. Liverpool was the ultimate Victorian boom town, turned by trade and industry from provincial powerhouse into the second city of empire. 100,000 terraced houses were built to accommodate its vast workforce, with huge numbers in Toxteth. From a high of Victorian industry and immigration to a low of postwar decline, Toxteth's terraces have seen it all - even the 2015 Turner Prize, awarded for their remarkable 21st-century regeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/39/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1b/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2a/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/78/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/At-Home-with-the-British-Screen14.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~2860 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.24 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07c5zj1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81362ad363c4a54f07124c5227925d38e2c73f6d","amp;dn":"Dan+Cruickshank+At+Home+With+The+British+2of3+The+Terrace+720p+x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81362ad363c4a54f07124c5227925d38e2c73f6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,54,42,211,99,196,165,79,7,18,76,82,39,146,93,56,226,199,63,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
