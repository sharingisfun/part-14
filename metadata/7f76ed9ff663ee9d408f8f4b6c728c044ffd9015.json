The envoys from the Holy Roman-Emperor meet with Cardinal Wolsey and determine how to cement the treaty between the two nations. Anne catches the King&amp;#039;s notice in a play. The Emperor is invited to the King&amp;#039;s court. It is learned that the King of France knows of the treaty talks- and the Cardinal is quick to find a scapegoat. We learn more of why Anne&amp;#039;s father and uncle want her to seduce the King.\n\nWriter: Michael Hirst\nStar: \tSteven Waddington (Buckingham),  Sam Neill (Cardinal Wolsey),  Callum Blue ( Knivert),  Emmanuel Leconte (King Francis),  Henry Cavill (Charles Brandon),  Henry Czerny (Norfolk),  Jeremy Northam (Sir Thomas More),  Joe van Moyland ( Thomas Tallis),  Jonathan Rhys Meyers (King Henry VIII),  Kristen Holden-Ried (Compton),  Maria Doyle Kennedy (Queen Katherine),  Matt Ryan (Pace),  Natalie Dormer (Anne Boleyn),  Nick Dunning (Boleyn),  Perdita Weeks (Mary Boleyn)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f76ed9ff663ee9d408f8f4b6c728c044ffd9015","amp;dn":"The.Tudors.S01E03.DVDRip.XviD-BSGTV.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f76ed9ff663ee9d408f8f4b6c728c044ffd9015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,118,237,159,246,99,238,157,64,143,143,75,108,114,140,4,79,253,144,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
