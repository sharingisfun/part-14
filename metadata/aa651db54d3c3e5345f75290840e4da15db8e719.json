It contains new studio-recordings \nof old material, four new original recordings and one new cover song. \n\nIt is the last album of any form that BTO produced with newly written material. \nIt was not released on a large scale in the United States and is a hard to find album. \nAnd just as the past three BachmanÃ¢â‚¬â€œTurner Overdrive albums, \nit failed to break any charts nationally or internationally.\n\nThe song &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; on this album \ncame about originally because BTO played at an outdoor \nconcert in Sturgis, South Dakota for a biker event with \nEric Burdon of The Animals also on the bill. \nBurdon failed to play the Animals' smash hit \n&quot;The House of the Rising Sun,&quot; leaving the audience chanting, \n&quot;Play 'House'! Play 'House'!&quot;\n\n \nBTO had played the song on a semi-regular basis a few years before, \nand were told if they wanted to go home that night, \nthey had better play it.[1] Since that time, it became a favorite at BTO \n\n\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\n\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Trial By Fire Greatest &amp; Latest\nAlbum/Performer                          : BTO\nCompilation                              : Yes\nPerformer                                : Bachman Turner Overdrive\nPublisher                                : EMI\nGenre                                    : Rock/Hard Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2014\nWriting library                          : LAME3.99r\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\n\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nMusictime                                : Hour 01.
