Later that year, the solo single &quot;All Around the World&quot; gave Stansfield a tremendous boost by reaching number one in several countries, as well as in the U.K. From that point, throughout her distinguished -- if sporadic -- recording career, she was known for sophisticated, soul-inspired releases that appealed to a broad audience. She was the most convincing white R&amp;B singer since Teena Marie. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tMonkeynatra\nCatalog:\t\t0209042ERE\nIncludes:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue, Log\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Can't Dance\n02.Why\n03.So Be It\n04.Stupid Heart\n05.The Crown\n06.Picket Fence\n07.The Rain\n08.Conversation\n09.Carry On\n10.Love Can\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2612f44711028ffd00cdc627eb535b0dca52350a","amp;dn":"Lisa+Stansfield+-+Seven+%282014%29+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2612f44711028ffd00cdc627eb535b0dca52350a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,18,244,71,17,2,143,253,0,205,198,39,235,83,91,13,202,82,53,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
