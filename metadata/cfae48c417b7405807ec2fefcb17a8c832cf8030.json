Oh well, in any event\nwe thing the industry should be taxed out of these old recordings as &quot;time\nexpired&quot; for trying to cash in on them any further.\n\nthey are here for you at 160k bitrate to balance needs - although I must\nsay there are some real nice hits here, while a lot of the stuff will\nmainly appeal if you are completely into the music from this era and could never\nhave enough.
