The king banned performances of the opera, and Donizetti responded by removing large segments of the score for use in a different work, Buondelmonte. However, Maria Malibran (a famous mezzo-soprano who often sang soprano parts) forced a premiere at La Scala and ignored the censoring revisions, but a ban by the city was enforced.\n\nRealizing the impossibility of a run in Italy, a London premiere was planned, but Malibran's death at the age of 28 in 1836 cancelled the project. Except for several productions of the Buondelmonte version, the work was neglected until 1958 when a production in Bergamo, Donizetti's hometown, brought the original work into popularity. The premiere in England was held on March 1, 1966.\n\nWhen forced to simplify part of the music for the original Elisabetta, Donizetti scribbled on the margin &quot;But it's ugly!&quot;, and further on refused a change, writing &quot;Do it, and may you live for a hundred years!&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:621aa4692799aee4ea8efd1d3795713c9f4b4a05","amp;dn":"Donizetti+-+Maria+Stuarda++%281975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"621aa4692799aee4ea8efd1d3795713c9f4b4a05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,26,164,105,39,153,174,228,234,142,253,29,55,149,113,60,159,75,74,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
