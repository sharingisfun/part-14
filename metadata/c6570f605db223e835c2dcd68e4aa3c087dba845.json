All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as they could conflict or cause damage if run concurrently. The Microsoft Office Setup Customization Functions (Customize Setup Tab), AutoKMS Uninstaller (if AutoKMS is installed), AutoRearm Uninstaller (if AutoRearm is installed), Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Microsoft Office or Windows is not installed/supported. For information about individual functions, read further.\n\nRequirements:\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.0 or 4.5 (Not 3.5)\nMicrosoft Office 2010 or Later for Office Toolkit Support \nWindows Vista or Later for Windows Toolkit Support\n\n\nGeneral FAQ:\n\nMicrosoft Toolkit FAQ\n\nMy AV/Firewall Detected a Virus when activating.:  \nMost major AVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s have decided to flag KMSEmulator as a virus/hack tool, because it can be used for piracy and many AVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flag cracks. The file is completely safe but you must add it to your AV exclusions for proper use of KMS activation. \nSo add AutoKMS's (%WINDIR%AutoKMSAutoKMS.exe),  KMS Server Services's (%WINDIR%KMSServerServiceKMS Server Service.exe), and KMSEmulator's (%WINDIR%Microsoft.NETFrameworkv2.0.50727vbc.exe) path to AV/Firewall exclusions.\n\nCan I really trust these files?:\nThey are confirmed safe by MDL community and our reputations would be damaged if we were trying to infect you, but if you still donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust the files donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use KMS activation. You can use AutoRearm to keep Microsoft Office in grace period forever without any AV Configuration/False Positive hassles.\n\nI tried to activate via KMS and it failed.:\nFirst be 100% sure your AV and any security products (including built in Windows Products) are not interfering. \nIn any other case, please post to the forum with the output when you attempted activation.\n\nMicrosoft Office licensing is shot/Setup window shows on start of Office/I get red bar and nag.: \nIf your Microsoft Office licensing gets damaged or marked as tampered, Microsoft Office will try to repair itself and when it does you will be in Notifications Mode (with 0 rearms). The only way to resolve this is to activate Microsoft Office successfully (YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to use KMS due to lack of MAK/Retail keys). If you successfully activate youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be activated with 5 rearms. \n\nI have an issue or question not contained in this readme.:\nIf you are experiencing a problem and you have read through relevant parts of the readme (99% of questions I am asked are contained here in the readme so I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t answer those due to it being a lack of time and delaying those with questions/problems not in the readme. If you have a question that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t related to issues with activation troubleshooting, freely ask. Otherwise follow the troubleshooting steps so you can post all the info I need to help you.\n\nTroubleshooting/Support Guide\n\nGeneral:\n1. Please do not send support requests via PM. My PM fills up quick and other people besides me can help if you post it publicly. \n2. Not following the rest of this guide will mean I will ignore the post. &quot;KMS failed please help&quot; does not give me enough info.\n3. Be absolutely 100% positive no AV/Firewall/Security are interfering. There are few reasons KMS fails and this is the main one. Do not assume things are OK because no alert occurred, make sure things are excluded.\nSteps:\n1. For whatever the problem is, if applicable, copy a full amount of the output/log. EX; If AutoKMS is failing get the AutoKMS.log contents, if another function is failing get all of the output sent to the Information Console.\n2. Get the output of Check Activation Status\n3. Post the output gathered in Step 2. If it is large, dump it to pastebin.org or a similar site and post the link to that dump in Microsoft Toolkit thread and explain that you had problems. You may have to obfuscate it (hxxp:// instead of http://) if your post count is too low to post links.\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nNOTES:\n\nMicrosoft Toolkit 2.4.3.exe has been tested in a virtual \nenvironment and will activate both of these Windows 8 OS's:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8382078/Microsoft_Windows_8.1_Build_9369_(x64)-P2P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8382078/Microsoft_Windows_8.1_Build_9369_(x64)-P2P&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Win 8.1 Build 9369 (x64)] - Released April 17, 2013 --- Thank You, Gh0stNet VIP\n\n\nAND\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7799245/Windows_8_Professional_RETAIL_%5B32bit_64bit%5D_w__3_Activators_%5BWOR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7799245/Windows_8_Professional_RETAIL_%5B32bit_64bit%5D_w__3_Activators_%5BWOR&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Windows 8 Pro AIO Build 9200] - Released November 6, 2012 --- Thank You, CoryTheGreat\n\n\nVM Used: --- VMwareÃ‚Â® Workstation ------ 9.0.2 build-1031769 \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8234229/VMware.Workstation.v9.0.2.1031769.Incl.Keymaker-ZWT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8234229/VMware.Workstation.v9.0.2.1031769.Incl.Keymaker-ZWT&lt;/a&gt; --- Thank You, scene4all VIP\n\n\nOn a Windows 7 Ultimate [ALC] 64-bit Host OS Computer:\n\nWindows 7 Ultimate x64 [ALC]  links: --- Thank You, AUDIA4\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://1337x.org/torrent/315231/Windows7-SP1-Ultimate-64bit-Alchemist-2012-ACTIVATED/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://1337x.org/torrent/315231/Windows7-SP1-Ultimate-64bit-Alchemist-2012-ACTIVATED/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7103866/Windows7_SP1_Ultimate_64bit_Alchemist_2012_ACTIVATED&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7103866/Windows7_SP1_Ultimate_64bit_Alchemist_2012_ACTIVATED&lt;/a&gt;\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n\nMicrosoft Toolkit 2.4.3 tested with and activates:\n\n\nOffice 2013 Pro Plus VL 64-bit\n\n(File: Office.Pro.Plus.2013.x64.EN.X18-55297.ISO) --- Thank You, WDoubleYouW\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8247858/Office.2013.Pro.Plus.VL.with.Microsoft.Toolkit.2.4.1.Activator&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8247858/Office.2013.Pro.Plus.VL.with.Microsoft.Toolkit.2.4.1.Activator&lt;/a&gt;\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Seed the FUCK out of this...
