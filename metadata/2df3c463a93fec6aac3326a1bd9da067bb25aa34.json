You won&amp;#039;t be disappointed!!! *****\n\nYes, these files will install the main Rosetta Stone application, crack the activation, \nand install Spanish (Spain) Language Packs 1, 2, and 3.\n\n-Do you know how to work with .iso&amp;#039;s?\n\n-Do you know what a virtual drive is?\n\n-Do you know how to mount and unmount?\n\nIf you answered NO to any of those questions, I&amp;#039;ll assume you need to get some additional software.\n\nHere is a link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm?=mdisc_hlp93&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm?=mdisc_hlp93&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIts freeware and safe; I&amp;#039;ve used it for a long time.

It will also error when you close the program; usually an instruction error.\n\n***ADD LANGUAGE PACK***\nSo I&amp;#039;ve included Spanish (Spain) 1, 2, &amp; 3\nLets install Spanish 1\n\nJust as you mounted the iso to install, you need to mount the language iso.\nFollow the mounting instructions above. (as you should have unmounted already)\nMount file: Spain 1 .iso\n\nGo back to Rosetta Stone program (open again if you closed it)\nYou should easily see the link to add a language.\nJust follow the steps and it will read the language pack on your virtual drive.\nInstall and enjoy!!!\n\nYou should not get any errors or activation messages anymore.\n\nThanks\nOneBadUnit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2df3c463a93fec6aac3326a1bd9da067bb25aa34","amp;dn":"Rosetta+Stone+Application+Install+%2B+Spanish+%28Spain%29+1%2C+2%2C+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2df3c463a93fec6aac3326a1bd9da067bb25aa34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,243,196,99,169,63,236,106,172,51,38,161,189,157,160,103,187,37,170,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
