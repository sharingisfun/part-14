The first disc features a great performance from a 1970 show at the Royal Albert Hall. The second disc shows the band's evolution throughout the decade that they dominated. Of particular interest is the chapter featuring the 1973 Madison Square Garden show that was filmed for The Song Remains the Same featuring outtake performances including wonderful versions of their classics &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; and &quot;The Ocean&quot;. Also, you get to see several songs from what would be their final British concert at the 1979 Knebworth Festival. However, the whole two disc set is a treat for all Zeppelin fans. \n\nDVD #1: \nLive at the Royal Albert Hall-1970 \nWe're Gonna Groove \nI Can't Quit you Baby \nDazed and Confused \nWhite Summer \nWhat is and What Should Never Be \nHow Many More Times \nMoby Dick \nWhole Lotta Love \nCommunication Breakdown \nC'mon Everybody \nSomething Else \nBring it on Home \n\nDVD#2: \nImmigrant Song Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1972 \nMADISON SQUARE GARDEN- 1973 \nBlack Dog \nMisty Mountain Hop \nSince I've been Loving You \nThe Ocean \nEARLS COURT- 1975 \nGoing to California \nThat's the Way \nBron Yr Aur Stomp \nIn my Time of Dying \nTrampled Under Foot \nStairway to Heaven \nKNEBWORTH- 1979 \nRock and Roll \nNobody's Fault but Mine \nSick Again \nAchilles Last Stand \nIn the Evening \nKashmir \nWhole Lotta Love \n\nLED ZEPPELIN: \nRobert Plant- Vocals and Harmonica \nJimmy Page- Electric and Acoustic Guitars \nJohn Paul Jones- Bass Guitar, Keyboards and Mandolin \nJohn Bonham- Drums and Percussion \n\nINFO: \nVideo- \nResolution- NTSC 720x480 \nCompression- MPEG-2 \nFrame Rate- 29.97fps \nDisplay- 4:3 \nPixel Shape- 10:11(NTSC 4:3) \nAverage Bitrate- 4.82Mbps \nVideo Structure- Progressive \n\nAudio- \nFormat- Stereo, 48000Hz, 80Kbps \n\nDuration: \nDisc#1- 01:42.13 \nDisc#2- 02:05.45 \nSize: 2.10GB \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b40f37ccfb8c9ceafe2024d5c8a38d60605a03b","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+2dvd+Set+Live%28dvdripmp4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b40f37ccfb8c9ceafe2024d5c8a38d60605a03b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,64,243,124,207,184,201,206,175,226,2,77,92,138,56,214,6,5,160,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
