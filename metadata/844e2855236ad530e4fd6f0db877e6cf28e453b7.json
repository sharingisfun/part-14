Her mother, the beautiful Alia, taught her daughter the skills she needed to survive. A plastic smile. Saying yes. Burying in boxes in her mind the horrors she glimpsed around her. &quot;Learn to erase your memories,&quot; she instructed. \n\n&quot;He can read eyes.&quot; In this richly visual memoir, Salbi describes tyranny as she saw it - through the eyes of a privileged child, a rebellious teenager, a violated wife, and ultimately a public figure fighting to overcome the skill that once kept her alive: silence. Between Two Worlds is a riveting quest for truth that deepens our understanding of the universal themes of power, fear, sexual subjugation, and the question one generation asks the one before it: How could you have let this happen to us?\n\nGenre: Autobiography, Politics, History, Iraq","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:844e2855236ad530e4fd6f0db877e6cf28e453b7","amp;dn":"Between+Two+Worlds+by+Zainab+Salbi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"844e2855236ad530e4fd6f0db877e6cf28e453b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,78,40,85,35,106,213,48,228,253,111,13,184,119,230,207,40,228,83,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
