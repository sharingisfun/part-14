Beside asian and russian airlines also from Frankfurt fly german Condor and the switzerland airline EdelweiÃƒÅ¸ from ZRH in the month may to september to Anchorage.\n\n\nI haven't FS9 installed now, so I can't check it, but it's look like it should work.\n\n1. Go to C:Documents and SettingsUsernameLocal SettingsTemp and scroll all the way down\n2. Start the Anchorage installer\n3. Select a language\n4. Go back to the Temp folder. Two new folders will have been created. Open the bottom one.\n5. Inside this folder there is another folder; copy the .dll from the crack folder to that first folder and overwrite.\n6. Now proceed with installation; fill in anything or nothing when you get to the registration screen.\n\nIt's readme text, but there is no point on what to do whith .rar BGL files. I think need to copy ot and overwrite whith the original as usual.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74abfe8684b3b60cb4ad29a1c9e48c2fd580afce","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Aerosoft+-+Anchorage+%28Scene%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74abfe8684b3b60cb4ad29a1c9e48c2fd580afce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,171,254,134,132,179,182,12,180,173,41,161,201,228,140,47,213,128,175,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
