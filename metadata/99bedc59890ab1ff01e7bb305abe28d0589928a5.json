Had three weeks extra and still it looked like I could not find enough quality (honesty &amp; care) songs to make some playlists. So I had to combine things and consequently, some lists may appear a bit mixed (up) (Fragments). In the end, all went well and could smoothen up some ruff edges. The result is 274 tracks (out of all the net has to offer). Songs I would like to play for friends (and you might like)..... Which I find best? Get Lucky and Deprived do have something extra. But having said that, all lists have turned out quite good..... So enjoy and share, I hope.\n\nPS Type of Playlist: I1=Lounge/Folk/Pop, I2=Pop/Rock, I3=Electro Rock, I4=Solid Rock, I5=Garage Rock\n\n\n~@~ Indie 1308\n\nI1 Just Enough\n\n 01 Soft Machine - A Certain Kind.\n 02 The Pastels - Slow Summits.\n 03 Mazzy Star - California.\n 04 Islands - Wave Forms.\n 05 Alex Turner - It's Hard To Get Around The Wind.\n 06 The Joy Formidable - Silent Treatment.\n 07 The Mini Skips - EvilShy (A).\n 08 Laura Mvula - Green Garden.\n 09 The Melodic - On My Way.\n 10 Eisley - Wicked Child.\n 11 New Buffalo - Recovery.\n 12 Beck - I Won't Be Long.\n 13 Fanfarlo - Myth Of Myself (A Ruse To Exploit Our Weaknesses).\n 14 Alela Diane - Lost Land.\n 15 The Melodic - On My Way.\n 16 Supergrass - Late In The Day.\n 17 Embrace - My Weakness Is None Of Your Business.\n 18 The Left - Better Off This Way.\n 19 Manic Street Preachers - Theme From M.A.S.H (Suicide Is Painless).\n 20 Longpigs - On And On.\n 21 Greyjoy - Strangers.\n 22 Space - Neighbourhood.\n 23 The Divine Comedy - Becoming More Like Alfie.\n 24 Fun Lovin' Criminals - King Of New York.\n 25 Eels - Your Lucky Day In Hell.\n 26 Kidsmoke - Take Me To The River.\n 27 Y Luv - Just Enough.\n 28 Hearts - All The Days.\n 29 Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know.\n 30 Ducktails - Under Cover.\n\nI2 Fragments\n\n 001 Lowing - I'll Wait For You.\n 002 Autoheart - Moscow.\n 003 James - Come Home (Flood Mix).\n 004 Helena Noguerra - The End Of The Story.\n 005 The Title Sequence - Lovers.\n 006 James - Laid.\n 007 Ash - Girl From Mars.\n 008 Jaymesyoung - Fragments.\n 009 Goldfrapp - Drew.\n 010 French For Rabbits - Goat.\n 011 Shed Seven - Chasing Rainbows.\n 012 Wolf In A Spacesuit - Sea-Of-Love.\n 013 Dawn &amp; Marra - Wicked Little Girl.\n 014 Glasvegas - I'd Rather Be Dead Than Be With You.\n 015 Pacific Air - Duet In B Minor.\n 016 Dent May &amp; His Magnificent Ukulele - Born Too Late.\n 017 Mother Falcon - Dream Of Water.\n 018 Daylighting - Rivers Of The Living Dead.\n 019 London Grammar - Strong.\n 020 Southern - Where The Wild Are.\n 021 Calexico - Maybe On Monday.\n 022 Portugal.
