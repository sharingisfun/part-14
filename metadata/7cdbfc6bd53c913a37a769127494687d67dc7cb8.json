The first reggae band to win a Grammy award, for their 1983 album Anthem, \nBlack Uhuru was, according to Reggae: The Rough Guide, &quot;The most dynamic and progressive reggae act of the 1970s and early '80s.&quot; \n\n\nReleased the same year as their Grammy-winning Anthem album, Black Uhuru's The Dub Factor figures as one of the most impressive of reggae's electronic age dub releases. Bristling from the fine mixing work of Soljie and Maxie, the album is basically a reworking of the band's breakthrough Chill Out release from the\nyear before, albeit in often unrecognizable form. But if you like your dub with a healthy dose of apocalyptic effects from syndrums, synthesizers, and mixing board alike, then The Dub Factor will do the trick. More than just a empty exercise in knob twiddling, this Black Uhuru dub excursion by Sly &amp; Robbie will no doubt please both fans of the group and habituates of quality dub titles.\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. Ion storm\n2. Youth\n3. Big Spliff\n4. Boof N'Baff N' Biff\n5. Puffed Out\n6. Android Rebellion\n7. Apocalypse\n8. Back Breaker\n9.
