The game features a gradual learning of fundamental algebraic elements (equal sign, zero, multiplication, division, parenthesis, negative numbers, fractions, ...).\n\nThe player learns at his/her own pace, experimenting with rules that are introduced step by step. Progress is illustrated with the birth and growth of a dragon for each new chapter.\n\nThis game primarily targets children from 6 to 16 who are willing to discover algebra or to consolidate past learning and gains. Playing doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t require supervision, although parents can help making the learning more efficient and transferring learned skills in real life. \n\nIt is a great game for parents to play along with their kids Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and freshen up their own math skills.\nDragonBox is based on an original concept developed in Norway, introducing a novel pedagogical method based on discovery and experimentation. The game greatly helps children to make it up with math, and contributes to sharpen their desire to learn and to be successful with math.\n\nThis game is the subject of extensive research at the Center for Game Science of the University of Washington.\nDragonBox has received many distinctions, and among others, the Gold Medal of the 2012 Serious Play Award (USA) and the Best Serious Game at the 2013 IMGA Awards. It is recommended by Common Sense Media.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* 10 progressive chapters (5 learning, 5 training)\n* 200 puzzles\n* Suggested (and not put forward) rules the child can experiment with\n* Multiple profiles for easy progress control\n* Dedicated graphics and music for each chapter\n* 16 supported languages (English, franÃƒÂ§ais, norsk, svenska, dansk, espaÃƒÂ±ol, Ã­â€¢Å“ÃªÂµÂ­Ã¬â€“Â´, italiano, portuguÃƒÂªs, Deutsch, Ã‘â‚¬Ã‘Æ’Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂºÃÂ¸ÃÂ¹, Ã§Â®â‚¬Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¦â€“â€¡, Ã§Â¹ï¿½Ã©Â«â€Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦â€“â€¡, suomi, nederlands, euskara)\n\nWhat's New:\n\nBug fixes\n* New text translations: Dutch, Basque\n* Fix bugs that could let the game in unplayable state\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wewanttoknow.DragonBoxPlus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wewanttoknow.DragonBoxPlus&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa1b5ee30c5e74c9fc256f3c4620ad5721bd867d","amp;dn":"DragonBox+Algebra+5%2B+v1.1.6+%5BPD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa1b5ee30c5e74c9fc256f3c4620ad5721bd867d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,27,94,227,12,94,116,201,252,37,111,60,70,32,173,87,33,189,134,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
