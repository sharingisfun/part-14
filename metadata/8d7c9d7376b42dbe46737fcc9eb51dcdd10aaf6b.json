A delicate piano floats over the track, bringing it to life in an elegant way while the kicks drive the track's energy higher.\nIan Pooley reduced the track to its essentials and build from there, creating a deep vibe in which the pads rise to reveal a frantic energy that flows gently throughout.\n'Rascals' is a lighter track with the focus on rhythmic synth rather than heavy kicks or bass. The pads rise and fall putting the playful lead into the light.\nAnd finally, Fabio Giannelli twists a dark tale from 'Rascals' with what has become his signature sound. Heavy kicks, epic bass and dark vibes is what it's all about here, and he does it all in good taste and fantastic style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d7c9d7376b42dbe46737fcc9eb51dcdd10aaf6b","amp;dn":"Wankelmut+-+Wood+%26amp%3B+Wine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d7c9d7376b42dbe46737fcc9eb51dcdd10aaf6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,124,157,115,118,180,45,190,70,115,127,204,158,181,29,205,209,10,175,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
