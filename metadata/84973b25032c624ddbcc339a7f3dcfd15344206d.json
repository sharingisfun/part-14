Yes, we mean the FACERIG install script.  â–‘\r\n â–‘  Yes, we know the commands are also in the .vdf. You still ripped it off  â–‘\r\n â–‘  from our installer. When we tried to discuss the matter in private you   â–‘\r\n â–‘  first denied, then you got defensive, implying that it was a petty thing â–‘\r\n â–‘  to notice. Guess what? So is ripping off the script, assholes. And it's  â–‘\r\n â–‘  not the first time either. The only other NEWiSO release we checked had  â–‘\r\n â–‘  ripped off the license from one of our previous cracks. We're not going  â–‘\r\n â–‘  to check other of your shit, since we don't need or use any of your      â–‘\r\n â–‘  releases. Guess that's why you expect to get away with it. Like a lot of â–‘\r\n â–‘  new groups pretending to be &quot;scene&quot;, your main concern is convincing yourâ–‘\r\n â–‘  lamer sycophant ops and autotraders. Existing groups are probably seen asâ–‘\r\n â–‘  an inconvenience because they can call you out on your bullshit. But it  â–‘\r\n â–‘  doesn't matter. Instead of sharing or racing with competing groups you   â–‘\r\n â–‘  will rip them off, deny, get caught, deny some more, and then what? Wait â–‘\r\n â–‘  for everybody to die off so you'll be the only ones left? Left of what?  â–‘\r\n â–‘  Anyhoo, we're calling you out. Go choke on a pretzel.
