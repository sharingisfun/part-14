In Dataclysm, Christian Rudder uses it to show us who we truly are. \n \nFor centuries, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve relied on polling or small-scale lab experiments to study human behavior. Today, a new approach is possible. As we live more of our lives online, researchers can finally observe us directly, in vast numbers, and without filters. Data scientists have become the new demographers.\n \nIn this daring and original book, Rudder explains how Facebook &quot;likes&quot; can predict, with surprising accuracy, a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexual orientation and even intelligence; how attractive women receive exponentially more interview requests; and why you must have haters to be hot. He charts the rise and fall of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most reviled word through Google Search and examines the new dynamics of collaborative rage on Twitter. He shows how people express themselves, both privately and publicly. What is the least Asian thing you can say? Do people bathe more in Vermont or New Jersey? What do black women think about Simon &amp; Garfunkel? (Hint: they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think about Simon &amp; Garfunkel.) Rudder also traces human migration over time, showing how groups of people move from certain small towns to the same big cities across the globe. And he grapples with the challenge of maintaining privacy in a world where these explorations are possible.\n \nVisually arresting and full of wit and insight, Dataclysm is a new way of seeing ourselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€a brilliant alchemy, in which math is made human and numbers become the narrative of our time.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One's Looking) by Christian Rudder. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dataclysm.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dataclysm.org/&lt;/a&gt; Please buy the book if it is available in your area.\nThe Ebook version is only $7 and the hardcover is $16, great for convincing\npeople to have sex with you or just whatever you want to do with it.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84fb291dda73be1ddeff37dc5f224723086f060c","amp;dn":"Dataclysm%3A+Who+We+Are+%28When+We+Think+No+One%27s+Looking%29+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84fb291dda73be1ddeff37dc5f224723086f060c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,251,41,29,218,115,190,29,222,255,55,220,95,34,71,35,8,111,6,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
