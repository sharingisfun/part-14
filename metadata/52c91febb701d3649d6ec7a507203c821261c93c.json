In his cynical manner, he merely records his incredible encounters with seemingly all the renegades and twised characters of a scorched Europe and willing or not he witnesses the atrophies and deformities of human mind. Ironically, the author somehow manages to turn his characters into hillarious and amiable, even entertaining figures.\nCeline writes like no other writer you have read. His truncated sentences, in bits and pieces all over the place, remind of a rather maniac mind spinning thoughts at the speed of light in an incohomprensive, bordering to delirious babble. That's Celine all right throughout North. In poignant remarks, making fun, laughing at himself, expressing same anxiety, bitternes, and cynical observations as in his other writings, Celine moves on, weary but undefeated. Life goes on. \n- Walter Nicolau","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52c91febb701d3649d6ec7a507203c821261c93c","amp;dn":"Louis-Ferdinand+Celine+-+1960+-+North+%28422p%29+%5BInua%5D.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52c91febb701d3649d6ec7a507203c821261c93c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,201,31,235,183,1,211,100,157,110,199,165,7,32,60,130,18,97,201,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
