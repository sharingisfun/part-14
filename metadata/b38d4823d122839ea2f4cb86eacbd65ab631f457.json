But Dom Marcus Cavendish will be satisfied with nothing less than collaring the fiercely independent Julia.\n\nNothing could have shocked her moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nJulia Lyle is invited to her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wedding and is stunned when Lana kneels to accept her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collar. When Julia starts to object, firm, relentless hands land on her shoulders. The man behind her threatens to turn her over his knee if she interrupts. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outraged, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no doubt heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serious.\n\nAfter the ceremony, he offers her a glimpse into her friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifestyle, if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brave enough to accept.\n\nMaster Marcus Cavendish is everything she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want in a manÃ¢â‚¬â€dominant, self-assured and arrogant. So why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t she resist him?\n\nTelling herself that learning about the lifestyle will make her a better friend, Julia agrees to submit to Master Marcus, but only for the evening. Firm and unrelenting in his handling of her, he introduces her to his tawse and the pleasure/pain of a spanking delivered by a competent Dom. The experience unnerves her, making her question everything she thought she knew about relationships, and his forced orgasms leave her shattered.\n\nNo doubt the scene seduced her, and that makes her doubly determined to avoid him. She has fought hard for her freedom and vowed only to date nice men, and Master Marcus is anything but safe.\n\nMarcus is undeterred. Julia is a natural sub. The way she responded to his touch, his voice, his punishment proved it. Now he has to convince her to yield to him, submitting to his tawse as she kneels to accept his collar.\n\nBook 2: On His Terms (Mastered #2) by Sierra Cartwright (April 22nd 2013) \n\nBook two in the Mastered Series.\n\nIt was business onlyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Chelsea Barton is terrible at the whole submission thing, and she wants to snare the Dom of her dreams. She seeks out the renowned trainer Master Alexander. Alex has his hands full with Chelsea, especially when he realises he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to turn her over to another manÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nDamn, damn, and double damn. This was so not supposed to happen.\n\nChelsea Barton always gets what she wants, and she wants the up and coming rocker Evan C to accept her as his sub. But her performance always disappoints him.\n\nDetermined to have her way, she begs Master Alexander Monahan to train her.\n\nAlex has given up training submissives, and no matter what, he would not work with someone as bold, headstrong, and stubborn as Chelsea.\n\nBut thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something about her that intrigues and impresses him, an enthusiasm that is missing from his too-dull life. Under very strict guidelines he agrees. She has to try her best. She has to submit uncomplainingly to his punishments. And thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a two week obligation, after which they will part ways. Being a trainer is a very different relationship than a D/s, and despite his intentions to remain aloof, he starts to care deeply for the headstrong Chelsea.\n\nChelsea unhesitatingly agrees to Master AlexanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rules, after all, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to give her the skills she needs to get what she wants. But, damn it, the longer she trains with him, the more she is attracted to his rugged good look as well as to his firm, but relentless ways. She reminds herself of her goals, but that becomes more difficult every day.\n\nFor Alex, falling for a sub who will belong to another man was never part of the deal.\n\nReader Advisory: This book contains scenes of anal sex.\n\nReader Advisory: This book can be read as a standalone, but is also part of the Mastered series.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38d4823d122839ea2f4cb86eacbd65ab631f457","amp;dn":"Mastered+Series+%281-2%29+by+Sierra+Cartwright+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b38d4823d122839ea2f4cb86eacbd65ab631f457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,141,72,35,209,34,131,158,162,244,203,134,234,203,214,90,182,49,244,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
