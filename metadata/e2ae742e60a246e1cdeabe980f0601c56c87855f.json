If you are one of the world's more than 200 million expatriatesÃ¢â‚¬â€or thinking of joining their ranksÃ¢â‚¬â€The Global Expatriate's Guide to Investing is a hands-on and entertaining guide to making the most of your hard-earned money. If you are like many expats who don't have a pension or another reliable financial safety net, don't despair! This handbook arms you with the tools, tactics, and advice to live better, earn more, and provide for a generous retirement.\n\nWritten by bestselling author Andrew Hallam, this easy-to-understand guide shows expatriates how much they should be saving; how much they need for retirement; and how to find a reputable financial advisor or how to invest their money on their own. Hallam offers a sensible, actionable game plan that lays out how to set up and manage an effective portfolio of investments, no matter what your country of origin. The Global Expatriate's Guide to Investing is filled with simple investment methods that work. The text's illustrative examples include information on cap-weighted indexing, fundamental indexing, and creating a &quot;Permanent Portfolio&quot; which mixes differing asset classes.\n\nWith The Global Expatriate's Guide to Investing as your trusted aide, you won't fall prey to unethical financial advisors whose outsized commissions line their pockets with your gold. Best of all, Hallam shows how to spend just 90 minutes a year on your investments, while thumping the performance of most professional money managers.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nPraise for THE GLOBAL EXPATRIATE'S GUIDE TO INVESTING\n\n&quot;In a world full of finance books it is a pleasure to find one that (a) does not pull its punches and (b) is written with a sense of humor. Take it on your next long-haul flight. It is full of fascinating facts and gives unambiguous advice. The considerable knowledge and passion of the author makes this an easy read. The advice is clear and is supported with evidence. The book is written with expatriates in mind, but there is wisdom here that applies to all. I recommend this bookÃ¢â‚¬â€it has clear advice and will make you smile.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Ben Sherwood, Principal, Hillier Hopkins LLP, Chartered Accountants and Tax Advisors, UK; author, The 7 Secrets of Money\n\n&quot;Expatriates everywhere should thank Andrew Hallam for his clear, smart, and entertaining guide to financial freedom. His book is aimed at a growing and often overlooked groupÃ¢â‚¬â€people who are working outside of their home countries, often drawing big paychecks, but baffled by a maze of unfamiliar investing options. If that's you, look no further for sound advice on how to see through the sales pitches and construct your own path to affluence.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Ian McGugan, The Globe and Mail, Toronto\n\n&quot;I have purchased a copy of this book for every member of my staff. It should be mandatory reading for any expatriate corporate or educational wellness program!&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€James Dalziel, Ed.D, Head of East Campus, United World College of South East Asia\n\n&quot;Andrew Hallam has hit another home run with his second book, The Global Expatriate's Guide to Investing. His research is impressive and is made all the more believable by stories of the good and bad choices of real people. Peppered with common sense and plenty of humor, the Guide is a must read for expatriates looking to do the right thing regarding their retirement funds. Andrew Hallam shows us the money.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Paul Chmelik, Director, The American Embassy School, New Delhi, India\n\n&quot;Andrew Hallam has filled a void for all those navigating the treacherous waters of expatriate saving and investing. This should be the first book read by the Aussie exec in Hong Kong, the British teacher in Saudi Arabia, or the French engineer in Malaysia. Witty, readable, and profitable; don't leave home without it!&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€William Bernstein, author, The Four Pillars of Investing and A Splendid Exchange","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2ae742e60a246e1cdeabe980f0601c56c87855f","amp;dn":"The+Global+Expatriate%27s+Guide+to+Investing+-+Andrew+Hallam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2ae742e60a246e1cdeabe980f0601c56c87855f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,174,116,46,96,162,70,225,205,234,190,152,15,6,1,197,108,135,133,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
