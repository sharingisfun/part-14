This spellbinding \ntale describes the Martian invasion of earth. Following the landing in England of \nten huge and indefatigable creatures, complete chaos erupts. Using their fiery heat \nrays and monstrous strength, the heartless aliens threaten the future existence of \nall life on earth. \n\nThis classic chiller, when adapted for radio in 1938 by Orson Welles, was realistic \nenough to cause widespread panic throughout the United States. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7950e8cbbbb1e46be8c007a2291ba5d142c20875","amp;dn":"The+War+of+the+Worlds+-+by+H.G.+Wells+%285+CDs+unabr+128+kB%2Fs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7950e8cbbbb1e46be8c007a2291ba5d142c20875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,80,232,203,187,177,228,107,232,192,7,162,41,27,165,209,66,194,8,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
