There may be no fighting in this film but it's all about war.\n\nTaken from British TV. In German/English/French with hardcoded English subtitles (not on the English sections). Not a perfect copy but superior to any of the rubbish DVD releases I've seen (some have been over-dubbed into Italian).\n\n\nThis has been re-uploaded as some people had audio problems with the AVI. Maybe best to leave this as a DVD or the problem may return.\n\nPlease continue to seed once you grab this.\n\nSearch term: http://thepiratebay.se/search/freakyflicks/0/3/200\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8499d5318aa6be913049485e8a35e8589d6be434","amp;dn":"Germany+Year+Zero+%28Roberto+Rossellini%29+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8499d5318aa6be913049485e8a35e8589d6be434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,153,213,49,138,166,190,145,48,73,72,94,138,53,232,88,157,107,228,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
