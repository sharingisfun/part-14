He was Napoleon, one of the most brilliant and complex figures in history. This absorbing appraisal of his life offers a new perspective of the little man from Corsica, who rose to new heights of power by seizing every brutal, outrageous opportunity in his path. \nIn 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte, a native of Corsica, crowned himself emperor of France, an audacious gesture that illustrated his overweening pride and ruthless ambition. Despite his diminutive stature, &quot;the little corporal&quot; loomed large over much of Europe for two decades-as an adroit statesman, military strategist and ruthless conqueror. This sweeping documentary reveals the private tribulations as well as the public triumphs of a complex historical legend. From the glory of his empire to his defeat at Waterloo and miserable exile on Elba, here is an entertaining and complete portrait of an extraordinary life.\n\nNarrated by Robert Whelan\nExecutive Producers : Bob Carruthers ; Gary Russell\nProducers : Gavin Bott ; Audrey Healy\nDirected and Edited by Chris Gormlie\nCromwell Productions 2001\n\n\n\n1)  The Early Years \nFrom his birth in the Corsican capital of Ajaccio in August 1769, Napoleon Bonaparte seems to have been earmarked for greatness. There was little during his early years to suggest as much however, for he came from an ordinary if well-to-do family and had a difficult schooling in France. But joining the military was the making of him and he soon discovered a remarkable gift for impressing influential people. This episode covers the all-important early years of Napoleon's life up to his capture of Toulon in 1793 and the infamous 'whiff of grapeshot', when he fired upon and killed over 200 rebellious French citizens to protect the Government.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2056 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x536\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.313:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 47:51.600\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 795 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83a3ef0a14738da49845455d4bee22e0295208fa","amp;dn":"HC+Napoleon+The+Man+The+Myth+The+Legend+1of6+The+Early+Years+Xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83a3ef0a14738da49845455d4bee22e0295208fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,163,239,10,20,115,141,164,152,69,69,93,75,238,34,224,41,82,8,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
