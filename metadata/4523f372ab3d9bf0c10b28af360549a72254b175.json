But nestled among the concrete is an urban wilderness - places where crocodiles, monkeys, otters, snakes and hornbills sit right among the skyscrapers and boardwalks. This is Singapore: Wild City. Filmed over the course of a year and divided into two 1-hour episodes narrated by natural history legend Sir David Attenborough, the series aims to be nothing less than a comprehensive profile of Singapore's surprisingly diverse animals and plants and their fascinating behaviors. The two acts to the series showcase the range of different habitats found in and around the built up urban sprawl, then journey around the island's hidden wildlife hotspots - from the overlooked interior to the inaccessible coastline and islands that have become unplanned sanctuaries for Singapore's natural heritage. By the end of the show, viewers will have an eye-opening experience and a deeper appreciation for the amazing life forms that live right next door.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Urban Wild \r\nThe first part, Urban Wild, will look at the built-up surroundings - from the city centre to the suburban areas - where various animals and plants have adopted as their home, as Singapore's landscape rapidly changes. It uncovers several hidden gems, from troops of macaques that straddle forest and condominium-life, civets that take up residencies in roof cavities, reticulated pythons that hunt for their prey in the drains and the world's first family of wild otters breeding right in the heart of the city in Marina Bay.\r\n\r\n2)  Hidden Wild \r\nHidden Wild, the second part of the series, takes a peek at overlooked, tucked-away areas of the island that are now home to an astonishing variety of creatures. These areas include the coastal wetlands, abandoned buildings and offshore islands, which animals such as colugos (gliding mammals also known as flying lemurs - although they aren't true lemurs), fiddler crabs and Singapore's oldest predators - the crocodiles.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/87/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f4/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e0/Singapore-Wild-City-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3166 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.beachhousepictures.com/wild-city/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4523f372ab3d9bf0c10b28af360549a72254b175","amp;dn":"BSkyB+Singapore+Wild+City+Series+1+2of2+Hidden+Wild+720p+x264+AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4523f372ab3d9bf0c10b28af360549a72254b175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,35,243,114,171,61,155,240,193,11,40,175,54,5,73,167,34,84,177,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
