HeÃ‚â€™s always had his pick of any girl in townÃ‚â€”and on the competition circuit. But underneath his cool exterior is a young man in turmoil, trying to take the edge off tragedy by overindulging in sex and shredding the slopes. In fact, ZÃ‚â€™s reckless behavior is a thinly veiled attempt to blunt his emotional suffering with physical pain.\n\n Ophelia Richardson isnÃ‚â€™t like any girl Z has ever met. Though sheÃ‚â€™s from New Orleans high society, sheÃ‚â€™s no Southern belleÃ‚â€”and sheÃ‚â€™s not shy about being miserable in frozen, godforsaken Park City. But laying low is her only option after her ex, a rich boy who couldnÃ‚â€™t take no for an answer, nearly killed her in a jealous rage. Following that terrifying encounter, the last thing Ophelia needs is a boyfriendÃ‚â€”especially one as rich and arrogant as Z. But Ophelia soon discovers that he isnÃ‚â€™t what he seems. If anything, Z may be even more damaged than she is.\n\n Tormented by their pasts and feeling alone in the world, Z and Ophelia find a connection unlike any theyÃ‚â€™ve ever known. But with Ophelia hiding the details of her life in Louisiana and ZÃ‚â€™s death wish reaching terrifying new heights, their relationship seems to be going downhill before it even beginsÃ‚â€”unless they can find the strength in each other to trust, grow, and love again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7ccb493a61de6b0144ebdd7353e9b4499a96173","amp;dn":"Shredded+%28Extreme+Risk+%231%29+by+Tracy+Wolff.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7ccb493a61de6b0144ebdd7353e9b4499a96173","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,204,180,147,166,29,230,176,20,78,189,215,53,62,155,68,153,169,97,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
