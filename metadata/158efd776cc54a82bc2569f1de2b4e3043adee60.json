They introduced DPEA, the Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy, a program designed to teach twenty-first-century skills via project-based learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). They discovered that when they added &quot;art&quot; to the program (STEAM) they attracted 50% more girls, and got better adoption from parents, mentors, the outside community, and students. DPEA allows students to explore one project a year, rotating through each aspect of the STEAM program. The Academy has been running for over ten years and is recognized as a pioneer in education reform, prizing independent thought and modern skills over standardized testing and book-based lectures. Here the students, teachers, and administrators tell us why it works. Learn about their cutting-edge robotics program, multidisciplinary approach, and the unique collaborations that happen between students, teachers, and parents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:158efd776cc54a82bc2569f1de2b4e3043adee60","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Project-Based+Learning%3A+STEM+to+STEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"158efd776cc54a82bc2569f1de2b4e3043adee60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,142,253,119,108,197,74,130,188,37,105,241,222,43,78,48,67,173,238,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
