In\n1920s Berlin, she acted on the stage and in silent films. Her performance as Lola-Lola in The\nBlue Angel, directed by Josef von Sternberg, brought her international fame and a contract\nwith Paramount Pictures in the USA. Hollywood films such as Shanghai Express and Desire\ncapitalised on her glamour and exoticism, cementing her stardom and making her one of the\nhighest paid actresses of the era. Dietrich became a US citizen in 1939; during World War II,\nshe was a high-profile frontline entertainer. Although she still made occasional films in the\npost-war years, Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a\nsuccessful show performer.\n\nIn 1999 the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth greatest female star of all time.\n\nIn 1921, Dietrich auditioned unsuccessfully for theatrical director and impressario Max\nReinhardt's drama academy; however, she soon found herself working in his theatres as a\nchorus girl and playing small roles in dramas, without attracting any special attention at first.\n\nDietrich made her film debut playing a bit part in the 1922 film, So sind die MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nner. She met\nher future husband, Rudolf Sieber, on the set of another film made that year, TragÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶die der\nLiebe. In the G. W. Pabst film, Die freudlose Gasse (1925), the actress playing Elsa is Hertha\nvon Walther (1903-1987), who looks very much like the young Marlene Dietrich, giving rise to\nthe false rumor that Dietrich has a bit part in this film.\n\nDietrich and Sieber were married on 17 May 1924. Her only child, daughter Maria Elisabeth\nSieber, later billed as actress Maria Riva, was born on 13 December 1924.\n\nDietrich continued to work on stage and in film both in Berlin and Vienna throughout the\n1920s. On stage, she had roles of varying importance in Frank Wedekind's Pandora's Box,\nWilliam Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew and A Midsummer Night's Dream as well as\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's Back to Methuselah and Misalliance. It was in musicals and revues,\nsuch as Broadway, Es Liegt in der Luft and Zwei Krawatten, however, that she attracted the\nmost attention.\n\nBy the late 1920s, Dietrich was also playing sizable parts on screen - the most notable films\nbeing CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Electric (1927), Ich kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sse Ihre Hand, Madame (1928) and Das Schiff der\nverlorenen Menschen (1929).\n\nIn 1929, Dietrich landed the breakthrough role of Lola-Lola, a cabaret singer who causes the\ndownfall of a hitherto respected schoolmaster, in UFA's production, The Blue Angel (1930).\nThe film was directed by Josef von Sternberg, who thereafter took credit for having\n&quot;discovered&quot; Dietrich. The film is also noteworthy for having introduced Dietrich's signature\nsong &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n  December 27, 1901\n\n      Birth of Marie Magdalene Dietrich in Berlin-Schoneberg.\n      Parents: Louis Erich Otto Dietrich and Elisabeth Josephine nee Felsing.\n\n   1907 - 1919\n\n      School in Berlin and Dessau.\n\n   1922\n\n      First stage roles in Berlin theatres, including the Grosses Schauspielhaus Berlin \n      (director Max Reinhardt); first small parts in films.\n\n   May 17, 1923\n\n      Marriage to Rudolf Sieber (1897 - 1976).\n\n   December 13, 1924\n\n      Birth of daughter Maria Elizabeth Sieber.\n\n   1929\n\n      First leading part in the film DIE FRAU, NACH DER MAN SICH SEHNT.\n\n   October 1929\n\n      Screen tests and contract for the film DER BLAUE ENGEL.\n\n   April 1, 1930\n\n      Premiere of the DER BLAUE ENGEL at the Gloria Palast in Berlin.\n\n   April 2, 1930\n\n      Departure for America.\n\n   November 14, 1930\n\n      Premiere of her first American film, MOROCCO.\n\n   1935\n\n      After seven films together, parting of the ways with her director Josef von Sternberg.\n\n   March 6, 1937\n\n      Became an American citizen.\n\n   1944 - 45\n\n      Entertaining American troops in N.
