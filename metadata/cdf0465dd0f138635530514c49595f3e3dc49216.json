Those without a DTS-MA receiver will still be able to play a 24/48 core DTS stream.\n\nFor those who cannot play a disc in AVCHD, there is brief document included in this torrent as to my own process in extracting mono wavs from discs like these in order to create a disc in another multichannel format.\n\nNotes and disclaimers:\n\nIt is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\nIf you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.\n\nI've never been happy with any attempts at a FM mix I've done. It's the nature of anything with Lindsay's name on it, I'm sure. There's a couple of imperfections here, but I think the good here is REALLY good.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1. &quot;Monday Morning&quot;\n2. &quot;Warm Ways&quot;\n3. &quot;Blue Letter&quot;\n4. &quot;Rhiannon&quot;\n5. &quot;Over My Head&quot;\n6. &quot;Crystal&quot;\n7. &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;\n8. &quot;Landslide&quot;\n9. &quot;World Turning&quot;\n10. &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot;\n11. &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot;\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDKA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdf0465dd0f138635530514c49595f3e3dc49216","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+Fleetwood+Mac+%28SPEC+DTS-MA+5.1+by+DKA%29+%28SBU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdf0465dd0f138635530514c49595f3e3dc49216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,240,70,93,208,241,56,99,85,48,81,76,73,89,95,62,61,196,146,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
