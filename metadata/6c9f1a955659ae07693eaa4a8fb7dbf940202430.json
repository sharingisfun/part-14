Others joining Barry on the album were Chris Hillman, Bernie Leadon, Sneaky Pete, Michael Clarke, Billy Mundy, and Byron Berline. By this time, Barry's drug problem was way beyond any control. The album cover features Barry and Eric, who, in Barry's own words, looked like &quot;two cadavers. Two dead human beings looking out of tombstone eyeballs, I mean just absolute end-of-the-road desolation. One of the guys that produced the album died of a drug overdose. The only reason we didn't die from an overdose is because we didn't make any money on the album.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c9f1a955659ae07693eaa4a8fb7dbf940202430","amp;dn":"Barry+McGuire+%26amp%3B+The+Doctor+-+Barry+McGuire+%26amp%3B+The+Doctor+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c9f1a955659ae07693eaa4a8fb7dbf940202430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,159,26,149,86,89,174,7,105,62,170,74,143,183,219,249,64,32,36,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
