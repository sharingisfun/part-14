Four teenagers set out to search for their missing friend. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve found themselves locked inside the school overnight, and they now have to get to the bottom of the strange occurrences.\n\nYou'll take control of the five desperate teens as you explore the massive school and battle a number of different types of infected students.\n\nThe students discover that the enemies they face are sensitive to light, with direct sunlight being able to destroy them. Flashlights help to slightly weaken their foes and the malevolent black aura surrounding them.\n\nThe students wind up discovering a conspiracy about the injections turning students into mutated monsters, mostly experimentations based on a rare plant spore with the possibility to allow people to live forever. It is discovered that the Nurse and the Principal are over 100 years old but seem only to be in their 60s thanks to the tests they had performed on others.\n\nThe students later come across their principal, who is killed by a teacher seeking to cure himself of the infection caused by Herbert's experiments. Herbert's brother, Leonard, however lurks in the back of that room and seeing his brother dead gets quite angry. He murders the teacher and that leaves Kenny and co. to defeat the biggest mutant seen yet, the first mutant.\n\nAfter defeating him, you return to the gym and inject yourself with the cure. However Leonard returns. After a quick and painless battle, Leonard gives into the sunlight and everything is back to normal.[/b][/center]\n\n[img]http://ps2media.ign.com/ps2/image/article/831/831365/obscure-the-aftermath-20071030105029203_640w.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://pspmedia.ign.com/psp/image/article/103/1032042/obscure-the-aftermath-20091006113702192_640w.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2005/108/reviews/919673_20050419_screen009.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://pcmedia.ign.com/pc/image/article/861/861874/obscure-the-aftermath-20080325000128391.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://pcmedia.ign.com/pc/image/article/861/861874/obscure-the-aftermath-20080325000141156_640w.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://ps2media.ign.com/ps2/image/article/787/787641/obscure-ii-20070511101023542_640w.jpg[/img]\n\n[center][img]http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/122/commentsrappreciated.gif[/img]\n[img]http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/8647/jfkpd3jpg.gif[/img]\n[img]http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/5605/ifacuh.gif[/img]\n[img]http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/8004/avinash.gif[/img]\n[img]http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/5739/2ilm0edjpg.png[/img]\n[img]http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/359/thanksj.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c6fdc8ace00aab0c0a1b6da5843c102a792ba21","amp;dn":"Obscure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c6fdc8ace00aab0c0a1b6da5843c102a792ba21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,111,220,138,206,0,170,176,192,161,182,218,88,67,193,2,167,146,186,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
