From its earliest developments, architecture changed over time and in different cultures in response to changing cultural needs, aesthetic interests, materials, and techniques.\n\nThe Historical Dictionary of Architecture provides information on architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Tadao Ando, Leon Battista Alberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, and Konstantin Stepanovich Melnikov, as well as on famous structures like the Acropolis, the Colosseum, the Forbidden City, Machu Pichu, Notre Dame, the Pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge, and the World Trade Center. The dictionary examines the development of architecture over the centuries through a chronology, an introductory essay, a bibliography, and hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries on the major architects, well-known buildings, time periods, styles, building types, and materials in world architecture.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nAllison Lee Palmer is Professor of Art History at the University of Oklahoma.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:535e5a77f65c64a871ae77f43c0908ebe57a7639","amp;dn":"Historical+Dictionary+of+Architecture+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"535e5a77f65c64a871ae77f43c0908ebe57a7639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,94,90,119,246,92,100,168,113,174,119,244,60,9,8,235,229,122,118,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
