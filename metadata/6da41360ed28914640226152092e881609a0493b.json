It's a fun ride down memory lane, highlighted by a lively version of &quot;I'm an Old Cowhand&quot; and the classic &quot;You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me.&quot; If you like the music of this period, get nostalgic for old movies, or still find yourself whistling the songs from old cartoons, you'll be in your element here. At this stage in his career a quickly rising star, Crosby was still a crooner; the warm, deep baritone of his later efforts isn't always in evidence here. While Crosby's voice is clearly the lead instrument, he's nearly upstaged by the Mills Brothers on a few songs, notably &quot;Dinah&quot; and &quot;My Honey's Loving Arms,&quot; where all manner of horns are impersonated. The Dorsey Brothers also get some real swingin' arrangements under the soaring voice of Crosby on &quot;Somebody Stole Gabriel's Horn&quot; and &quot;I'm an Old Cowhand.&quot; The songs are recorded with a variety of backing orchestras, including those led by Lennie Hayton, Jimmie Grier, Guy Lombardo, Bernie Krueger, and Frank Trumbauer. The love songs are perhaps the best settings for Bing Crosby, as he wilts over the lyrics on songs like &quot;June in January,&quot; &quot;Shadow Waltz,&quot; and &quot;Here Lies Love.&quot; Portrait of Bing Crosby is a well-preserved picture of the artist as a young man. - All Music Guide - Dave Connolly\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Please\n[02] How Deep Is The Ocean\n[03] Dancing In The Dark\n[04] Sentimental And Melancholy\n[05] On The Sentimental Side\n[06] Don't Be That Way\n[07] Blue Hawaii\n[08] Silver On The Sage\n[09] Song Of The Islands\n[10] The Last Round-Up\n[11] Black Moonlight\n[12] Someday Sweetheart\n[13] I've Got The World On A String\n[14] Did You Ever See A Dream Walking\n[15] Dinah\n[16] Brother, Can You Spare A Dime\n[17] Pennies From Heaven\n[18] Down The Old Ox Road\n[19] Maybe\n[20] Thanks\n[21] In My Merry Oldsmobile\n[22] Moonlight Becomes You\n[23] Remember Me\n[24] It's Easy To Remember\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:12m:47s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Sweet And Lovely\n[02] Too Romantic\n[03] This Is My Night To Dream\n[04] Temptation\n[05] Try A Little Tenderness\n[06] Star Dust\n[07] Sweet Leilani\n[08] I'm An Old Cowhand\n[09] Goodnight Sweetheart\n[10] The Funny Old Hills\n[11] Too Marvellous For Words\n[12] Out Of Nowhere\n[13] (I Don't Stand) A Ghost Of A Chance With You\n[14] An Apple For The Teacher\n[15] Sweet Georgia Brown\n[16] If You Should Ever Need Me\n[17] Still The Bluebird Sings\n[18] Were You Sincere\n[19] Sing A Song Of Sunbeams\n[20] You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me\n[21] Only Forever\n[22] You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby\n[23] The Moon Got In My Eyes\n[24] White Christmas\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 01h:12m27:s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 02h:25m:14s\nTotal File Size....................... 342mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
