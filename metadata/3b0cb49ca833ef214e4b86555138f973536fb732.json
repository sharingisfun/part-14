Just this once, be the bad guy!\n\nOverview:\nBeing the Dungeon Keeper and all, this is your home, too. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your business to take these loathsome creatures of darkness and hone them into screaming, frothing, clawing forces of destruction. You lure them in with food and the promise of dank and fetid places to sleep. You keep them in line with the back of your hand and the threat of dire consequences. You pit their scaly hides against the best that the Forces of Good can muster, and they die for you as they rip steaming entrails out of the hapless heroes.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a degenerate and nasty jobÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ And you love it. Yes, home its where you heart is. In a box. Packed in salt. That's right--Dungeon Keeper, Bullfrog's classic dungeon management strategy, gives you no extra credit for having any morals. After all, the underworld isn't black and white!\n\n\nInstall and Play.\n\nOther:\nGenre:........................................strategy / action / fantasy\nDownload size:...........................187 MB\nRelease date:.............................June 26, 1997\nCompatible with:........................Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8)\nLanguages:................................English\nDeveloper / Publisher:................Bullfrog Productions / Electronic Arts\nGame modes:.............................single-player, multi-player\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: MATURE with Animated Blood and Gore, Animated Violence.\n\n\nBonus content included:\nmanual\n7 artworks\navatar\n12 dev team photos\nwallpaper\n\nSystem Requirements:\nMinimum system requirements:Windows XP or Windows Vista, 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended), 2GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b0cb49ca833ef214e4b86555138f973536fb732","amp;dn":"Dungeon+Keeper+%5BVersion+2.0.0.2%5D%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b0cb49ca833ef214e4b86555138f973536fb732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,12,180,156,168,51,239,33,78,75,134,85,81,56,249,115,83,111,183,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
