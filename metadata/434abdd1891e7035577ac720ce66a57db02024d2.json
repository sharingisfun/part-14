The lack of liner notes adds to the slapped-together feel, but it's a decent pastiche of material that found a home on the L.A. label in the early half of the '60s, though a good deal of the cuts by the Lively Ones, Bobby Fuller, the Centurions, and others can be found on other Del-Fi comps. As far as enticing collectibles go, the &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; ripoff by the American Four tops the list, as it features a pre-Love Arthur Lee as lead vocalist. There are also three hot rod instrumentals by the Darts with Glen Campbell on guitar, a Buddy Hollyish number by Dick Dale, and future Beach Boy Bruce Johnston's &quot;Do the Surfer Stomp.&quot; \n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/sun--surf-cars-and-guitars-r237669&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/sun--surf-cars-and-guitars-r237669&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001JIZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001JIZ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
