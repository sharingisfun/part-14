The Raja who rules the land welcomes them. However, as his three brothers are soon to be executed for murder by the British, his subjects believe that their Green Goddess has delivered into their hands three victims for their revenge. The three are to be killed once the brothers are dead. The Raja professes to his guests no great love for his brothers, as they had posed a danger to the succession of his own children, but sees no reason to anger his people. However, he becomes attracted to Lucilla and offers to spare her life if she will become his wife. She refuses.\r\n\r\nOriginally released with sound on disc, sound on film was added at a later date, resulting in the left side of the image in surviving prints noticeably cropped in order to provide space on which to accommodate the soundtrack.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 608x448, 23.976 fps, 1325 Kbps, 01h12m59s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, mono, 60 kbps\r\n\r\nTVRip brief TCM watermark, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/99fdxjsn7/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/pr2b1ht5t/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/3qlykvaht/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/7lpcnftnl/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jz26ucjc1/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef62c20a14e3a0630b732fa113956b63bc358aed","amp;dn":"The+Green+Goddess+-+1930+%28Academy+Award+Nominee%29+adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef62c20a14e3a0630b732fa113956b63bc358aed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,98,194,10,20,227,160,99,11,115,47,161,19,149,107,99,188,53,138,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
