Thomas - Confessions of a Sociopath: A Life Spent Hiding in Plain Sight\n\n 96 kbps, Unabridged, Read by Bernadette Sullivan\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/confessions-of-a-sociopath-me-thomas/1112570788?ean=9780307956644&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/confessions-of-a-sociopath-me-thomas/1112570788?ean=9780307956644&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOverview\nAs M.E. Thomas says of her fellow sociopaths, we are your neighbors, co-workers, and quite possibly the people closest to you: lovers, family, friends. Our risk-seeking behavior and general fearlessness are thrilling, our glibness and charm alluring. Our often quick wit and outside-the-box thinking make us appear intelligentÃ¢â‚¬â€even brilliant. We climb the corporate ladder faster than the rest, and appear to have limitless self-confidence. Who are we? We are highly successful, non-criminal sociopaths and we comprise 4% of the American population (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1 in 25 people!).\n\nConfessions of a Sociopath takes readers on a journey into the mind of a sociopath, revealing what makes the tick and what that means for the rest of humanity. Written from the point of view of a diagnosed sociopath, it unveils these men and women who are Ã¢â‚¬Å“hiding in plain sightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for the very first time.\n\nConfessions of a Sociopath is part confessional memoir, part primer for the wary. Drawn from ThomasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own experiences; her popular blog, Sociopathworld.com; and current and historical scientific literature, it reveals just how different Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and yet often very similar - sociopaths are from the rest of the world. The book confirms suspicions and debunks myths about sociopathy and is both the memoir of a high-functioning, law-abiding (well, mostly) sociopath and a roadmap Ã¢â‚¬â€œ right from the source - for dealing with the sociopath in your life, be it a boss, sibling, parent, spouse, child, neighbor, colleague or friend.\n\nAs Thomas argues, while sociopaths aren't like everyone else, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true some of them are incredibly dangerous, they are not inherently evil. In fact, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re potentially more productive and useful to society than neurotypicals or Ã¢â‚¬Å“empaths,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as they fondly like to call Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ people. Confessions of a Sociopath demystifyies sociopathic behavior and provide readers with greater insight on how to respond or react to protect themselves, live among sociopaths without becoming victims, and even beat sociopaths at their own game, through a bit of empathetic cunning and manipulation.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nThe biting memoir of a &quot;successful&quot; sociopath, from the pseudonymous Thomas. The author is a lawyer, a teacher and a sociopath--she abjures &quot;psycho&quot; as a little too much--a full-blown example of anti-social personality behavior, with &quot;a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others&quot;--not in a legally criminal way but certainly capable of inflicting damage. Her self-portrait is not likable, but readers will admire her drawing attention to all the sociopaths out there. &quot;We are legion and diverse,&quot; she writes. &quot;At least one of them looks like me. Does one of them look like you?&quot; Thomas treats her life as a case history, reaching for cognizance while pulsing with a frankness that roves between raw self-evaluation--which might be disarming if she had more emotional capacity--and an undiluted meanness toward those she would ruin, the many &quot;gloomy, mediocre nothings populating a go-nowhere rat race.&quot; She scours her past to see where her sociopathy was nurtured and genetics to see where it might have found a foothold through nature. She invites us into her courtroom, classroom and bedroom to witness how her behavior has stunted her work life and made her love life difficult. She explains her view of risks and consequences, &quot;but my mind is almost always at peace no matter what I do.&quot; Much here is chilling, but there are also cracks that make you ache for her: &quot;Sometimes I can't see people's disgust for me because I'm so single-mindedly inclined to see adoration.&quot; A work of advocacy for greater awareness of sociopathy's reach and conduct.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:591eb45cd261a92bc12c024e1c634b54518b5369","amp;dn":"M.E.+Thomas+-+Confessions+of+a+Sociopath+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"591eb45cd261a92bc12c024e1c634b54518b5369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,30,180,92,210,97,169,43,193,44,2,78,28,99,75,84,81,139,83,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
