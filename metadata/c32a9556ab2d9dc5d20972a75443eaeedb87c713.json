Key images and objectsÃ¢â‚¬â€some of them familiar works of art; others, less known but equally crucial to the storyÃ¢â‚¬â€act as landmarks on the journey, focal points around which the discussion always centers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32a9556ab2d9dc5d20972a75443eaeedb87c713","amp;dn":"Mirror+of+the+World%3A+A+New+History+of+Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32a9556ab2d9dc5d20972a75443eaeedb87c713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,42,149,86,171,45,157,197,210,9,114,167,84,67,234,238,219,135,199,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
