Yet as a personality, Piero remains a mystery. He leaves an enigmatic legacy that ranges from the merging of religion and mathematics to his use of perspective to make painting a Ã¢â‚¬Å“true science.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn this engaging narrative, Larry Witham transports us to PieroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tumultuous age, a world of princes and popes, soldiers and schisms. PieroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Light also reveals how he was part of the philosophical revival of Platonism, an ancient worldview that would shape art, religion, and scienceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transition toward modernity. Just sixteen of PieroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paintings survive, but these images and his writings would fuel some of the greatest art historical debates of all time.\n\nThrough WithamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wide research, Piero emerges as a figure who marks a turning point in Western culture. Our past understanding of faith, beauty, and knowledge has been radically altered by a secular age, and the story of Piero helps us understand how this has taken place. The search for Piero has continued among both intrepid scholars and art lovers of all kinds, and it is no wonder: few artists in history take us as deeply into the intellectual excitement of the Renaissance as Piero della Francesca","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e740a3f4b220cfd62773efd90bb5a19f4e7a1b8","amp;dn":"Pieros+Light%2C+in+Search+of+Piero+della+Francesca+-+A+Renaissance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e740a3f4b220cfd62773efd90bb5a19f4e7a1b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,116,10,63,75,34,12,253,98,119,62,253,144,187,90,25,244,231,161,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
