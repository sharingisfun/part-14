Although its wisdom is over two thousand years old, its principles are timeless for today's boardroom battlefields. Thirteen sections present incisive strategems from assessing the foe to proper treatment of troops to espionage. Hanshi Steve Kaufman, the widely acknowledged &quot;Founding Father&quot; of American Karate, translates this classic with respect for its powerful martial applications. Kaufman packs the power of the original text into straightforward prose for the benefits of all martial artists and corporate warriors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad817dd5f29b6da6ab8e02394a0b8322ec81716","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+War%3A+The+Definitive+Interpretation+%281996%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad817dd5f29b6da6ab8e02394a0b8322ec81716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,216,23,221,95,41,182,218,106,184,224,35,148,160,184,50,46,200,23,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
