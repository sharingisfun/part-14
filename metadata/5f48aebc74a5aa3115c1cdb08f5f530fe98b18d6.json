They were signed to EMI at the same time as Pink Floyd, and both bands moved over to the company's progressive rock-oriented Harvest imprint at the same time, yet somehow, they never managed to connect with the public for a major hit in England, much less America. Their relationship endured through nine studio albums and two live doubles, the period of BJH's history which most fans regard as their most creative and productive, and their musical collaborations included such classics as 'Mocking Bird' and 'Child Of The Universe'.\n\n- - -\n\nFrom the very beginning, BJH experimented with new forms, going beyond the traditional guitar, bass and drums format to include woodwind, strings and brass, then acquiring a Mellotron to simulate the sound of an orchestra.\n\n- - -\n\nBarclay James Harvest - Mockingbird 1976-1988\n(Spectrum Music 2001)\n\n 1.
