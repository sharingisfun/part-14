Hoynes resigns from his post as part of a planned leadership bid - which is thwarted by his friend, the equally ambitious (and hugely devious) Bruce Babbish (Ed Stoppard) who was aided by Chief Whip Marcus Brock (Roger Allam). Freya, who had to temporarily stall her career to look after her two children Noah and Ruby, replaces Hoynes in Cabinet and is faced with the decision to publicly support husband or further her political ambitions by condemning him. Away from Westminster, husband and wife face an uncertain future as they come to terms with the diagnosis that Noah (Oscar Kennedy) has Asperger's syndrome.\n\nPlease seed after you download!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8760c7027ba67231a07b3414c0e2400540ae7339","amp;dn":"The+Politician%27s+Husband+%28UK%29+COMPLETE+Series+%282013%29+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8760c7027ba67231a07b3414c0e2400540ae7339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,96,199,2,123,166,114,49,160,123,52,20,192,226,64,5,64,174,115,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
