Chisu Ryu plays another of Ozu&amp;#039;s realistic middle-class types, this time a widower with a marriageable daughter. Not wishing to see the girl resign herself to spinsterhood, Ryu pretends that he himself is about to be married. The game plan is to convince the daughter that they&amp;#039;ll be no room for her at home, thus forcing her to seek comfort and joy elsewhere. What makes this homey little domestic episode work is the rapport between Chisu Ryu and Setsuko Hara, who plays the daughter. Late Spring is no facile Hollywood farce; we like these people, believe in them, and wish them the best.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Late.Spring.1949.DVDRip.XviD-FRAGMENT.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 699 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 897 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 13.1 MiB\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 814 Kbps\n      Width : 560 pixels\n      Height : 416 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.144\n      StreamSize : 628 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 74 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 57.4 MiB\n      Writing library : Xing (new)\n\nIMDB: tt0041154\n\nJapanese audio, English subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:131a8f1f1859080478e45abf02227cdeab839c09","amp;dn":"Yasujiro+Ozu+%281949%29+Late+Spring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"131a8f1f1859080478e45abf02227cdeab839c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,26,143,31,24,89,8,4,120,228,90,191,2,34,124,222,171,131,156,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
