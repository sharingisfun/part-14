Misra, BSc(Hons), MBBS, FRCS, FRCR ,\nM.C. Uthappa, BSc, MBBS, FRCS, FRCR\nPradip K. Datta, MS, FRCS (Ed.), FRCS (Eng.), FRCS (Irel.), FRCS (Glasg.)\n\nBook Description\nImaging is now an almost routine part of the first-line investigation of many patient conditions and, as such, it is vital that the surgeon has an understanding of how to rapidly interpret and diagnose all forms of images (plain film, CT, MRI etc.). Radiology for Surgeons is a superbly illustrated guide to interpreting all forms of images, aimed specifically at the trainee general surgeon. Information is presented by organ/system, and each 'case' is illustrated with high quality halftones and superb gross colour specimen illustrations where necessary to highlight underlying pathology. All 'cases' follow a consistent format, which aids understanding and rapid access to and assimilation of information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c4d68e192c436047e08124b38bae6e794b8aff","amp;dn":"Radiology+for+Surgeons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c4d68e192c436047e08124b38bae6e794b8aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,196,214,142,25,44,67,96,71,224,129,36,179,139,174,110,121,75,138,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
