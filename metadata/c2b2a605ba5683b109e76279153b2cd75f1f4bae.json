We've taken KKnD and rebuilt it for Windows '95, also adding new game modes and new missions. KKnD Xtreme takes the original game and enhances it with a huge list of improvements. KKnD Xtreme is a stand-alone product that includes all 30 KKnD missions, plus 20 new missions that will tax even the best KKnD players.\n\nIn addition to the extra missions we've listened to our customers and included many of the features most asked for, including a skirmish mode and a host of interface and gameplay movements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2b2a605ba5683b109e76279153b2cd75f1f4bae","amp;dn":"KKND+Xtreme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2b2a605ba5683b109e76279153b2cd75f1f4bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,178,166,5,186,86,131,177,9,231,98,121,21,59,44,215,95,31,75,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
