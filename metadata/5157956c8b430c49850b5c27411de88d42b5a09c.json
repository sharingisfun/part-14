In this NOVA program, our cinematographer literally filmed inside a hive and followed bees in flight to capture closeups of honeybee behavior.\nAnatomy of a Hive\nA hive is more than just a buzz of activity. The social organization rivals that in the best-run corporations, with each bee and each cell possessing a rigidly specific function. Have a look at the physical, behavioral, and social infrastructure inside a bees' nest. \n\nThe Buzz About Bees\nDid you know that on average it takes the nectar from 10 million flowers to make one liter of honey? That a worker bee can carry half her weight in nectar and pollen and still fly? Beguile yourself with these and other fascinating facts about bees. \n\n\nRespect \nBadBoy \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5157956c8b430c49850b5c27411de88d42b5a09c","amp;dn":"Bees+Tales+from+the+hive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5157956c8b430c49850b5c27411de88d42b5a09c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,87,149,108,139,67,12,73,133,11,92,39,65,29,232,141,66,181,160,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
