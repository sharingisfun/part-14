Just before Stephen was born, his father was offered a job at Princeton University but turned it down. As a result, Stephen was born in NW3 rather than in NJ, New Jersey. In this six-part series he travels, mostly in a London cab, through all 50 states of the country that he could have nearly called home and which has always fascinated him.\nIn this six-part series he travels, mostly in a London cab, through all 50 states of the country that he could have nearly called home and which has always fascinated him.\n\n\n1)  New World \nIn this first episode, he explores the states that make up New England, before heading south to the nation's capital and ending up at the civil war battlefield of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. Presidential hopefuls in New Hampshire, witches in Salem, nuclear submariners in Connecticut, deer hunters, small time mobsters in NYC, socialites in Rhode Island, lobster fishermen in Maine, ice cream blenders in Vermont and card washers in New Jersey - Stephen meets them all as he takes the road through the autumn colours to uncover what really makes America tick.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/9604/inamericascreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/9604/inamericascreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/3903/inamericascreen1s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/3903/inamericascreen1s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/1232/inamericascreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/1232/inamericascreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img529.imageshack.us/img529/7525/inamericascreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img529.imageshack.us/img529/7525/inamericascreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/2212/inamericascreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/2212/inamericascreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/131/inamericascreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/131/inamericascreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/1600/inamericascreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/1600/inamericascreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/9254/inamericascreen7y.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/9254/inamericascreen7y.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img156.imageshack.us/img156/2803/inamericascreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img156.imageshack.us/img156/2803/inamericascreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1533 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704x400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 224kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59:01.mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 745 MB\n * Subtitles: None\n * Ripped by: artistharry\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://british-tv.suite101.com/article.cfm/stephen_fry_in_america_bbc_one&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://british-tv.suite101.com/article.cfm/stephen_fry_in_america_bbc_one&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3781c00cda03fa0d630431629ed0a33dea28a8","amp;dn":"BBC+Stephen+Fry+in+America+1of6+New+World+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3781c00cda03fa0d630431629ed0a33dea28a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,55,129,192,12,218,3,250,13,99,4,49,98,158,208,163,61,234,40,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
