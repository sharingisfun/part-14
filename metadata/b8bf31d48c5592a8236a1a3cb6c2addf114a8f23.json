His genre is technically metal, but he claims that &quot;amnaeon does not have a genre. Regardless of what type of music you listen to, I highly recommend giving it a chance. You won't disappointed.&quot; Justin Bonitz does vocals, guitar, drums, and keyboard all himself. I downloaded his songs from(by reverse engineering and extracting them from the online player of course, hence the low quality). All of these files have accurate id3 tags, written by me.\n\nIf you like the music, please visit his bandcamp and buy the songs. The albums are $5 each and available in several qualities including 320kbps mp3 and FLAC. You can also find a lot of covers on soundcloudlet me know if you want me to rip that aswell.\n\nAorta Borealis IV\n-Aphotic Currents 10          (128 kb/s)\n-Everything That Exists       (128 kb/s)\n-The Default Illusion         (128 kb/s)\n-Meeting Arilayah             (128 kb/s)\n-Kar'tahn                     (128 kb/s)\t\n-Undefined                    (128 kb/s)\n-Aphotic Currents 11          (128 kb/s)\n-The Undergrowth              (128 kb/s)\n-Eair'tra City Of Kings       (128 kb/s)\n-Return To The Arc            (128 kb/s)\n-Fothcrah                     (128 kb/s)\n-The Maker's Tale             (128 kb/s)\n-The Worst Of Evils           (128 kb/s)\n-Aphotic Currents 12          (128 kb/s)\n\nThe Proamates III\n-Aphotic Currents 7           (128 kb/s)\n-Prite &amp; Prill                (128 kb/s)\n-Contempt                     (128 kb/s)\n-Nine Years Later             (128 kb/s)\n-The Temple Of Knowledge      (128 kb/s)\t\n-The Door &amp; The Mountain      (128 kb/s)\n-One Priest One Stone         (128 kb/s)\n-Aphotic Currents 8           (128 kb/s)\n-Humbra                       (128 kb/s)\n-Underpinning Of General Reem (128 kb/s)\n-The Anti-human               (128 kb/s)\n-Simulating The Effects       (128 kb/s)\n-A Father's End               (128 kb/s)\n-Aphotic Currents 9           (128 kb/s)\n\n\n*** I have also created an index of my music related torrents and a section for requests at MrSp3kt (dot) webs (dot) com ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8bf31d48c5592a8236a1a3cb6c2addf114a8f23","amp;dn":"Amnaeon+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8bf31d48c5592a8236a1a3cb6c2addf114a8f23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,191,49,212,140,85,146,168,35,106,26,60,182,194,173,223,17,74,143,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
