The heroine of the first novel in an exciting sci-fi / fantasy series for young adult readers is about to find out. \nIt explores the struggle of Juno, a young teen on the verge of adulthood, who is torn between her need to fit in and belong in her society, and her growing discomfort and questioning of that society's rules. Your ordinary teen? Not quite! Because Juno lives - in the not-too-distant future - on Taris, a bubble-covered island in the Pacific, to which a select few hundred people were evacuated when Earth's inhabitants took everything just a bit too far and began to self-destruct.\n\nOn Taris there are many rules governing appearance, behaviour, even procreation, but all are for the good of the community, to ensure the survival of humankind. Or are they? As Taris' protected environment begins to break down and Juno's questioning nature takes hold, she uncovers some startling inconsistencies in many of the 'factual' histories she has grown up with. She also begins to develop some quite startling, almost supernatural, abilities. As Juno faces increasing danger, she finds allies in the most surprising places.\nJuno of Taris examines many themes: peer pressure, environmental breakdown, the fictionalization of history, societal control and challenging authority. But perhaps most important of all, it is a thoroughly good read from one of New Zealand's very best writers for young adults.\n\n\nTitle 2:\nFIERCE SEPTEMBER Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Book 2\n\nDescription:\nJuno of Taris faces more dangers in the second in the award-winning science fiction / fantasy young adult novel series. Juno and the Taris inhabitants must leave their dying island. The young people look forward to a wider life Outside, but Outside too has its problems. It is two-year-old Hera, with her uncanny ability to foresee events, who saves the Taris people from the injury and death prepared for them by an underground group of protestors. The people of Taris, though, have no choice but to try to live in this seemingly hostile place. The young people are entranced despite the hate campaign against them: there are the fashions, the technologies and best of all for Juno, the freedom from extreme control.\nOnly days after the group arrives, a pandemic hits the country - this has drastic consequences for Juno and her people. Once the pandemic is over, life settles down and the question now for Juno is to find her way among the choices open to her, some of which cause her parents to fear she is abandoning the values they hold so dear. Juno was relieved to put Taris behind her. But Taris doesn't give up its hold so easily - she is shocked to find the island held more secrets than any of them knew. She wants to bury her head, ignore what she's discovered and forge ahead to find her own place in this new world. She falls for Ivan, a young man who seems to understand her, but love is a fey thing. What will become of her?\n\n\nTitle 3:\nHEART OF DANGER Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Book 3\n\nDescription:\nThe exciting third and final book in the Juno series of gripping, sci-fi / fantasy YA novels. Heart of Danger is a rollicking good read that veers between quite terrifying situations and Juno's discoveries about love and the powers of her own mind. Juno and her family arrive at their new home, but almost immediately danger threatens Hera and they move to Willem's protection in New Plymouth, the city Juno most hoped to avoid. Fairlands school is too like Taris, and Hilto's son Thomas is a pupil there. The handsome Ivor is also there, and soon begins to pay attention to Juno in a way she finds both confusing and exciting. Juno's special mind powers are called upon to help her save Hera. \n\n\nTitle 4:\nSINS OF THE FATHER: The Long Shadow of a Religious Cult\n\nDescription:\nThe disturbing story of the ruthless exercise of power in a New Zealand religious cult. Charismatic, driven and self-righteous, Neville Cooper set up his own brand of Christian utopia on earth: a reclusive community on the West Coast of New Zealand. For the 400 inhabitants of Gloriavale, his word is law - despite his 1995 conviction for sexual abuse. His son Phil Cooper, as headstrong as his father, had to escape. But Phil's wife Sandy was bound to the will of Neville and his brand of eternal salvation. And so began the monumental tug-of-war between father and son: a son who wanted to give his children a chance in the world. This is a true story of power and control, of abductions and night raids, of hearts broken and those trying to mend. It's also the story of the long shadow cast by the unyielding vision of one man, and the hope and resolve of one family to restore its shattered past.\n\n\nTitle 5:\nDIRT BOMB\n\nDescription:\nJake's life is sweet. He's got no money and doesn't have a mobile, but he's got two best mates; Buzz and Robbie. Buzz is generous and doesn't mind buying stuff for his mates. Jake wouldn't change a thing. But then Robbie has the idea of the century: rescue the old wreck from the ditch and make it into a paddock basher. Yes! Buzz, however, puts a spanner in the works by saying he's not paying for it all. Even stevens or no deal. Robbie gets a job. Jake refuses. It's just not his style to work for a boss. But he desperately wants to drive that car, and the others are going to go ahead without him. The summer holidays are looming ahead of him in a desert of boredom and friendlessness. He needs a game plan.\n\nA writer with an uncanny understanding of young male teenagers, Fleur Beale also wrote Slide the Corner which won the Storylines Much-Loved Book Award - and teachers have been crying out for more books in this genre. Dirt Bomb fills this gap beautifully.\n\n\nTitle 6:\nEND OF THE ALPHABET\n\nDescription:\nHaving a dream and aiming for it . . . a gentle coming-of-age novel for girls by much-loved YA novelist Fleur Beale.\n\nRuby Yarrow is a 14 year old who lives in a busy, loving, chaotic family with her mum, stepdad, brother and two little stepbrothers. Ruby feels a bit like a doormat - she has to help out while her brother doesn't. He wins lots of prizes at school but she has a learning difficulty and needs a reader/writer to help her in exams. What's more, her surname, Yarrow, is at the end of the alphabet and when the roll gets called out she's always at the end. She hates it. She feels she's always at the end of the line. Not that Ruby is a misery bag at all. She's bright, vibrant and a really neat character. She has great friends and loves clothes, fashion magazines and sewing, which she has a real knack for. She's very keen to go on the school trip to Brazil and so she gets a job to earn the money for her airfare, working in a supermarket for an old grump. She also learns a bit of Portuguese and meeting exchange students. Ruby doesn't get to go on the trip but she stands up to her parents, gets some backbone and starts to see herself in a much better light.\n\n\n\nTitle 7:\nI AM NOT ESTHER\n\nDescription:\nA classic bestseller that's been in print for over 20 years, this gripping Young Adult thriller follows a teenage girl caught in a religious cult.
