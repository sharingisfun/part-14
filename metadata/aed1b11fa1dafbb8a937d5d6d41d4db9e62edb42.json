A wealthy, well-landed scion of an old family, he kept a flock of tame wandering pigeons, each of whom had all its feathers dyed a unique color. He wrote a surrealistic novel supposedly about the mystery surrounding the appearance of a camel in a stolid British village, and wrote some of the strangest, dry-witted music of his day. (He would have written more, he later stated, if he had only accepted fewer luncheon invitations.)\r\n\r\nThe Triumph of Neptune was a ballet with visuals and plot deliberately cast in the manner of late 19th century prints. The hero is an average English sailor who's adventures include visiting the world undersea, where Neptune's daughter can't resist his spirit. He also gets drunk, being a sailor, and mangles a once-popular favorite song, The Last Rose of Summer. Beecham loved the score, and was the first to issue a recording of it--more than one, in fact. This was his last.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio's enclosed.
