She swiftly shifts from sexy and sultry-bordering-on-masochistic to a haunting waltz backed by a looped angelic voice that belongs on GoldfrappÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœUtopiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, each cleverly opposing one another but combined to build what is often a kooky and colourful, occasionally macabre masterpiece.\nWears The Trousers Magazine UK \n\nSome might call it folk noirÃ¢â‚¬â€pish! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s far more brooding than thatÃ¢â‚¬â€imagine a female-fronted Gogol Bordello crawling through molasses and holding hands with Stephin Merritt.\nSee Magazine, CA \n\nMcNeillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deft language is enhanced by a musical landscape that weaves a host of orchestral textures and layers of her vocals together, exquisitely aching and beautifully realized.\nVue Weekly, CA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da5c6cb45f157bb5dcf7f1a19b073adb0a8a68a","amp;dn":"Wendy+McNeill+-+One+Colour+More+%5B2014%5D+%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1da5c6cb45f157bb5dcf7f1a19b073adb0a8a68a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,165,198,203,69,241,87,187,93,207,127,26,25,176,115,173,176,168,166,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
