The recent advancements in science as well as technologies, have aided in prolonging human lives, and with that, newer challenges have surfaced as to the quality of this extended life. Thus identifying causes and types of functional impairments with different organ systems and methods of management of these impairments are very crucial. \nThe human body is a complex system; any organ impairment can lead to functional disability. This book is written by experts in different fields of science and medicine and focuses on functional abnormalities as it relates to different organsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ disabilities. Different chapters discuss functional impairments in association with brain, lungs, kidneys, joints and laryngeal diseases. Each of these organsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ disability could be associated with a unique type of functional impairment that affects the longevity and /or quality of life of these patients. Our ultimate aim from this book is to shed some light on this important topic of functional impairment, and to discuss the various causes, manifestations and managements of these impairments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54be23faebbeeee0af61e61078da2eff027000ca","amp;dn":"Functional+Impairment+%28Nova%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54be23faebbeeee0af61e61078da2eff027000ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,190,35,250,235,190,238,224,175,97,230,16,120,218,46,255,2,112,0,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
