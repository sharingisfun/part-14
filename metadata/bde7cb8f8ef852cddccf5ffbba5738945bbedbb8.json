Due to that, her photos appear on the newspaper, since that moment they'd have to run away.\n\nHidden places, false disguises and names are the daily life of THE GIRL, the narrator of the story. Alongside with her cousin (Teo), they re-live the adventures of their guerrilla parents, building up a labrynth with superheroes and strategies, in which nobody knows where the reality (or madness) begins. However, this children's game does not hide the deaths, tortures, denunciations and treasons within the guerrillas.\n\nThe kids want to convert themseleves into The Invisible Man, in order to escape from the danger. However, they know that their parents might never comeback and therefore, they'll only receive Postcards from Leningrad.\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
