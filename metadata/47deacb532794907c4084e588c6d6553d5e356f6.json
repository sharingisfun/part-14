Or driven in your car to the other side of town--as the crow flies? Of course not! Because you instinctively know that, just as a river has to wend its way around obstacles, the best route is never actually a straight line!\n\nIn The Zigzag Principle, Rich Christiansen applies a foundational law of nature to business management, entrepreneurship, goal-setting, and life in general as he explores why zigzagging toward our intended outcomes is more effective than trying to bulldoze our way through whatever stands between us and our objectives.\n\nChristiansen helps you get started, make your way over the big hill to initial profitability, and minimize risks along the way. A s the head of well-established corporations and as the brains behind numerous start-ups, Christiansen has been through it all, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charted all the zigs and zags youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll encounter.\n\nIn The Zigzag Principle, he documents everything he has learned, including how to:\n\nIdentify your destination\nCreate a defined set of values to help you as your business finds its way\nAdd resources and hire the right people, as you turn the cash you have into fuel for more\nReplicate your successes to bring your product to the masses\nProtect your resources, your family, and your sanity\n\nThe simplicity of a straight line can be seductive. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a realistic way to go about achieving your goals, because you will always come upon unexpected obstacles in the road. Zigzagging requires you to be nimble and flexible, to Ã¢â‚¬Å“bootstrap,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and to be able to take advantage of multiple opportunities. What it delivers is success--in business and in life--far beyond your initial plans and dreams.\n\nUse The Zigzag Principle to assess your resources, use them to their fullest, and keep yourself and your team motivated--all while living a life of balance.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nRich Christiansen spent the first half of his career as an executive, running the PC division of Mitsubishi Electronics, working at Novell, and becoming general manager ofToday, he is in high demand as a mentor and small business consultant.
