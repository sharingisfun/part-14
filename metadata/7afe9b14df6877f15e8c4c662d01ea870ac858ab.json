Performing all guitars and bass himself (as well as a little electric sitar), ex-Journey sticksman Steve Smith has assumed drumming duties; composer, producer and keyboardist Igor Len features on acoustic piano; and the legendary Jan Hammer, with whom Schon has previously collaborated, contributes Moog to a couple of tracks. A purely instrumental affair, 'The Calling' is a fairly diverse beast containing twelve cuts coloured with the stylistic disparity that's characterised Schon's long and varied career. So we have classic rock, blues, funk, jazz fusion, prog and moments of guitar-centric ambience. And the album shines through its diversity; meandering through, and switching, genres with pleasingly stimulating results - a quality that's key to the success of any instrumental album.\n\nAs one would expect, it's Schon's guitar licks and solos that largely dominate proceedings - after all, this is billed as a Neal Schon solo record - although the sonic backdrop over which he exercises his fretboard dynamic is not merely dismissive muzak. Rather 'The Calling' has a series of well-composed, skilfully executed and produced/mixed instrumental pieces that Schon has adorned with his lead work. With the calibre of musician involved, I suppose this is a given, although Len and Smith should be given equal credit for the resultant music. Notably, Len's acoustic piano on 'Carnival Jazz' is rather astounding, and Smith's drumming shines during the more up-tempo passages, providing a solid impetus for the tracks. Then there's Jan Hammer's Moog synths which are particularly magnificent on the prog/fusion piece 'Fifty Six', bringing to mind his work with jazz/rock fusion pioneer John McLaughlin in the Mahavishnu Orchestra. In this sense, it's refreshing to see Schon integrating and utilising Hammer's talents in an apposite context rather than merely recruiting him for a random guest slot. Hammer only appears on two tracks but he certainly makes his mark.\n\nThe emotions at the core of the music, though, are largely conveyed through Schon's soloing, and his guitar sounds at its most poignantly stirring on 'Blue Rainbow Sky' with a beautifully warm tone and melody-driven leads. A tribute to Ronnie James Dio which, in Schon's words, is centred around &quot;the night he died outside my house - the sky was blue and it's that feeling that was the inspiration for the recording&quot;, it's a captivating piece and heartfelt tribute. That's just one example, though, as Schon's affectively expressive playing covers a whole gamut of emotions on an album that has much to offer through, at times, a mixed palette of instrumental music that should excite the casual listener as much as the muso hordes who thrive on this sort of thing.\n\n\nNeal Schon At MySpace\n\n\n\n\n\nI would say that there are only a handful of guitarists that could pull off an album of guitar leads Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jeff Beck is definitely one and Joe Satriani another and the third would be Neal Schon.\n\nHe has linked up here with Jan Hammer (alumni of both Jeff Beck and another virtuos John McLaughlin), his bandmate from Journey Steve Smith and Igor Len on piano.\n\nMy immediate reaction was pretty negative Ã¢â‚¬â€œ huge amounts of Jazz-Rock fusion twiddling and a total lack of melody but by the time I got to Ã¢â‚¬ËœSix String WaltzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ I was hearing the songwriting and it was becoming clear that Schon is not just a great soloist but he has a real ear for a huge and vaulting sound Ã¢â‚¬â€œ positively anthemic in scale.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœIrish FieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ changes the mood completely Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a light Celtic lilt underpinning the multi-tracked guitars and a delightful touch of mist about the number but then it is back to the heaviosity on Ã¢â‚¬ËœBack SmashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nHe suggests Eastern influences with electric sitar on Ã¢â‚¬ËœFifty SixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and then gives the listener a fully overblown ballad on Ã¢â‚¬ËœTrue EmotionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Thankfully Ã¢â‚¬ËœPrimal SurgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gets the ear working again and the Vietnamese style percussion against a melodic guitar line is one of the highlights on the album.\nThe closer is Ã¢â‚¬ËœSong Of The Wind IIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and he channels his inner Santana to pretty good effect.\n\nIt isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the album I would choose to take to my grave but it is a set of excellent guitar pieces that reward regular listening and he is one hell of a guitarist.\n\n\n\nGenre:\tRock\nSubgenre:\tInstrumental Guitar Rock\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t123.07 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n12 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afe9b14df6877f15e8c4c662d01ea870ac858ab","amp;dn":"+Neal+Schon+-+The+Calling++mp3+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afe9b14df6877f15e8c4c662d01ea870ac858ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,254,155,20,223,104,119,241,94,140,76,102,45,1,234,135,10,200,88,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
