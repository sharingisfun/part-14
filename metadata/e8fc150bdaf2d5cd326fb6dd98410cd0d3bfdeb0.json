They were created by writer Louise Simonson and artist June Brigman and first appeared in their own series in 1984. The series lasted 62 issues. The characters have since appeared in other books.\n\nPower Pack is noteworthy for being the first team of preteen superheroes in the Marvel Universe and the first in comics to operate without adult supervision. The series was one of the first mainstream Marvel hits supplied through the then-developing direct market, with regular sales estimated in the range of 90Ã¢â‚¬â€œ97,000 per month[1] Ã¢â‚¬â€ considered above average sales for the time. The title retains a cult following and in 2005 was relaunched as a title aimed at younger readers (see below) Ã¢â‚¬â€ though this was eventually declared a separate continuity from that of the original series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8fc150bdaf2d5cd326fb6dd98410cd0d3bfdeb0","amp;dn":"Power+Pack+V1-3%2BCrossovers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8fc150bdaf2d5cd326fb6dd98410cd0d3bfdeb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,252,21,11,218,242,213,205,50,111,182,221,152,65,12,208,211,191,222,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
