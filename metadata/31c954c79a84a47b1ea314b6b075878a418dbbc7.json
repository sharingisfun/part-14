Gowan has been both a solo artist and the current keyboardist and vocalist of the band Styx. His musical style is usually classified in the category of progressive rock.\n\nAt the age of nineteen, he earned an ARCT in classical piano performance from the Royal Conservatory of Music, in Toronto, Ontario. Upon graduation, he enjoyed modest local success with the band Rhinegold in 1976.\n\nAfter the band broke up five years later, Gowan began what was to become a very long and successful solo career under the stage name Gowan, releasing his first album under that name in 1982, which was produced by Rob Freeman and featured Kim Mitchell of Max Webster fame on guitar. This album contained the singles &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Give In&quot; and &quot;Keep Up the Fight&quot;. His 1985 album Strange Animal was his commercial breakthrough in Canada, produced by British producer David Tickle and featuring a more 'theatrical' Gowan, backed by Peter Gabriel's rhythm section players Tony Levin and Jerry Marotta. The album spawned the hit singles &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot;, &quot;(You're a) Strange Animal&quot;, &quot;Guerilla Soldier&quot; and &quot;Cosmetics&quot;. His 1987 follow up Great Dirty World gave him another hit single with &quot;Moonlight Desires,&quot; featuring Jon Anderson (from Yes) on backing vocals as well as the fan favourite &quot;Dedication&quot;.\n\n1990's Lost Brotherhood had a harder rock sound, and featured such players as Red Rider member Ken Greer, ex Coney Hatch six-stringer Steve Shelski and Rush's Alex Lifeson. It produced the singles &quot;Lost Brotherhood&quot;, &quot;All the Lovers in the World&quot;, and &quot;Out of a Deeper Hunger&quot;. This was Gowan's first album for Anthem Records and his first US release.\n\nHe released the more acoustic, adult contemporary ...but you can call me Larry in 1993 under his full name, returning to the Canadian pop charts with &quot;When There's Time for Love&quot;, &quot;Soul's Road&quot; and &quot;Dancing on My Own Ground&quot;. He subsequently released The Good Catches Up in 1995, which featured the single &quot;Guns and God&quot;, which received moderate airplay in Canada. Also that same year, Gowan was part of an all-star lineup at Toronto's Massey Hall to celebrate Ronnie Hawkins' 60th birthday, as documented on the album Let It Rock, sharing the stage with veteran rockers Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and The Band. In 1997, Gowan released two live CDs: Sololive - No Kilt Tonight containing a rendition of Ragtime's classic &quot;King Chanticleer Rag&quot;, and Au QuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bec with a cover of Harmonium's &quot;Pour un instant&quot; as well as his first composition in French, &quot;StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phanie&quot;, for his fan base in the province of Quebec.\n\nIn 1997, Gowan released &quot;Healing Waters&quot; as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales after her death. &quot;Healing Waters&quot; was officially an unreleased song from Gowan, though it was used, in its original form, in the 1995 Jeff Wincott movie, When the Bullet Hits the Bone.\n\nHis song &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot; was covered in 2005 by Canadian hip-hop artist Maestro; Gowan appears in the video and his vocals are sampled on the track. The song was also sampled in a song performed by Akon and Freck Billionaire.\n\nHe also guest-starred on the Canadian animated comedy series Chilly Beach.\n\nIn February 2006, Gowan did four orchestra-accompanied concerts in London, Ontario and Kitchener, Ontario. Also in 2006, his home was featured on MTV's Cribs.\n\nIn March 2010, Gowan released &quot;Return of the Strange Animal&quot;, a remastered version of 1985's &quot;Strange Animal&quot; plus a making-of documentary and music videos on DVD.[1] In May 2010, Gowan performed two solo shows in support of the 25th anniversary of the &quot;Strange Animal&quot; album.\n\nIn 1996 during Styx's &quot;Return to the Paradise Theatre&quot; tour, Gowan performed as a supporting act for Styx at Montreal's Molson Centre and Quebec City's ColisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e.\n\nTommy Shaw admired his talent and vibrant stage charisma, and called him in May 1999 asking him to tour with them for 53 dates, replacing their lead singer Dennis DeYoung. Since then, Gowan's classic hit, &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot;, is often played by Styx.\n\nDeYoung's absence proved a convenient opportunity for a more permanent restructuring of Styx ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which had long been plagued by differences in artistic inclination. Gowan subsequently became the band's permanent vocalist. He says &quot;I was in after the third gig&quot;.[citation needed]\n\nStyx's 2003 album Cyclorama was Gowan's first studio album with the band. Gowan sings two songs on Cyclorama, &quot;Fields of the Brave&quot; and &quot;More Love for the Money&quot;, both of which have an easily recognizable Gowan signature. He then continued recording with Styx for their 2005 album, Big Bang Theory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrange Animal 1985\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nCosmetics\nDesperate\nCity of The Angels\nWalking On Air\nBurning Torches Of Hope\nKeep The Tension On\nGuerilla Soldier\n(You're A) Strange Animal\nA Criminal Mind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLost Brotherhood 1990\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nAll The Lovers In The World\nLost Brotherhood\nCall It A Mission\nThe Dragon\nLove makes You Believe\nFire It Up\nOut Of Deeper Hunger\nTender Young Hero\nMessage from Heaven\nHolding This Rage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...But You Can Call Me Larry 1993\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nSoul's Road\nWhen There's Time (For Love)\nInnocent\nYour Stone Walls\nDancing On My Own Ground\nCry On My Shoulder\nMoonchild's Psychedelic Holiday\nYou Never Let Go\n(In The) Wild Summer Night\nLast Laugh\nLittle Face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Of 1997\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nA Criminal Mind \nYou're A Strange Animal \nGuerrilla Soldier \nCosmetics \nMoonlight Desires \nAwake The Giant \nAll The Lovers In The World \nLost Brotherhood \nOut Of A Deeper Hunger \nWhen There's Time For Love \nDancing On My Own Ground \nSoul's Road \nYour Stone Walls \nDedication\nThese Eyes (by Burton Cummings)\nHealing Waters...For Diana: Queen of Hearts\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31c954c79a84a47b1ea314b6b075878a418dbbc7","amp;dn":"Gowan+-+4+Albums+1985+-+1997+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31c954c79a84a47b1ea314b6b075878a418dbbc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,201,84,199,154,132,164,123,30,163,20,182,176,117,135,138,65,141,187,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
