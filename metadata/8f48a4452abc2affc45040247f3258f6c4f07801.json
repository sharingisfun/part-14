He tried to murder\nmy Father. Little did he know that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mess with my family?\n\nI will get my revenge. Then IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take down anyone else who stands\nin my way and I will make them pay. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not your average woman.\nI deal with thugs and murders. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been broken and tortured. But\ndonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mistake this for weakness. I am far from weak. I should be\nfeared and definitely not be messed with.\n\nI have a Greek God by my side. His name is Stefanos and he worships\nthe ground I walk on, and I adore him. He gives me the strength I\nneed for the path IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve chosen. People in my business know me as\nKrinos, and I am not to be trifled with.\n\n\nKalon (Take Over Series #2)\nBy: T.L.
