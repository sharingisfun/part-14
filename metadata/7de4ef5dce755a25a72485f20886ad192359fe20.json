Written by John Winslade and Gerald MonkÃ¢â‚¬â€leaders in the narrative therapy movementÃ¢â‚¬â€the book contains suggestions and illustrative examples for applying the proven narrative technique when working with restorative conferencing and mediation in organizations, schools, health care, divorce cases, employer and employee problems, and civil and international conflicts. Practicing Narrative Mediation also explores the most recent research available on discursive positioning and exposes the influence of the moment-to-moment factors that are playing out in conflict situations. The authors include new concepts derived from narrative family work such as &quot;absent but implicit,&quot; &quot;double listening,&quot; and &quot;outsider-witness practices.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7de4ef5dce755a25a72485f20886ad192359fe20","amp;dn":"Practicing+Narrative+Meditation+-Winslade%2FMonk-+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+PD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7de4ef5dce755a25a72485f20886ad192359fe20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,228,239,93,206,117,90,37,167,36,133,242,8,134,173,25,35,89,254,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
