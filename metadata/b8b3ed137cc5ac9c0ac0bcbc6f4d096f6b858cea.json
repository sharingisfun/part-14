Now the fate of an entire civilization rests on their shoulders.\n\nLong months of training and battle have brought victories and hope, but they have also brought heartbreaking loss. And still, the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chances.\n\nThe Rider and his dragon have come further than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to AlagaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sia? And if so, at what cost?\n\nThis is the much-anticipated, astonishing conclusion to the worldwide bestselling Inheritance cycle.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8b3ed137cc5ac9c0ac0bcbc6f4d096f6b858cea","amp;dn":"Inheritance-+Book+4+by+Christopher+Paolini+%28Audiobook%29+Unabridge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8b3ed137cc5ac9c0ac0bcbc6f4d096f6b858cea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,179,237,19,124,197,172,156,10,192,188,188,111,77,9,111,107,133,140,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
