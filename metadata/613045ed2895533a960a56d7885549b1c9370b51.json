My first since 2003. But this time with a part of my music that normally dont get the same presentation by me, or rather the music that I dont promote at all. I put together a best of dubmood PC-crackscene music 2004-2007. All thoose keygens, installers and cracktros that you have maybe seen, maybe not. Some in new forms, some remixed, some abit longer. And as if that aint nice enough, I threw in four never-heard-before bonus tracks.\n\nFor thoose of you who aint really sure what this means, I'm gonna write out the details. Its a 14 track long album with songs made in Fasttracker 2 by me, my personal favourites 2004-2007 so to say. The 4 bonus tracks is a live-concert interlude played once when I needed to change some gear on stage in the middle of the performance, one bizarre lost remix of a zabutom track I found on an old haddrive (I have tons of thoose around), one atari cover from a song called warp that I tracked from heart by how I rememberd it from a Flame of Finland crackintro I used to watch over and over and over as a kid and one bizarre song I made one late night with zabutom where we simply bounced a .xm file back and forth saying 10min and 4 patterns each.\n\nIts also included a nice dubmood-poster that my brother draw for me as a sort of -welcome home to cold dark sweden to spend the holidays in a +1c fog-rain brown mudbatch together with me and the family- gift. Thanks alot! Its a crappy scan of the poster for the moment but he promised to send me the digital file when he returns home so I'm going to update it in a couple of days. Sorry for that.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1194365&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1194365&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack listing\n1 NFL Cracktro 2006 Intro Film (1:32)\n2 Mario Airlines (Razor1911 Crysis-Keygen Edit) (4:45)\n3 17kr Sexpacket (Installer Edit) (1:28)\n4 Command &amp; Conqueror 3 Keygen (A Message To You Mowgli) (1:24)\n5 Keygen #13 (Razor 1911 Version) (1:59)\n6 Razor Comeback Intro (7:09)\nFeaturing - Zabutom\n7 WoTW The One And Only (3:39)\n8 Coke-Smuggling (5:46)\nFeaturing - Zabutom\n9 Cybernostra Weekends (Allied Assault Keygen) (5:51)\n10 Supersquatting (4:36)\nFeaturing - Zabutom\n11 Interlude BONUS (0:48)\n12 Robot Adventure (Dubmood Latenight 2004 Remix) BONUS (2:38)\n13 Warp-Intro From A FOF Crack (Dubmood Remix) BONUS (4:43)\n14 4 Patterns &amp; 10 Minutes Each!
