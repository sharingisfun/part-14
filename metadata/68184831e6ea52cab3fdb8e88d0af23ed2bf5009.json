The Israelis, according to \nthe Canaanite narrative, are from this place and belong only here; according to the crusader narrative, they are from another place and belong there. \nOn the one hand, the mythological construction of Zionism as a modern crusade describes Israel as a Western colonial enterprise planted in the heart of \nthe East and alien to the area, its logic, and its peoples, whose end must be degeneration and defeat. On the other hand, the nativist construction of \nIsrael as neo-Canaanism, which defined the nation in purely geographical terms as an imagined native community, demands breaking away from the chain of \nhistorical continuity. Those are the two greatest anxieties that Zionism and Israel needed to encounter and answer forcefully. The Origins of Israeli \nMythology seeks to examine the intellectual archaeology of Israeli mythology, as it reveals itself through the Canaanite and crusader narratives. \n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68184831e6ea52cab3fdb8e88d0af23ed2bf5009","amp;dn":"The+Origins+of+Israeli+Mythology-+Neither+Canaanites+Nor+Crusade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68184831e6ea52cab3fdb8e88d0af23ed2bf5009","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,24,72,49,230,234,82,202,179,253,184,232,141,10,242,62,210,191,80,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
