After multiple albums a band gets the perfect ingredients together to formulate the recipe for a successful album. At some point a band reaches a place where aggression and genius come together and making albums come easy. Caliban has returned with their 9th studio album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ghost EmpireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  With success at hand a band will usually lay out the blueprint to what got them there in the first place. Unfortunately, for most of these bands it means regurgitated versions of the same albums they have made for multiple years.\n\nOn Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ghost EmpireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Caliban does the opposite by bringing growth and change to their signature sound. The songs on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ghost EmpireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are well written and serve their purpose.  Stout like a punch to the face these heavyweight veterans bring it. Songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chaos-CreationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ prove the Caliban will not be slowing down. Evidence of this comes on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wolves and RatsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where grinding heaviness and powerful vocals of Andreas DÃƒÂ¶rner made me want to feed my eardrums more. Another track I enjoyed was, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cries and WhispersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song that puts Denis SchmidtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clean vocal and melodic guitar ability on display. Schmidt knows how to bring a raw and natural emotion that typical metalcore bands cannot achieve.  \n\nIn the end, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about making good music and being true to what got you there. This band has proven their strength on the road, a powerhouse in the studio and a commitment to making heavy music. Give Caliban the chance to show you what a veteran band sounds like. Pick up Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ghost EmpireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where music is sold.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d13e6f6c913636c64a1e0febc2edb21c8f7f479","amp;dn":"Caliban+-+Ghost+Empire+%28320CBR%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d13e6f6c913636c64a1e0febc2edb21c8f7f479","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,19,230,246,201,19,99,108,100,161,224,254,188,46,219,33,200,247,244,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
