It'll ask for a directory to extract to.  Copy over all the files that are there from the demo.\n\n-Run the register.reg - this will put the info into the registry saying that all deskmates are registered. \nYou can do this by doubleclicking on it and pressing yes in the following window.\n\n-You can start any of the deskmates by going to the c:program filesdeskmates directory, going into a directory (example: tahni3d) and execute the exe in that directory (example: tahni3d.exe)\n\n-Optional: Make shortcuts\n\n\nNB:\nI got these off of the Emule network, I've been after them for years basically, finally found where to get them.\nAll files compressed and extracted have been scanned for viruses using FreeAV.\nWorks for me - touch zones and all ;)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e28c13a51ab36bcbdc0cc036e22557c68107bc13","amp;dn":"Deskmates+Dancers+Johlee+Kahli+Maeka+Sugar+N+Spice+Tahni+Tahni3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e28c13a51ab36bcbdc0cc036e22557c68107bc13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,140,19,165,26,179,107,203,220,12,192,54,226,37,87,198,129,7,188,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
