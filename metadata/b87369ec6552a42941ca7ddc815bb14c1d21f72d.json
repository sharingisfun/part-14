New York Times best-seller Catherynne M. Valente is the single most compelling voice to emerge in fantasy fiction in decades. Collected here for the first time, her early short novels explore, deconstruct, and ultimately explode the seminal myths of both East and West, casting them in ways you've never read before and may never read again.\n\nThe Labyrinth - a woman wanderer, a Maze like no other, a Monkey and a Minotaur and a world full of secrets leading down to the Center of it All.\n\nYume No Hon: The Book of Dreams - an aged woman named Ayako lives in medieval Japan, but dreams in mythical worlds that beggar the imagination . . . including our own modern world.\n\nThe Grass-Cutting Sword - when a hero challenges a great and evil serpent, who speaks for the snake? In this version of a myth from the ancient chronicle Kojiki, the serpent speaks for himself.\n\nUnder in the Mere - Arthur and Lancelot, Mordred and le Fay. The saga has been told a thousand times, but never in the poetic polyphony of this novella, a story far deeper than it is long.\nGenre: Fantasy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b87369ec6552a42941ca7ddc815bb14c1d21f72d","amp;dn":"Myths+of+Origin+-+Catherynne+M.+Valente.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b87369ec6552a42941ca7ddc815bb14c1d21f72d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,115,105,236,101,82,164,41,65,202,125,220,129,91,177,76,29,33,247,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
