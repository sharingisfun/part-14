Stine, New York Times bestselling author of the Goosebumps and Fear Street seriesÃ¢â‚¬â€the biggest selling childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books of all timeÃ¢â‚¬â€delivers a terrifying new adult horror novel centered on a town in the grip of a sinister revolt.\n\nBefore there was J.K. Rowling, before there was Stephenie Meyer or Suzanne Collins, there was R.L. Stine. Witty, creepy, and compulsively readable, he defined horror for a generation of young readersÃ¢â‚¬â€readers who have now come of age.\n\nTravel writer Lea Sutter finds herself on a small island off the coast of South Carolina, the wrong place at the wrong time. A merciless, unanticipated hurricane cuts a path of destruction and Lea barely escapes with her life. In the stormÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aftermath, she discovers orphaned twin boys and impulsively decides to adopt them. The boys, Samuel and Daniel, seem amiable and immensely grateful; LeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family back on Long IslandÃ¢â‚¬â€husband Mark and their two children, Ira and ElenaÃ¢â‚¬â€arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite so pleased. But even they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t anticipate the twinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ true natureÃ¢â‚¬â€or predict that, within a few weeksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ time, Mark will wind up implicated in two brutal murders, with the police narrowing in.\n\nFor the millions of readers who grew up on Goosebumps, and for every fan of deviously inventive horror, this is a must-read from a beloved master of the genre.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:671cbfa98519b10261361d015ee2302058deb157","amp;dn":"Red+Rain+by+R.L.+Stine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"671cbfa98519b10261361d015ee2302058deb157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,28,191,169,133,25,177,2,97,54,29,1,94,226,48,32,88,222,177,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
