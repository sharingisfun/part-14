The final comic series was based on the initial screenplay, with some revision made by Kirby.\n\nThe series was launched following the success of Kirby's previous creator-owned book for Pacific, Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers.  Silver Star follows the exploits of government agent Morgan Miller, who, after being transformed into a genetic mutant (Homo Geneticus) by his father Dr. Bradford Miller, was appointed the task of fighting other super powered beings.  Silver Star teams with fellow Homo Geneticus, Norma Richmond (gifted with the ability to resist enormous stress,) and Big Masai (a size changing mutant,) and battles with the villainous Darius Drumm (an early subject of Dr. Bradford Miller's genetic structuring with the ability to warp reality.)\n\nThe books also included additional back-up stories not featuring the Silver Star.  For example, issue two included a short story by Steve Ditko, The Mocker.\n\nIn 1993 Topps Comics launched a new Silver Star as a part of the failed &quot;Kirbyverse&quot; books.  The series, written by Kurt Busiek with art by James W. Fry III and Terry Austin, only lasted one issue.\n\nIn November, 2011 Dynamite Entertainment released the single-issue series (initially slated to be four) Kirby Genesis:  Silver Star, written by Jai Nitz and drawn by Johnny D, featuring covers by Alex Ross, Jae Lee, and Mark Buckingham.\n\nALL issues mentioned are included in this torrent for your downloading/perusing pleasures.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3d95577beca9736bc6eee5b95bd176c092ca027","amp;dn":"Silver+Star+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3d95577beca9736bc6eee5b95bd176c092ca027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,217,85,119,190,202,151,54,188,110,238,91,149,189,23,108,9,44,160,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
