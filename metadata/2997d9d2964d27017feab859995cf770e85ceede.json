The result is an up-to-date survey of current challenges and opportunities in the design and operation of bioreactors for high-value products in the biomedical and chemical industries.\r\nCombining theory and practice, the authors explain such leading-edge technologies as single-use bioreactors, bioreactor simulators, and soft sensor monitoring, and discuss novel applications, such as stem cell production, process development, and multi-product reactors, using case studies from academia as well as from industry. A final section addresses the latest trends, including culture media design and systems biotechnology, which are expected to have an increasing impact on bioreactor design.\r\nWith its focus on cutting-edge technologies and discussions of future developments, this handbook will remain an invaluable reference for many years to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2997d9d2964d27017feab859995cf770e85ceede","amp;dn":"Bioreactors+-+Design%2C+Operation+and+Novel+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2997d9d2964d27017feab859995cf770e85ceede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,151,217,210,150,77,39,1,127,234,184,89,153,92,247,112,232,92,238,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
