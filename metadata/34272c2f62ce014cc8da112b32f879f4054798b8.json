The concepts of net force and statics are also illustrated. Segment length: 45 minutes\n\n    Newton's 2nd Law: The relationship of force, acceleration, and mass is illustrated with a variety of examples. The effects of friction on motion are shown using both sliding and falling objects. Segment length: 42 minutes\n\n    Newton's 3rd Law: The notion that a force is a push or a pull is developed. The concept that forces always occur in pairs as interactions between one thing and another is supported with numerous examples, including a tug-of-war. Segment length: 43 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34272c2f62ce014cc8da112b32f879f4054798b8","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Physics+Alive+Volume+2%3A+Newton%27s+Laws+-+Paul+Hewitt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34272c2f62ce014cc8da112b32f879f4054798b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,39,44,47,98,206,1,76,200,218,17,43,50,248,121,244,5,71,152,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
