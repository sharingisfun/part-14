Much of the charm and grandeur of the ancient native civilizations survived until the devastation of the Vietnam War.\n\nLewis could still meet a King of Cambodia and an Emperor of Vietnam; in the hills he could stay in the spectacular longhouses of the highlanders; on the plains he could be enchanted by a people whom he found gentle, tolerant and dedicated to the pleasures and satisfactions of a discriminating kind.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1287676.A_Dragon_Apparent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1287676.A_Dragon_Apparent&lt;/a&gt; - 4.0\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1258c23fa2a718dd1b0597f88ce03c4e4c44fe7b","amp;dn":"Norman+Lewis+-+A+Dragon+Apparent.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1258c23fa2a718dd1b0597f88ce03c4e4c44fe7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,88,194,63,162,167,24,221,27,5,151,248,140,224,60,78,76,68,254,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
