A social services investigator calls\n                on elderly eccentrics William and Mary Bingham, but\n                he is sent away rudely by their daughter Selina and\n                her husband Eddie Stanton. Artist Maggie Viviani also\n                had a run-in with the investigator, so when his body\n                is found in the river, they all come under suspicion.\n                Barnaby learns that the Binghams never recovered from\n                losing their elder daughter and son in a drowning\n                accident, and discovers that the daughter's body was\n                never found. Then Mary is discovered dead. Could a\n                mysterious reference to a moon crater called Bingham\n                hold a clue?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca352ddc55517f4a295cecf0427a69df9921554a","amp;dn":"Midsomer.Murders.S14E02.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca352ddc55517f4a295cecf0427a69df9921554a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,53,45,220,85,81,127,74,41,92,236,240,66,122,105,223,153,33,85,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
