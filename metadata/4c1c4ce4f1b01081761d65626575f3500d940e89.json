Though competing with Mark Waid's famous run on the main title, RAS managed to craft his own compelling story - exploring the familiar themes and dynamics of family while also showing FF stalwarts like Namor in a new light. Though cancelled after issue 30, RAS managed to complete a pretty good run, although it seems now it is very difficult to find this anywhere. At least now this torrent rectifies that problem! ;-)\n\nThanks to all the scanners (including Team DCP) and original uploaders, and of course please seed. Enjoy! :-) \n\nThis fills a request for AlternityTom. Also, for me personally, ha!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c1c4ce4f1b01081761d65626575f3500d940e89","amp;dn":"Marvel+Knights+4+01-30+%5BFantastic+Four%5D+%282004-2006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c1c4ce4f1b01081761d65626575f3500d940e89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,28,76,228,241,176,16,129,118,29,101,98,101,117,243,80,13,148,14,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
