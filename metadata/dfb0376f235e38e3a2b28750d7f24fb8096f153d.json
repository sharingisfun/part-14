This geographical area is the same as\nthe 'Gen-X' VFR photographic ground scenery released by Horizon simulation software. Although designed to fit in to\n'Gen-X', users do NOT need this to use this product, how ever I would recommend it for the ultimate visual experience.\n\nEach airfields is made to a high standard with photo real textures in many places. A lot of the airfields are totally new,\nbut some parts are imported from previous work but updated in many ways. Designed specially for FSX, the scenery uses\na lot of the FSX objects and effects, like moving road traffic, flying birds and conventional 'AFD' taxiways and runways.\nThe scenery is compatible with FSX SP1, Acceleration and SP2 variants.\n\nXXX.uk2000scenery.com/vfrairfields/My_Homepage_Files/Page18.html\n\nAt last its here,Enjoy :+)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfb0376f235e38e3a2b28750d7f24fb8096f153d","amp;dn":"FSX-UK2000-VFR-Airfields-Vol-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfb0376f235e38e3a2b28750d7f24fb8096f153d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,176,55,111,35,94,56,227,162,178,135,80,215,242,79,184,9,111,21,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
