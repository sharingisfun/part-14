She withdrew from music business in 2009...\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_K.)\n\nReviews:\n\n&quot;...a rare find, recorded in 1994 in Queens, NY, incredible ensemble of players accompany Sara's voice and 4 string guitar on this live to disc recording. Many special moments and original takes of some of her best-known songs and vocal techniques. This CD is a must for the Sara K. collection.&quot;\n(CD Universe)\n\n&quot;...wonderful vocals, sparse backings and enough atmosphere to justify a film of the album...&quot;\n(Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review)\n\n&quot;...what you want is something peaceful, yet emotionally invigorating...&quot;\n(The Audio Adventure)\n\n&quot;The Santa Fe singer/songwriter sends out lyrical tendrils that attach themselves to the listener so an exchange of emotions can take place...&quot;\n(CD Review, Women in Music)\n\n&quot;...intimate folk in an austere acoustic setting...With the sparest backdrop of guitar, bass, and light percussion, Sara's vignettes are personal and romantic, spun from a calm center that can only house those with the sense to find it...Thanks to the flawless production, Sara sounds as if she's playing right in your living room.&quot;\n(Alan Orski, New Review, Summer 1996) \n\n&quot;...at once romantic and warm, as well as lyrically chilling and stark. As always, her &quot;sound&quot; is wholly her own - a distinctly hushed and warm tone fingering a flamenco guitar strung with low end strings. File Sara K. under vocal folk jazz with panache.&quot;\n(Alex Boyd, Leak, Winter/Spring)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e46bbd69895414b9e579e53f9229ebc47c2c5b1","amp;dn":"Sara+K.+-+1994+-+Play+On+Words","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e46bbd69895414b9e579e53f9229ebc47c2c5b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,70,187,214,152,149,65,75,158,87,158,83,249,34,158,188,71,194,197,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
