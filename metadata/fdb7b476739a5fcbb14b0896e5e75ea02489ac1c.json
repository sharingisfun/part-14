It revolves around a massively popular MMO (this was pre-World of Warcraft, keep in mind) known as The World that has the ability to give birth to artificial intelligence and affect the minds of players. It\\'s massively complicated and self-referential, and I\\'ve done my best to put everything in one torrent. So without further ado, this\\'ll be a synopsis of what you\\'re looking at. It\\'s not necessary to play/watch/read all of it, but it gives the most effect. Play/watch/read it in order.\n\nProject .hack : The original .hack series.\n1) .hack//AI BUSTER - Novel - This is the first chronological event in the .hack timeline. It\\'s about a player in the beta release of The World that meets an NPC that wasn\\'t implemented by the system administrators. It turns out she\\'s an artificial intelligence created by the game, and another AI wants her dead.\n2) .hack//SIGN - Anime, 26 episodes - In the proper release of The World, we meet Tsukasa, a boy that loves him some MMOS until one day, he realizes he can\\'t log out. Furthermore, the game seems to have become his reality! Despite being an antisocial fuckwit, he makes a couple friends and becomes wrapped up in a conspiracy that threatens to destroy The World. Also, lesbians.\n3) .hack//INTERMEZZO - Anime, 1 episode - Once Tsukasa\\'s story ends, Mimiru and Bear go to an event dungeon and she talks about her first adventure in The World.\n4a) .hack//IMOQ - PS2 -  Infection, Mutation, Outbreak, and Quarantine. The first game in the series. You play a kid named Kite, whose best friend, Orca, is famous in The World. Things go horribly wrong though, when a monster kills Orca, leading his real-life counterpart to fall into a coma. Kite starts his own investigation into The World\\'s secrets.\n4b) .hack//ANOTHER BIRTH - Novels - The same story as the games, told from BlackRose\\'s point of view. You can read this instead of playing the games, or both.\n5) .hack//LIMINALITY - Anime, 4 episodes - Concurrent to the events of the .hack games, a programmer that made The World tries to save the coma victims. This was a pack-in with the .hack games. Watch one episode after you beat each game for the ideal effect.\n6a) .hack//UNISON - Anime, 1 episode - Helba invites the cast of .hack//SIGN and .hack//IMOQ to hang out. Wackiness ensues.\n6b) .hack//GIFT - Anime, 1 episode - Helba invites the cast of .hack//SIGN and .hack//IMOQ to hang out. Wackiness ensues. This is a different story from Unison, kind of a parody.\n7a) .hack//LEGEND OF THE TWILIGHT - Manga - Twins Rena and Shugo play The World using PCs based on the legendary players Kite and BlackRose. Little do they know that they are about to be a part of the same mystery as the legendary players themselves, as Aura entrusts the Twilight Bracelet to Shugo. DUN DUN DUNN!\n7b) .hack//LEGEND OF THE TWILIGHT - Anime, 12 episodes - Non-canon. Not very good, but sort of cute. The story differs after episode four.\n8) .hack//AI BUSTER 2 - Novel, Chapter 5 - The first three chapters continue Albeiro\\'s story and tie into the events of .hack//SIGN. The fourth chapter is about Rena\\'s first character, and the last chapter is about Hotaru\\'s first time on The World\\'s Japanese servers.\n9) .hack//FRAGMENT - PS2 - Don\\'t play this. Seriously, it\\'s awful. it\\'s supposed to be sort of a real-life version of The World, but it\\'s just terrible. The servers are down these days and you get a better .hack experience from playing the proper games. It\\'s only in here for completion\\'s sake. If you read moonrunes it might be of slight interest, but I doubt it.\n\n.hack Conglomerate : The sequel series, which began in 2007. The World is shut down, a sequel comes out, and some idiot restarts all of this crazy stuff. Dumbass.\n1) .hack//ROOTS - Anime, 26 episodes - A player named Haseo starts playing The World R:2 after he had a bad experience with The World R:1. Two rival guilds suddenly want him to join for no real reason. He picks one, and drama ensues.\n2a) .hack//G.U. - PS2 - Haseo\\'s story continues from .hack//ROOTS. Tri-Edge data drains him and fucks with his memories. Shit gets crazy pretty much immediately.\n2b) .hack//G.U. Trilogy - Movie - A movie version of the PS2 games.\n3) Terminal Disc: End of The World: A recap of Project .hack and an explanation of what the hell happened in between the games and Conglomerate, as well as explaining some \\&quot;lolwut\\&quot; moments from the game\\'s story. It\\'s a PS2 game and you\\'re supposed to only be able to use it once you\\'ve completed all three .hack//G.U. games, but you can also mount it on your PC and watch them through most Media Player programs.\n4) .hack//RETURNER - Same as .hack//UNISON. A crossover between .hack//ROOTS and .hack//G.U.\n.hack//G.U. Trilogy Parody Mode - A pre-order bonus for the .hack//G.U. Trilogy DVD in Japan. Clips from the movie reassembled as silly sketches. Has some spoilers, so watch the movie or play the games first.\n\n.hack//FINALE : The last series.\n1a) .hack//LINK - PSP - The \\&quot;grand\\&quot; finale. JP only, though some guys at dothackers are trying to translate it. The World\\'s final version, R:X, goes out of control as usual. Some kid named Tokio gets transported into The World, rather than just having his mind stuck in it. Features basically every .hack character in both series through time travel somehow.\n2) .hack//QUANTUM - Anime, 3 episodes - Takes place during the World R:X, around the same time as .hack//LINK. Some kids that looks like Kite, BlackRose, and Balmung play The World. Comas and viruses ensue.\n\nAlso included are the soundtracks for everything.
