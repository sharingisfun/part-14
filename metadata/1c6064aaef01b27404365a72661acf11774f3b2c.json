Some of them are very good. Most of them cost money, and the vast majority of computer science undergraduate students will shell out at least some cash on a data structures book. Several free data structures books are available online. Some are very good, but most of them are getting old. The majority of these books became free when their authors and/or publishers decided to stop updating them. Updating these books is usually not possible, for two reasons:\n\n(1) The copyright belongs to the author and/or publisher, either of whom may not allow it.\n(2) The source code for these books is often not available. That is, the Word, WordPerfect, FrameMaker, or LE the book is not available, and even the version of the software that handles this source may not be available.\nThe goal of this project is to free undergraduate computer science students from having to pay for an introductory data structures book. I have decided to implement this goal by treating this book like an Open Source AT X source, Java source, and build scripts for the software project. The LE book are available to download from the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website1 and also, more importantly, on a reliable source code management site.2 This source code is released under a Creative Commons Attribution\nlicense, meaning that anyone is free to share: to copy, distribute and transmit the work; and to remix: to adapt the work, including the right to make commercial use of the work.
