In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, thereâ€™s only one thing on young Tommyâ€™s football-mad mind â€“ the forthcoming World Cup, where tiny Northern Ireland will take on the mighty Brazil. For the South American giants itâ€™s just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, itâ€™s the biggest game of their lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:187e1fb8d341da2fc8563a74fce881e8b4e71a90","amp;dn":"Shooting+for+Socrates+%282014%29+DVDRip+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"187e1fb8d341da2fc8563a74fce881e8b4e71a90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,126,31,184,211,65,218,47,200,86,58,116,252,232,129,232,180,231,26,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
