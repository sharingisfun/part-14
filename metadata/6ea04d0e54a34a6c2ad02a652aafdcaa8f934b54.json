Yet no matter what they try, they are unable to find true (or lasting) relief. They are dismissed by doctor after doctor without a definitive diagnosisÃ¢â‚¬â€told that their symptoms are either in their heads or just an expected part of the aging process. But Dr. Kathy Maupin knows that this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t true.\nAs one of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading experts on hormonal balanceÃ¢â‚¬â€and as a woman who experienced these symptoms herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€Dr. Maupin has identified a debilitating and largely unknown health condition that is affecting millions of women: testosterone deficiency. While most people associate testosterone with men, it's one of the most vital hormones in women, and one of the first hormones that women begin to lose as they enter their 40s. Dr. MaupinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own research has shown that the symptoms of aging are initiated and accelerated by testosterone loss.\nThe bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highlights include:\nÃ‚Â· Tips for dealing with mood swings, changes in sex drive, and maintaining healthy relationships\nÃ‚Â· Surprising information on the long-term effects and health risks of testosterone loss\nÃ‚Â· Common myths and misconceptions regarding estrogen and testosterone replacement therapy\nÃ‚Â· Questionnaires throughout to help readers determine their individual hormone deficiencies\nReal stories and\nÃ‚Â· personal experiences Dr. MaupinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patients share\nIn The Secret Female Hormone, Dr. Maupin and therapist Brett Newcomb bring vital information about testosterone to the general public for the first time as they share the latest research on testosterone replacement therapy for women and its effects. Speaking in clear and practical terms, they show readers how to find the right treatment plan for their individual needs. This authoritative guide is bound to be a bible for women everywhere in their quest to understand the importance of testosterone in their own lives, so they can reclaim their physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ea04d0e54a34a6c2ad02a652aafdcaa8f934b54","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Female+Hormone+-+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ea04d0e54a34a6c2ad02a652aafdcaa8f934b54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,160,77,14,84,163,74,108,42,208,42,101,42,175,220,170,143,147,75,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
