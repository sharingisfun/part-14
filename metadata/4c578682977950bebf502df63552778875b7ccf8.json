But nanotechnology has been declared illegal by the home planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leaders, and a powerful despot is determined to lay claim to StavengerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peaceful city - or obliterate it, if necessary. The people of Moonbase, a colony with no arms or military, must now defend themselves from earthborn aggression with the only weapon at their disposal: the astonishing technology that sustains their endangered home.\n\nAbout the author: Ben Bova, six-time winner of the Hugo Award, is the author of over one hundred futuristic novels and nonfiction books.
