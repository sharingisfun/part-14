Critics raved about it, calling it one of the best TV shows in years. The writing, direction, and acting were all very good.\nThe New York Daily news called Jim Profit &quot;the most unremittingly evil character ever to serve as the protagonist and principal voice on a network TV series.&quot;  But most other viewers felt otherwise.  Ratings dipped dramatically during the two-hour pilot, and after three more episodes, Fox pulled the plug.  It's a shame, because the show was amazing while it lasted and was headed into juicier territory.  For a long time, the show epitomized the label &quot;Brilliant but Canceled&quot; (coined by the Trio network), and in 2005, Anchor Bay released the complete series on DVD.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAbout the series\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n&quot;Imagine the ocean is full of dolphins. And Profit is a new kind of shark that looks just like a dolphin. He could manuever among the dolphins and the dolphins would say 'Welcome!' in dolphin talk. And then, one night, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d start eating them.&quot;\n\n  - PROFIT co-creator John McNamara\n\n\nPROFIT follows the corporate skullduggery of junior V.P. Jim Profit - a full-blown sociopath. The series was well ahead of its time, with a singular draw: a lead character with no redeeming qualities at all. Profit was a study in duality: the charismatic co-worker and friend who lent an eager ear to others' troubles, and the cold pragmatist who would seduce his friend's wife and get his boss sent to prison.  Jim did anything not only to advance, but also raise himself from squalid circumstances.\n\nSure, today we have Dexter and Sopranos, but their characters still have some qualities a non-pathological person can relate to. Profit, however, doesn't, and yet he glues viewers to the screen.\nJim Profit wasn't the first popular champion of greed on TV.  After all, the '80s gave us Dallas' J.R. Ewing and Dynasty's Blake Carrington and Alexis Colby.  But Profit was the first time the bad guy was front and center.\n\nOften, Jim Profit broke the fourth wall and shared his plans and insights with the audience, as inspired by Richard III.  Just as often, something would go wrong, requiring Jim's sharp mind to work fast in finding a way out.  Where J.R. and Alexis were characters viewers loved to hate, here was a bad guy viewers could somehow get behind.  Profit lied to and cheated everyone, yet he was always honest about himself and his world with the audience.\n\n\n&quot;I don't see him as an amoral or immoral individual. I think he had a superior set of moral values that enabled him to act with relative impunity.&quot;\n\n  - Adrian Pasdar, &quot;Jim Profit&quot;\n\n\nConservative American viewers hated PROFIT. Fox cancelled the show after the pilot and four episodes. Reasons given by director and cast for the cancellation was that Fox had neither the &quot;patience&quot; nor &quot;testicular fortitude&quot; to give the show ample opportunity to find its market.\n\n\nPROFIT was also acclaimed to be &quot;five or eight years ahead of its time&quot; back in 1996. This was in part correct because TV audiences had not yet been conditioned by The Sopranos to empathize with blatant anti-heroes.\n\n\nOf course, the 21st century television landscape is littered with gangsters, corrupt cops, narcissists and killers as leads, from Tony Soprano to Vic Mackey, Christian Troy to Dexter Morgan.  I like to think they owe a huge debt to Jim Profit, who showed us that on television, it really is okay to cheer for the bad guy.\n\n\n\n                                     * * *\n\n\n\nThis torrent includes:\n\n\n- all 8 episodes, including those never aired\n- commentary tracks to three episodes\n- a documentary 'Greed Kills' about making the series\n\n\nIf you are looking for it, you know what it is.\nIf you are not looking for it, it means you should learn what it is.\n\n\nEnjoy,\nimpact0r","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd88d14eaf705e960b974add2463d61ce02ca37c","amp;dn":"Profit+-+Jim+Profit%2C+with+Extras+-+DVDRip+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd88d14eaf705e960b974add2463d61ce02ca37c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,136,209,78,175,112,94,150,11,151,74,221,36,99,214,28,224,44,163,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
