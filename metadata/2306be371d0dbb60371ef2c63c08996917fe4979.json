The Band, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album, was a more deliberate and even more accomplished effort, partially because the players had become a more cohesive unit, and partially because guitarist Robbie Robertson had taken over the songwriting, writing or co-writing all 12 songs. Though a Canadian, Robertson focused on a series of American archetypes from the union worker in Ã¢â‚¬Å“King Harvest (Has Surely Come)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the retired sailor in Ã¢â‚¬Å“RockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ChairÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to, most famously, the Confederate Civil War observer Virgil Cane in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The album effectively mixed the kind of mournful songs that had dominated Music from Big Pink, here including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whispering PinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“When You AwakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (both co-written by Richard Manuel), with rollicking uptempo numbers like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rag Mama RagÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Up on Cripple CreekÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (both sung by Levon Helm and released as singles, with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Up on Cripple CreekÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ making the Top 40). As had been true of the first album, it was The BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound that stood out the most, from HelmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (and occasionally ManuelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s) propulsive drumming to RobertsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinctive guitar fills and the endlessly inventive keyboard textures of Garth Hudson, all topped by the rough, expressive singing of Manuel, Helm, and Rick Danko that mixed leads with harmonies. The arrangements were simultaneously loose and assured, giving the songs a timeless appeal, while the lyrics continued to paint portraits of 19th century rural life (especially Southern life, as references to Tennessee and Virginia made clear), its sometimes less savory aspects treated with warmth and humor.\n\nMastered on our world-renowned mastering system, this collectable hybrid SACD burrows into the sonic heart of hearth-rich fare that balances AppalachiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mountain flavors, the Old WestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rollicking free spiritedness, CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s limitless vast folk sprawl, and the Deep SouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whiskey-soaked drawl. Arkansas native Richard Helm blends his rural roots with guitarist Robbie RobertsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s allegorical narratives, the pair meeting at a crossroads that, on this pressing, reveals textures as organic as cotton and tonalities as timeless as the look of classic filmstrips. Notes hover and naturally decay; cascading harmonies waft and reverberate; soundstages open up and extend, providing generous spaces for each memberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s invaluable contributions to relax, settle, and enter into a wholesome communion.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2306be371d0dbb60371ef2c63c08996917fe4979","amp;dn":"The+Band+-+The+Band+MFSL+%282013%29+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2306be371d0dbb60371ef2c63c08996917fe4979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,6,190,55,29,13,187,96,55,30,242,198,60,8,153,105,23,254,73,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
