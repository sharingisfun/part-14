Unfortunately, political conditions forced Reed out of Berlin before shooting wrapped, compelling him to complete the picture in the studio. Even so, the story of East Berliner Ivo Kern (Mason) who rescues Susanne Mallison (Claire Bloom), a British woman trapped in the Soviet Zone, is a minor masterpiece of suspense. Despite great danger to himself, Kern takes it upon himself to escort Mallison back to her family in West Berlin. After a daring dash through the countryside, the seeming impossible is achieved--but only through a conspicuous act of self sacrifice. Never completely satisfied with The Man Between, Carol Reed grudgingly admitted &quot;It made back its money.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046031/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046031/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExtra  subtitles: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-46031/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-46031/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nCarol Reed\n\n        James Mason\t ... \tIvo Kern\n\tClaire Bloom\t... \tSusanne Mallison\n\tHildegard Knef\t... \tBettina Mallison (as Hildegarde Neff)\n\tGeoffrey Toone\t... \tMartin Mallison\n\tAribert WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤scher\t... \tHalendar (as Aribert Waescher)\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:37:31\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 608x368\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 877 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,16 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nEnjoy!
