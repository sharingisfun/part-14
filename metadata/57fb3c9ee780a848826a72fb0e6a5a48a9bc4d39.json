It reports to the \ntracker that it's uploading (or downloading or both, it's your choice) at a certain \nrate, thus making it useful for artificially increasing your ratio on certain sites \nthat track a user's overall ratio (total uploaded/total downloaded).\nRatioMaster has hardcoded emulations for the most commonly used BitTorrent clients, \nbut it is also able to parse external files for emulation settings, thus making it easily\nextensible for your favorite client and easy to update when new versions of said clients\nare released. The client files (extension &quot;.client&quot;) are actually renamed XML files and \nthe syntax should be pretty straight-forward. The emulation layer includes support for \nparameter order in GETs, reproduction of HTTP headers, generation of application-specific\npeer_ids and keys and more. RatioMaster can also parse the tracker reannounce time from \nthe tracker's HTTP response, and combined with the fact that you can specify down and \nup rates makes it pretty hard to detect by any anti-cheat scripts, if not downright \nimpossible. Other features, like a TCP listener (so as to appear connectable on the \ntracker's peerlist) and a leecher counter (so as to stop any uploads when a torrent \nhas 0 leechers) also contribute to RatioMaster's spoofing abilities.\n\nMemory Reader\n--------------------\nStarting from version 1.6 RatioMaster have integrated Memory Reader tool that usefull \nwhen you want to read exact Peer ID, Key, Port and Number of peers announce parameters\nfrom your regular torrent client (like uTorrent,Azureus,Bitcomet or others). Look for\nthe 'Memory Reader' button in Advanced Tab.\n\nCommand Line support \n---------------------\nStarting from version 1.7 RatioMaster supports command line options.This feature is useful\nif you want to run several torrents from batch file or shortcuts with predefined setting:\nPossible keys : \n   /minimize - RM will start minimized to tray.\n   /start - RM will load latest torrent (or the one provided in command line) and\nautomatically start it\n   /downloadRate, /uploadRate - RM will set download and upload speed \n   /percent - RM will set finished percent (0% = start leeching, 100% = seeding)\n   /hide  - RM will start in hidden mode, minimized and no tray icon .Use at your own\nrisk, as far as i know the only way to stop it, is to kill process in Task Manager.\n\nExamplesis a full path to the torrent file) : \n\n   ratiomaster.exe\n - will load the torrent\n   ratiomaster.exe/start\n - will load the torrent from torrentpath and run it with default options\n   ratiomaster.exe/start /uploadRate:250 /downloadRate:200 /percent:100\n - will load the torrent and start it with 250 upload,200 download,and finished 100%\n   ratiomaster.exe /uploadRate:250\n - will set provided value,all others will be default from settings\n   ratiomaster.exe /minimized /start\n - will start ratiomaster in minimized mode with last loaded torrent.\n\nSaving individual torrent settings \n----------------------------------\nStarting from version 1.7 RatioMaster saves individual settings for each torrent and uses\nthose settings next time that you are loading same torrent. \nSetting files are stored in '/Torrents Config' subfolder of the ratiomaster.exe folder.\n\nLocalization support\n----------------------------------\nStarting from version 1.8 Ratiomaster supports different languages by using text unicode files.\nThose files are stored in /lng subfolder of the ratiomaster.exe folder and should have an extension 'lng'.\nUsers are encouraged to create their own translations using english.lng as a template.\n\n\n\n\t*** Contact ***\nWebsite: http://www.moofdev.net/\nForums: http://www.moofdev.net/forums/\nEmail: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;592b382d303634382a2d3c2b06696f192038313636773a3634&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n\n\n\t*** Requirements ***\n\nRatioMaster requires that you've got the .NET Framework version 2 installed. \nYou can get it from Microsoft: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://download.microsoft.com/download/5/6/7/567758a3-759e-473e-bf8f-52154438565a/dotnetfx.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://download.microsoft.com/download/5/6/7/567758a3-759e-473e-bf8f-52154438565a/dotnetfx.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\t*** How to use ***\n\n1. Get a .torrent file associated with the tracker you want to spoof.\n2. Load or Drag/Drop that file into RatioMaster.\n3. Change the settings in the Options group to your liking: upload speed,\ndownload speed (set to 0 to spoof upload only), finished (how much of the file do you \nwant to appear that you have - set to 100% if you want to appear as a seeder) \n4. Choose 'Client Simulation' in Advanced Tab to be the same type as your regular torrent client. \n5. Optionally, look through the Advanced and Network tabs and see if you need anything \nchanged there, like using a specific port or announcing through a proxy server. \nMost users won't need to change anything here.\n6. Press the Start button and watch the bytes start rolling.\n7. After a while, when you decide you've spoofed enough, press the Stop button to announce\nto the tracker that you're ending your session.\n\n\n\t*** Things to remember ***\n\t\n\t\nFirst of all, don't use very high upload speeds. Some trackers check sessions for very big\nupload rates. Using a 6 MB/s upload rate when your IP belongs to an ISP who only has a 512\nkbps plan is plain stupid. Check the moofdev forums on more info on maximum safe speeds \nreached by other users on different trackers.\nNever spoof uploads on a tracker with few peers. If there are only 2 leechers and they're\ndownloading at a maximum of 300 kB/s, and you're spoofing an upload of 2 MB/s, it will \nlook suspicious.\nKeep the software up-to-date. Sometimes bugs are found that may get you banned on sites. \nRatioMaster includes an automatic version checker and will notify you when a new version \nis released. Update!\nIf you're going to take part in discussions on the moofdev forums, or other forums that \ndeal with this sort of software, don't use the same username you use on trackers. \nWe've had instances of tracker admins visiting the forums to see whether any of our users\nwere members on their trackers and... well, you can assume what happened next.\nRead the forums. Sometimes users will report that a certain tracker simply cannot be \nfooled. It's better to stay informed than be banned on your favourite tracker.\nLast, but not least, only spoof when you NEED to. By cheating on a torrent, \nyou're disrupting the swarm and going against the spirit of p2p. \nUnless you really need to increase your ratio and there's no better way (short of paying \nmoney - pay2leech trackers are a lot worse than cheating peers), don't cheat.\n\n\n\n\t*** Copyrights and acknowledgements ***\n\t\n\nRatioMaster (the software) was written by RatioMaster_06 (the person), with contributions\nby JTS-UD (yes it's an acronym!).\nWe'd like to also thank:\n\n\t* 12345B for moderating our forums, finding important bugs in beta builds,fixing\n\t  my syntax errors and typos and for being a nice guy :)\n\t* our anonymous betatester, who intensively tested every beta, came up with ideas \n\t  and also made some nice icons for us\n\t* Azurine, Samson and Thunder for beta testing and bug reports\n\t* All other people we forgot, who helped with their ideas\n\t\n\t*** License ***\n\t\n\nRatioMaster\nCopyright (C) 2005-2009, RatioMaster_06, moofdev.net\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in binary form, without modification, are permitted provided \nthat the following conditions are met:\n\n\t* Redistributions must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of \n\t  conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other \n\t  materials provided with the distribution.\n\t* Neither the name of the author nor the names of its contributors may be used to \n\t  endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior \n\t  written permission.\n\t* Redistribution of modified binaries allowed only with prior written permission \n\t  of the author.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&quot; AND ANY \nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES \nOF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. \nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE REGENTS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, \nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, \nPROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS \nINTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, \nSTRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF \nTHE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57fb3c9ee780a848826a72fb0e6a5a48a9bc4d39","amp;dn":"RatioMaster-1.8.1%2BMicrosoft+NET+framework+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57fb3c9ee780a848826a72fb0e6a5a48a9bc4d39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,251,60,158,231,128,168,72,130,106,114,251,14,106,90,72,169,188,77,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
