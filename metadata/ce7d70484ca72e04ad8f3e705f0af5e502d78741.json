This was an exciting release at the time for many Beefheart Fans especially, as it included a mixture of 'Live &amp; Unreleased Studio Recordings' inc the earliest known recording of a young Donnie Vliet alongside the Brothers Bobby &amp; Frankie Zappa. Recorded in 1959 in a classroom at the 'Antelope Valley High School' performing the self-penned composition &quot;Lost In A Whirlpool.&quot;\n\nTracks 2 &amp; 3 were from Frank Zappa's &quot;I Was A Teenage Maltshop&quot; Opera (also featuring Don on vocals.) followed by The 1966 'Avalon Ballroom' recordings (with the as-then 'Lost' 5th Track.), a couple of pre-Safe As Milk &amp; 'Wrapper' Acetates - most exciting at the time being &quot;Korn Ring Finger&quot; criminally left off the Sequel CD. Of most interest was extracts from a recently unearthed &quot;Trout Mask Rehearsal&quot; Tape, that until a few months earlier had only been rumoured to exist.\n\nThe relatively small run sold out extremely quickly and despite many of these recordings turning up years later on Revenant's &quot;Grow Fins&quot; 5CD Set, it is still a much sought-after CD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce7d70484ca72e04ad8f3e705f0af5e502d78741","amp;dn":"Captain+Beefheart%26ndash%3BThe+Early+Years+1959-1969","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce7d70484ca72e04ad8f3e705f0af5e502d78741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,125,112,72,76,167,46,4,173,143,62,112,95,10,245,229,2,215,135,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
