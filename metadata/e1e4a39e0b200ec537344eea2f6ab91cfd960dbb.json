The Law of Attraction in Action Episode 6\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania March 17, 2007\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFollow the path of enthusiasm.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nAbraham weighs-in on hot topics like climate change, winning the lottery, the chakra system, mediation, finding your path, vibrational communication, past lives, the school system and much more.\n\nFans around the world continue to praise this DVD series as a unique way to experience Abraham ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œliveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n\n\nHot Seat Question Details:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy question is about alignment. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had a desire for many years, to win the lottery. I feel very worthy of it. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m happy when I see other people win... I want to be really rich. I want to help other people. And I want to be able to prove to myself that I can manifest this desire.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAs I understand chakras, they are energy portals to the physical form and the energy patterns one holds within these different chakras, influences oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s choices and attracts by the nature of the energy that lies there... My question is about the validity of the chakra system and trying to work with it on daily choices and issues.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nHe still canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see his long-sought path. Abraham talks about giving your undivided attention to that which you have really become. They also talk about focussing on the pleasure of an experience in order to manifest it.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne of the big topics these days, that is a subject of heated discussion and political activity, is, climate change - global warming. Understanding that you look at things from a different perspective than most of us, I was wondering if you could enlighten us as to whether or not we should be doing something, or if it will all take care of itself anyway?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy brother Larry has Cerebral Palsy. He has a lot of love in him. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s somewhat savant. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m one of his care-givers. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really difficult for me to communicate with him... He doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get specific answering questions. I would like to have some insight from you Abraham, on how I can align myself with him - vibrationally.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m attached to this belief that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not safe. The feeling is around being very visible. I believe - from past lifetimes - that when IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been visible - IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been killed.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Abraham discusses the concept of past lives.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a psychotherapist. Is it of value to take a client back to relive trauma, so they can release feelings?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ AND ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow does the Emotional Guidance System work with people with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“anti-social personality disorderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - the mean, cruel people who seem to have no remorse?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ AND ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRegarding sexual abuse: How could it be manifested by the victim - by the pre-teen girl or boy?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nHis son is struggling in school. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow do you deal with the school administration when they call you and tell you his skills arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t up to par?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLife is an adventure - not a test.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEsther and Jerry Hicks are two grown-up children out for a good time! They cruise the highways of the USA, travelling from workshop to workshop, allowing attendees to visit with Abraham and ask any and all questions. The results stream forth in the form of books, CDs, DVDs and more.
