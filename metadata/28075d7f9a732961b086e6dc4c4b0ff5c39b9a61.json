No one else has bothered to throw these together yet into a set yet though, so I figured I&amp;#039;d post it. \n\nThe Batman R.I.P. storyline crosses over on five Batman books, with a prequel in DC Universe #0. Keep in mind that the real end to this story-line will occur in the pages of Final Crisis.  Shortly after--presumably due to the aftermath of the complete storyline-- Nightwing, Robin, and Birds of Prey are being cancelled in January. \n\nIncluded here is:\n\nDC Universe #0\nBatman #676-681 \nDetective Comics #846-850 \nNightwing #147-150 \nRobin #175-176 \nBatman and the Outsiders #11-13 \n\nAs always, Thanks to the original uploaders.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28075d7f9a732961b086e6dc4c4b0ff5c39b9a61","amp;dn":"Batman+RIP+%5Bh33t%5D+%5BAlieneye%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28075d7f9a732961b086e6dc4c4b0ff5c39b9a61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,7,93,127,154,115,41,97,176,134,230,220,76,75,15,245,195,155,154,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
