Now she returns with a bracing new novel, at once an intricate mystery and a rich human drama set in the high-stakes atmosphere of a prestigious research institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nSandy Glass, a charismatic publicity-seeking oncologist, and Marion Mendelssohn, a pure, exacting scientist, are codirectors of a lab at the Philpott Institute dedicated to cancer research and desperately in need of a grant. Both mentors and supervisors of their young postdoctoral protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©s, Glass and Mendelssohn demand dedication and obedience in a competitive environment where funding is scarce and results elusive. So when the experiments of Cliff Bannaker, a young postdoc in a rut, begin to work, the entire lab becomes giddy with newfound expectations. But CliffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rigorous colleagueÃ¢â‚¬â€œand girlfriendÃ¢â‚¬â€œRobin Decker suspects the unthinkable: that his findings are fraudulent. As Robin makes her private doubts public and Cliff maintains his innocence, a life-changing controversy engulfs the lab and everyone in it.\n\nWith extraordinary insight, Allegra Goodman brilliantly explores the intricate mixture of workplace intrigue, scientific ardor, and the moral consequences of a rush to judgment. She has written an unforgettable novel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdbadaf794fd62af174bc5226b95c2ffd91e5cdb","amp;dn":"Intuition+-+Allegra+Goodman.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdbadaf794fd62af174bc5226b95c2ffd91e5cdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,186,218,247,148,253,98,175,23,75,197,34,107,149,194,255,217,30,92,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
