This book describes recent research into methodologies and technologies for managing various forms of solid waste, while at the same time generating energy and revenue with less impact on the environment. Topics include combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal carbonization. The transition from a fossil fuel-based economy to a more sustainable economy will require a solid foundation of ongoing scientific research. The editor of this compendium, a well-respected researcher in the field, has selected studies that help to build that foundation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3819f6e665ac5aa31d4771f088baf3e912b3bda7","amp;dn":"Thermochemical+Waste+Treatment+-+Combustion%2C+Gasification%2C+and+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3819f6e665ac5aa31d4771f088baf3e912b3bda7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,25,246,230,101,172,90,163,29,71,113,240,136,186,243,233,18,179,189,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
