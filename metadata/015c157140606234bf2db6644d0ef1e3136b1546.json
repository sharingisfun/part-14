I think IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll just let the music tell the story. But before I let you go (I know--you were so close to getting rid of me) let me throw a few random thoughts your way: YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re gonna find some twisted versions of some old favorites and some really out there jams in some unexpected places with this helping of Driving Songs. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not uncommon for me to sit out front and hang on while the band takes me (and you, and themselves) to some uncharted territories. This tour had a lot of that. Something IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve always enjoyed is watching the band go somewhere where I seriously doubt they know where they are and yet somehow find their way out of it when it counts. That to me is Widespread Panic at their best. This collection is some of Widespread Panic at their best. And true to my word IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m gonna scoot out early this go ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“round.
