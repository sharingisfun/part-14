For young Jim Burden, who lives with his grandparents on a homestead nearby, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ntonia is an embodiment of the female pioneerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½self-sufficient, vigorous, and determined to withstand the daily challenges of maintaining home and family in a primitive countryside. When Jim grows up, his memories return to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ntonia. In his effort to understand what she meant to him, he creates an enduring picture of the American frontier and of a woman of unusual spirit.\n\n - - -\n\nIn 1923 Willa Cather was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;One of Ours&quot;, published in 1922.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09419e42d4c1eb57dba3e94bf844a580b57ad6de","amp;dn":"MY+ANTONIA+-+Willa+Cather.+Read+by+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09419e42d4c1eb57dba3e94bf844a580b57ad6de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,65,158,66,212,193,235,87,219,163,233,75,248,68,165,128,181,122,214,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
