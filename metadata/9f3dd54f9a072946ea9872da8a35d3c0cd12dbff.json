Cohen\n\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly:\n\n&quot;As a well-placed observer who knows intimately many of tinsel town's key players, Variety reporter and 25-year Hollywood insider Cohen reveals the story behind 25 scripts that became such high-profile projects as Lost in Translation, Troy, American Beauty and The Aviator. On the way, budding screen-writers convinced their own story seems like a long-shot will find inspiration (or at least comfort) in stories like Milo Addica and Will Rokos's, whose screenplay for Monster's Ball was rejected by top industry brass as 'the best script that will never get made.' \n\nWith the deep background reporting he's known for, Cohen produces revealing nuggets of moviemaking trivia, alongside stories of serendipity and triumph; for instance, had Erin Brockovich not shared a chiropractor with her future producer, Carla Santos Shamberg, her movie probably would never have been made. Nowhere is Cohen's understanding of the tempestuous film industry more apparent than in the compelling account of Black Hawk Down screenwriter Ken Nolan, who was terminated from that project only to get himself re-hired and, ultimately, sole writing credit. Cohen's is a surefire crowd-pleaser for casual movie fans and true cineastes.&quot;\n\n\nFrom Booklist:\n\n&quot;Variety reporter Cohen tells the stories of the scripts of several commercially and artistically successful recent films. Most were significantly tweaked to improve their commercial prospects. Some, such as those of Gladiator and My Best FriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wedding, underwent wholesale change on the way to the screen. American Beauty, TV scribe Alan BallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attempt to break into the movies, was among the rare few that survived largely intact. Cohen also inspects a few stinkers, like Random Hearts and Pay It Forward, whose stories are just as revealing and instructive, despite their unhappy endings. \n\nThe writers at issue range from novices to writer-directors John Waters, Sofia Coppola, and Todd Solondz, and include one of the few screenwriters considered a film auteur in his own right, Charlie Kaufman. Besides revealing each scriptÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s genesis and fate, Cohen recounts the writersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ backstories and includes commentary by many of the moviesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ stars. Almost any movie lover should enjoy the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s illuminating insight into how whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on the screen gets there, and aspiring screenwriters may be invaluably guided by the writersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ experiences.&quot;\n\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\n\nAnatomy of a Guerrilla Film: The Making of RADIUS (Paperback) by Helmut Kobler\n\n\n Want to make a guerrilla film of your own?
