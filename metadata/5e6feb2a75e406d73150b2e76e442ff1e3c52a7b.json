Wodehouse, first released in the United Kingdom as a serial in The Captain magazine between October 1909 and February 1910, and published in book form in the UK on 29 September 1915, by Adam &amp; Charles Black, London, and, from imported sheets, by Macmillan, New York, later that year.\nIt continues the adventures of the silver-tongued Psmith, one of Wodehouse's best loved characters, and his friend Mike Jackson.\n\nThe story begins with Psmith accompanying his fellow Cambridge student Mike to New York on a cricketing tour. Through high spirits and force of personality, Psmith takes charge of a minor periodical, and becomes imbroiled in a scandal involving slum landlords, boxers and gangsters - the story displays a strong social conscience, rare in Wodehouse's generally light-harted works.\n\nFile Information\n================\n Number of MP3s...: 12\n Total Duration...: 5 hours 42 minutes\n Total MP3 Size...: 191 MB            \n Encoder..........: LAME 3.98b8          \n Encoder Settings.: ABR 80 kbit/s 44100 Hz Mono          \n ID3 Tags.........: v1.1, v2.3 (includes embedded album art)\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
